The company also said that it has received board approval for a new share-repurchase program that will allow it to buy back up to $6.5 billion of its Class A shares, which will become effective after the company&apos;s prior $4 billion repurchase program is complete. The dividend announcement didn&apos;t help Mastercard&apos;s stock much, as shares are down roughly 4% in afternoon trading Tuesday amid a general market selloff and a early-morning filing from Mastercard that discussed inter-regional interchange fees in the European Union. Mastercard said it would reduce the interchange fees on cross-border transactions coming into European Economic Area companies to 0.2% for debit and 0.3% for credit, for card-present transactions. The company said it would lower card-not-present, or e-commerce, interchange fees to 1.15% for debit and 1.5% for credit. Mastercard also said it would pay a $650 million fine in the fourth quarter related to this issue. &quot;The issue appears to be resolved voluntarily, eliminating the risk, cost, and distraction of outstanding litigation, and even the potential negative impacts to the networks are modest,&quot; MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis wrote Tuesday.

While many companies in the Dow are considered blue chips, they certainly aren't created equal, nor are all the industrial average's dividend stocks necessarily safe bets for dependable income. In June 2018, for example, General Electric (GE) was booted from the index after having been a member for more than a century.

GE's share price had slumped more than 50% in the year leading up to the firm's removal from the Dow, and management also had cut the dividend for just the second time since the Great Depression.

To help identify the best dividend growth stocks in the Dow and avoid the GEs of the world, research firm Simply Safe Dividends utilizes a Dividend Safety Score system that has caught more than 98% of dividend cuts in advance.

We'll use that system to take a closer look at nine Dow dividend growth stocks that appear positioned to reward shareholders with safe and solid payout expansion in the years ahead.

But the rest of the industry is on to the trick. SQ stock has been hammered by the bear market in tech; the shares have tumbled by one-third over the last three months, while transaction processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) is down just 6% during the same period. Despite its recent weakness, SQ stock is still 42% higher than it was a year ago.

In tech, innovation is often followed by imitation. The innovator then needs to decide if it can innovate further or whether it's time to sell his or her company.

  * The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index 



This conflict has been fueling Square's volatility. The bears believe that SQ is close to being swamped by competition, and the bulls are calling on the company to sell itself.

### Square's Innovation

In 2010, SQ was founded and began providing products that allowed small merchants to accept credit cards. Square sold a free card reader that could be used with a smartphone. Its prices were high for the industry but lower than what the smallest merchants had to previously  pay for the same service. As a result, SQ stock was well-positioned.

Square used its profits to provide other services, including payroll services and small-business loans. It also bought a food-delivery service and a website-building company. 

Square has been growing quickly. Square's revenue for the first three quarters of 2018 exceeded its 2017 top line of $2.2 billion. It's expected to report &quot;monster&quot; revenue of $910 million when it announces its results on Feb. 6.

### Square's Competition

Small companies like Shopkeep are now competing directly against SQ, and larger processors are now on an acquisition binge, aiming to offer their own customers accounting services and financial capital. The larger companies in the space are also buying one another in an effort to scale up and expand around the world.

More important is the rise of fintech start-ups that are bypassing the credit-card-payment networks entirely. If the bear market really is followed by a recession, consumers around the world will be looking to cut costs, including the cost of using money, any way they can,. 

Meanwhile, fintech start-ups are using services like Plaid to enable everyone to access their money through their mobile phones. The cost of moving money is plummeting, and big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are, as usual, at the forefront of the change.

Square's response has been to try to get a charter for a bank, which like many other industrial banks would be based in Salt Lake City, where regulations are loose. The company has also brought in a new chief financial officer from Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), the video-game company.

### The Bottom Line on SQ Stock

SQ reported a third-quarter profit of $19.6 million, its first-ever quarter in the black. But it's not expected to be profitable this quarter.

As the company has grown, so have its expenses. It is facing new competitors from larger and smaller companies. Other payment processors are adding new software in an attempt to stay ahead of SQ.

A big bank, or merchant processor, could acquire Square for $101 per share,  the 52-week high of SQ stock, and justify the price, based on Square's successful franchise and its strong brand.  That offer would be irresistible to Square's management.

That's the best reason to buy Square stock now.

### Square: Valued Like a Bank?

One way that investors manage to lose lots of money, over and over, is by falsely labeling companies as &quot;tech&quot; outfits. Investors tend to give tech stocks, particularly in bull markets, extremely generous valuations.

The so-called Fintech sector was clever in marketing themselves as tech first, rather than as quasi-banks. Tech companies get way more investor enthusiasm than financial firms. This is a central part of the bearish case for Square stock in particular.

Bulls have long touted Square as a tech platform that should be valued in line with other innovative software or application firms. BTIG suggested otherwise, saying Square is much closer to a bank than the bulls would like to admit.

You could also make the middle ground argument that Square should be priced like a credit card company such as Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA).

However, both of these more favorable comparisons miss a major point. Pure tech companies usually don't lend to their customers, and the credit card companies tend to offload all the credit risk onto banks.

There is a reason the credit card operators routinely trade for 20-25x earnings while big banks are often under 15x earnings. Visa makes money on every transaction with minimal risk, whereas the bank issuing the credit card shoulders the risk of the consumer not paying.

Square is planting itself firmly in the bank category by lending directly to small businesses. This is arguably even riskier than normal credit card lending. Most consumers pay their credit card bills faithfully and generally only default if they lose their jobs or experience some catastrophe.

Small businesses, on the other hand, go bankrupt exceptionally often. More than 20% of restaurants fail in their first year, and more than 50% within the first three years, for example. You wouldn't lend to small businesses for long without taking major credit risk.

### Core Business Isn't That Large

There's always been an issue of just which customers Square should target. On the one hand, you had it making flashy deals with the likes of huge companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). On the other hand, Square's bread and butter has been small  (often very small) businesses.

Currently, Morningstar estimates that about half of Square's clients execute $125,000 or less in annual payments using Square's platform. In other words, just a few hundred dollars a day of payments on average.

That's fine and well, if Square can get tons of business of this size to stay loyal to its platform, it can eventually make profits. However, once businesses start doing more annual revenues, they tend to want to switch to much cheaper payments providers such as Global Payments (NYSE:GPN).

Thus, Square faces an inherent problem. You need tons of micro-businesses to reach profitable scale as a payments processor. But if you target more mid-sized businesses, then your profit margin on each transaction needs to come down a lot to stay competitive.

So far, it seems Square has struggled to find the right balance to achieve consistent profitability. That, in turn, is probably why it is spending so much energy on newer products like Cash App along with riskier direct lending to its customers.

### Square Stock Has Further to Fall

For Square stock, everything comes down to how the economy goes. If the economy keeps on humming and tech stocks recover from this correction, SQ stock will also come flying back. If the stock market and FAANGs hit new highs, SQ stock could even reach $100 again. But I'd argue Square is far from the best pick even if you are bullish on the market.

It's important to keep your downside risk in mind. So many tech companies with fantastic balance sheets, strong profits, and little credit or recession risk are trading down 30-40% over the past few months. Square, on the other hand, is much more of a gamble. We have no idea what sort of returns Square Capital, its lending arm, will produce during a recession, but odds are they won't be good.

More generally, Square's business model is still relatively unproven. Are there enough small businesses willing to pay Square's higher payment processing rates?

The company has been around quite awhile now and still hasn't found a path to consistent profits. Instead, it seems to be adding ancillary services such as lending, the Cash App, bitcoin trading, and so on to try to augment a core business that just isn't that promising.

If Square does reach solid profitability, a large part of that will probably come from its lending business. In that case, expect investors to view Square stock and trade it accordingly.

Put it all together, and you have a company that has more downside risk than other tech firms in a recession. The combination of credit risk and tech stock selling has formed a vicious circle for Square.

Even if things do turn around, Square will probably still underperform other tech outfits that have more compelling business models. With so many great tech companies on sale now, you can do better than SQ stock.

## Bitcoin

Cryptocurrencies have been one of the most talked-about subjects among investors in the last couple of years. Until the end of 2017, all looked well with the world’s largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, as it surged nearly 1,340% that year. It was the third consecutive year that bitcoin yielded a solid positive return, which caught the attention of even those investors who previously used to call it worthless. Last year, billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger warned about the cryptocurrencies (GBTC) bubble, which seems to have been bursting lately. Let’s take a closer look.

## Buffett and Munger on bitcoin bubble

During a CNBC interview about a year ago, Berkshire Hathaway chair and CEO Buffett said, “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending, when it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know.” He showed his confidence in his opinion by adding, “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime’s worth.”

Later in May 2018, Buffett’s long-time friend and Berkshire’s vice chair, Charlie Munger, went a step further. Munger called bitcoin “worthless, artificial gold.” He added, “that is not something I think the world needs.”

## And they were right

After yielding solid returns in 2017, bitcoin tanked over 73% in 2018. On Tuesday, it was trading below $4,000 with nearly 10% losses for the session.

In the last few years, many chipmakers (SPY) like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Intel (INTC) have invested in chips used for cryptocurrency mining. In the fourth quarter of 2018, AMD, NVDA, and INTC lost 40.2%, 52.5%, and 0.8%, respectively. During the same period, other US stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT), Overstock (OSTK), PayPal (PYPL), Square (SQ), Visa (V), Apple (AAPL), and Goldman Sachs (GS) also fell 11.2%, 51.0%, 4.3%, 43.3%, 12.1%, 30.1%, and 25.5%, respectively.",Buffett and Munger Called the Pop of the Bitcoin Bubble

2019-01-11,"While down slightly on Friday, the stock market has done a pretty good job of not giving up its gains from this multi-week rally. Now investors are starting to wonder just how much higher we can go without a correction. Let's look at a few of Friday's top stocks to get an idea of what's moving and what to watch for Monday morning. 

### General Motors (GM)

Shares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) are experiencing a nice surge on Friday, jumping more than 8% and hitting $38. Can it get over this mark?

That level has become notable over the past 15 months, but that doesn't mean it will act as resistance. After all, GM raised its 2018 outlook and provided a much better-than-expected outlook for 2019. Shares are not yet overbought, so if GM can continue higher on Monday or Tuesday, it will likely draw in buyers once it's over that mark.

As long as it stays over the 200-day, I like GM over a long-term outlook.

### Activision Blizzard (ATVI)

  
Click to Enlarge Unlike GM, it was a bad day in the C-suite for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). Shares tumbled almost 10% following some bad news about one of the company's largest game franchises. 

We're using a weekly chart above, but the daily chart showed a clean rally up to the 50-day moving average and a swift denial. We can see the same thing on the chart above, once ATVI was rejected from its 10-week moving average. 

It also failed to get back above its 200-week moving average, another unattractive development. In any regard, it continues to hold up over $45. Should ATVI lose this level, I have no interest in it on the long side -- not that I have much conviction in the first place.   


I would consider a short position on a close below $45, targeting at least last month's lows for a quick trade. Above the 200-week and I would get more interested from the long side.

### Tilray (TLRY)

  
Click to Enlarge We recently took a closer look at Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), looking for a possible breakout to $100 per share. At that mark now, some investors may consider taking profit. I would at least reduce my long position had you got in around this time. 

Should the cannabis space continue with its recent momentum, perhaps TLRY will have room up to $120. Bulls may consider using a close below the 50-day as their stop-loss. Just don't let this big winner turn into a loser.

### New Age Beverages (NBEV)

  
Click to Enlarge Speaking of strong cannabis stocks, could New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) be the next big mover? Shares have been trending higher and are above all three major moving averages. 

More importantly, it keeps butting up against downtrend resistance and a large breakout could be looming. 

Should it do so, traders could look at $7 as their first target and re-evaluate from there. It's a great risk/reward setup for bulls.

### Visa (V)

  
Click to Enlarge Visa (NYSE:V) is a long-term winner and I love its tollbooth-like business model. While falling gas prices won't do V any favors, strong holiday spending and record online sales bode well for credit card companies. 

Shares are technically holding up above downtrend resistance (blue line), but are also just over the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. That bodes well for the stock and puts a move back into the $140s on the table. 

Should it break down, bulls can use this trend line and these moving averages to limit their risk. If long-term investors are lucky, they'll get V on another pullback to ~$123. If support fails, see how the $130 to $133 levels holds up.

2019-01-16,"We're only a few days into earnings season and so far it's a mixed bag. Overall, bank earnings aren't suggesting there was an issue from the consumer side. Those that did poorly were mostly from a result of the Fed or fourth-quarter volatility. That bodes well for credit card companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP). AXP stock will be in the spotlight on Thursday when the company reports its quarterly results after the close.

Currently, analysts expect fourth-quarter earnings of $1.80 per share. If AXP hits this mark, it will represent 13.9% year-over-year (YoY) growth. American Express has beat earnings estimates for seven straight quarters. Worth noting, unlike some bank stocks, estimates haven't come down for AXP. In fact, they have climbed a penny per share over the last 30 days and are flat over the last 90 days. Despite this, the stock has been under pressure.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



On the revenue front, analysts are calling for sales of $10.56 billion in sales, representing a impressive YoY gain of 19.5%. Short of management providing disappointing guidance, it's hard to imagine AXP stock falling should the company beat these estimates.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Valuing American Express Stock

Analysts expect American Express to grow sales 20.8% in fiscal 2018 to $40.44 billion. For earnings, they're looking for $7.38 per share, 25.7% YoY. This leaves AXP stock trading at just over 13 times this year's earnings. That's cheaper than both Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) -- two stocks that I like very much.

I like V and MA for their consistency. With AXP, there's been a few more bumps in the road. Estimates call for a notable deceleration in growth in 2019, but analysts are still looking for positive results. Expectations call for 7.6% sales growth in fiscal 2019 and 10.2% earnings growth.

13 times earnings is reasonable for double-digit earnings growth in 2018 and 2019, and strong sales growth both years. Last quarter, AXP beat top- and bottom-line expectations, raised guidance and expanded its partnership with the fast-growing PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).

These are things we like to see from a company. From a fundamental perspective, AXP is attractive, although because of its loaning business, it does not operate solely on the &quot;tollbooth&quot; business like Visa and MasterCard. Online spending and holiday shopping was strong last quarter, which bodes well for all the credit card companies. One worry though? Falling gas prices. While lower gas prices is a boon for consumers, it hurts transaction revenue for companies like V, MA and AXP. Let's see if that impacts the top line this quarter.

### Trading AXP Stock

Shares are up about 10% off the recent lows, as AXP stock has gone from $89 to $98. Near $98, American Express stock has been consolidating nicely over the last few days. It's currently holding up over the 21-day moving average and earnings will decide if the next move is up or down.

So which is it?

A reaction to earnings ahead of the announcement is impossible to predict. But we can look at a few key levels to consider. For instance, on the downside, we have the 21-day just below current prices at $96.78. That's a little too close to expect it to hold as support. However, $95 has been notable and could stand up as support should AXP stock come under pressure. The last line in the sand comes down near $89 to $90. This mark has held up throughout 2018 and I would expect it to now, provided something horrible doesn't come from the quarter.

On the upside, The $100 to $102 level has been significant and may act as resistance going forward. It doesn't help that the 200-day is at $101 and the 50-day is just under $103. However, a 5% pop would clear AXP stock over all of these levels and make it an enticing post-earnings entry for bulls should the stock close above these levels.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Where AXP Stock Stands

Up until a week ago, traders believed that financial stocks could not rally. But that is starting to change lately  -- they have recently bought bank stocks up with both hands. This is thanks to good reactions to the Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) earnings reports. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF) is up more than 4% in the past 5 days on top of a 10% bounce off the December lows.

  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Rise of Menswear 



However, AXP stock this morning is not getting the love that the others did this week. Perhaps the disappointing Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) report on Thursday morning soured the mood a little on Wall Street. America Express did miss slightly on both earnings and revenues, but nothing that damages its sustainable bullish thesis.

AXP is not a bank, but credit card stocks do often trade alongside the traditional financial centers. American Express is financial technology stock, or FinTech, and those are faster movers than banks.

Consider one extreme stock of the bunch, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock, which is up 72% in the past year. Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are up 13%, 20% and 9% respectively for the same period. American Express stock is lagging, down 1%, so it has some catching up to do. This is reason number one to own it now -- while it still lags.

Yes, they disappointed the Street with their earnings, but if the stock market is going higher this year then AXP will recover and rally along. Management stated yesterday that they &quot;are starting 2019 in a position of strength.&quot; This is confidence that I can bank on, and the second reason to buy.

Thirdly and perhaps the reason with the biggest upside potential on the stock is China. The tariff war has been terrifying to Wall Street but it also presents a great opportunity for AXP stock. Part of its effort to resolve the face-off with the U.S., China is likely to open its doors to U.S. companies.

American Express has the best chance to be the first U.S. mover into a massive market, having already received preliminary approval. It will be competing with Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) Alipay and Tencent (TCEHY), but it is up to the task and will be a growth market for it.

Last night, management delivered decent guidance for 2019 but lacked the wow-factor. They raised their full year revenues but kept the same range on earnings per share. These days, investors want to see upgrades in guidance. But in the face of so much uncertainty, a cautious management team is a smart one. They are aware and realistic of opportunities and pitfalls.

The bottom line and as long as stocks are rising, AXP stock dips are buying opportunities in upwards moving markets.

There are some negatives like a slight increase in provisions for losses but nothing too alarming. After all we are in a rate hike cycle and this is when things can go wrong, but this is not 2008. We don't have flagrant systemic risk. Today's stocks prices are better founded with much less froth.

The negative reaction last night and this morning are too extreme. America Express stock is too good to be punished this harshly on a tepid report.

Nevertheless, the short-term reaction to earnings events are always binary so they don't matter much over time. So luckily they are just that, short term. With time the good fundamentals will prevail over this temporary tantrum.

For any bullish trade to work out we first need the macro-economic environment to allow for it. This year we are eliminating the major reasons that plagued the bulls last year. Recently the Federal Reserve assured us that they won't invert the yield curve on purpose. Now we only need to eliminate the tariff war threat. The rhetoric on that front are also improving as both sides are showing signs of lenience.

2019-01-22,"Over the past several years, Square (NYSE:SQ) has made a name for itself on both Main Street and Wall Street as a trusted payments processor that is at the heart of the cashless commerce revolution. This has propelled Square's revenues to more than double over the past three years, which has in turn led to a more than six-fold increase in Square stock.

Over the next several years, the narrative will be slightly different, but the results will be the same.

Square has been gradually and successfully turning into a bank. The company has developed multiple financial tech services catered to small businesses, the sum of which have been adopted in bulk. More important, they are posing a threat to the traditional banking industry.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks You Really Need to Look at for 2019 



As Square continues to grow its banking operations alongside is payment processing business over the next several years, the company has an unique ability to be a dominant player in both industries.

Here's the bull thesis. Major payments processors have $100 billion-plus market caps. So do major banks. Square has a market cap of just $30 billion.

Thus, while bears can pound on the table all they want about valuation, the big picture idea here is that you have a hyper-growth company attacking exceptionally large and valuable markets from a unique angle. Revenue growth is large. Margins are sky high. Earnings potential is enormous.

Overall, Square stock looks like it's still in the early innings of a multi-year growth narrative. As this narrative plays out, Square stock will only head higher, making this stock a solid long term buy-and-hold.

### Payments Processing Is a $100 Billion-Plus Opportunity

Before we jump into the banking side of Square, it's necessary to understand that Square stock has huge upside in a long term window through payments processing alone.

Digital and card payments are the future. Gone are the days of cash and coins and here are the days of credit cards and e-payments. As an enabler of non-cash payments across multiple channels, Square is at the core of this transition.

They have a brick-and-mortar presence through Square machines that allow retailers of all shapes and sizes to affordably and easily process card payments. They have an online presence through Square software which does the same thing for e-payments. Recently, they extended into the mobile game sector and now have payment software that can be incorporated into apps.

Overall, everywhere the consumer is these days, Square is there, too, making it easier and more convenient than ever to buy and sell things.

This is a huge market. It essentially comprises the entire global consumer spend pool. That pool measured $28 trillion in 2010, projects to measure $40 trillion in 2020, and will likely surpass $50 trillion in a decade.

Square has a market cap of just $30 billion today. Granted, that market cap is because the company only controls about 0.2% of global consumer spend today. But that share has been rising over the past several years. It will continue to rise because Square is only expanding its omni-channel presence.

As such, over the next several years, Square's market share should run up to 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1%, so on and so forth.

From this perspective, Square projects to be a major player in the global payments processing market. Major players in this market include PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V), and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). All three of those companies have market caps over $100 billion. Thus, at $30 billion, Square stock has plenty of runway through payments processing alone.

### Banking Is a $100 Billion Opportunity, Too

On the banking side of things, Square's opportunity is just as large and arguably even larger.

Square has made some quietly aggressive and smart moves in the banking sector over the past several quarters. Namely, the company has developed and continually improved a suite of fintech services catered towards small to medium sized businesses in the U.S.

These services include things like Square Capital, Square Payroll, and Square Card. They are essentially the same services that a big bank would offer businesses. They are just offered by Square instead.

Square is winning this battle. Why? Because traditional banking is old, with old technology and old faces and names. Square is the exact opposite. It's a new company, that is using new methods and new technology to create new solutions. They are new faces, new names, and new ideas.

It's a classic case of out with the old, in with the new. That's not to say big banks aren't adapting. They are. They will remain in control of this market for the foreseeable future. But, if the company's early successes in banking are a sign of anything, it is that Square will one day become a major player in this market.

Major players in this market all have $100 billion-plus market caps. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has a $230 billion market cap. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is at $340 billion. Bank of America's (NYSE:BAC) valuation hovers around $280 billion, while Citigroup (NYSE:C) is at $150 billion.

To reiterate for emphasis purposes, Square's market cap is a fraction of all those market caps at just $30 billion.

As such, through expanded operations in the financial services sector, Square has a tremendous opportunity to grow into something much, much bigger.

### Bottom Line on SQ Stock

Square stock has two $100 billion-plus opportunities in front of it in the payment processing and financial services sectors. More than that, the company is rapidly gaining ground in each sector and has visibility towards becoming a major player.

As such, with Square hovering around a $30 billion market cap, Square stock looks good here for big gains in the long run.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SQ, PYPL, and V.

Investors are shifting from a fear of losses to a fear of missing out, jumping on the boat even after big moves higher. Let's look at some of the biggest top stock trades for Friday.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #1: Microsoft

Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are in a precarious spot now after failing to rally on earnings. It's trading smack in the middle of its 21-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which are all within about 60 cents of each other.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 5 Dividend Stocks to Help You Through the Market's Mayhem 



It's got downtrend resistance just above and support in this $100 to $103 region just below. If tech stocks continue higher and the Nasdaq holds up, it's hard to imagine that MSFT will break below support. Below $100 and my concerns would rise, though.

Over resistance, and Microsoft could fly to its prior highs.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #2: Facebook

Shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are surging -- finally -- up almost 12% following its better-than-expected earnings results. FB stock was consolidating nicely below $150, which were the March/April lows from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

With Thursday's move, shares are erupting over this mark and are now pinning near the 200-day moving average. If it can't hold the 200-day, it will likely serve as temporary resistance.

However, given how much pressure FB has been under over the past few quarters, a continued move is certainly not out of the question. I find it worthwhile to mention that today's high perfectly kissed the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the July highs to the December lows. If FB pulls back and/or consolidates, look for the 38.2% Fib to buoy it as well as uptrend support (purple line).

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #3: PayPal

Shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are pulling back slightly on the day, contrary to what the bulls were hoping for when PYPL reported earnings. However, it's holding up over the backside of prior downtrend resistance and is a great company.

I like this one from the long side, with prior downtrend resistance, the 50-day and the 200-day moving average all just below. Investors buying on Thursday, or Friday on another slight decline, can use the $84 level as their stop-loss.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #4: Visa

Visa (NYSE:V) has a similar -- albeit not identical -- chart to Microsoft. The main difference is that V doesn't have as much support below it. On a day where MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is running, V is under pressure following its earnings results.

Keep it simple: support rests down near $130 and V will need to close above $138 to trigger a breakout. This one has a great long-term story and investors should feel comfortable nibbling a longer-term position down here.

### Top Stock Trades for Friday #5: Raytheon

Shares of Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) are down slightly, falling about 4% after reporting earnings. But this one has come up quickly from its recent lows and is also a high-quality company.

I like RTN -- although perhaps not as much as a few other in-favor stocks at the moment -- particularly if it's able to hold its 21-day and 50-day moving averages. If so, a continued rally is not out of the question. Over time, it may even make its way back up to the $185 to $190 level.

Below $160 and RTN would raise a red flag for me, but if I am a short-term investor or long-term trader (however you want to think about it) I would not be all that disappointed with Thursday's fall following its big rally.

Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via Flickr Visa is a quality company which makes V stock one to hold for the long term. Small dips on headlines are not critical for the overall long-term investment. Those who need exposure to the financial sector should consider buying Visa stock. 

This is not 2018. Last year, sentiment was terrible and markets could not maintain a rally. This was especially true for the financials and consensus was that they could not sustain rallies. But transactor companies like Visa, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and even Square (NYSE:SQ) have the best of both world.

When financial stocks rally, V stock also rallies. But if the bank stocks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) fall, the transactors only fall in sympathy for a short while. Then they continue to move with the markets in general, not the banks.

  * 5 Dividend Stocks to Help You Through the Market's Mayhem 



So far this year the macro-sentiment has been the opposite of December. The Christmas crash, as bad as it was, did flip the switch. Thus far, the bears have failed this year.

Case in point: last night, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is a stock that has many haters, spiked 9% on their earnings headline. Sellers couldn't even materially hurt a controversial stock like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) who faces a slew of serious challenges.

So, unless things change again, I expect the bulls to remain in control. The macroeconomic conditions are still strong in spite of a few pockets of weakness. Overall, companies are delivering strong P&Ls. So shorting here makes little sense.

### Trading Visa Stock

I am already long American Express (NYSE:AXP) and profitable with it. But Visa stock is another one I'd buy here. This would be a trade I can hold for years.

My approach to this also has short-term opportunity. Technically, V stock has been trading in a tight range for January. And coming into the earnings event it was trading just below a potential breakout line. When that happens, a breakout from a tight range usually over shoots in that direction once the limit is breached.

In this case, if Visa can rise above $140 per share it can invite more buyers. The upside target could then target the $150 zone. There are a few spots of potential resistance along the way. First at $141 and $142.20 per share which were failure levels on December 12th and 7th respectively.

Then, there is a bigger pivot point at $145.75 which was an important island reversal on December 4. Breaking out of that one can really heat the rally up. Will there be dips? Likely. But in the long run, if the markets are higher then so is Visa stock.

Investors aren't going to regret buying shares at this valuation over the years. Visa sells at a 33 price-to-earnings ratio which is in line with MA but much cheaper than PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which sells at 50 P/E and SQ who still loses money. Only AXP is cheaper from that perspective.

### The Bottom Line for Visa Stock

I believe that from here, the blindside is to the upside for Visa stock. Meaning the likelihood of an upside surprise is far greater than a trap door. Consider the fact that the resolution to the China/U.S.tariff standoff could include an open door to Visa and its competitors to enter the Chinese markets unrestricted. If that happens, then the upside is massive.

The analysts on Wall Street agree. They almost uniformly rate V stock as a BUY yet it is still trading much lower than their price range. They too believe that more upside is definitely the likely scenario for years.

2019-01-31,"Mastercard Inc.  shares are up nearly 4% in premarket trading after the payments giant reported mixed fourth-quarter results, beating on earnings but delivering in-line revenue. The company posted net income of $900 million, or 87 cents a share, up from $200 million, or 21 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 

Source: Shutterstock From a headline perspective, the quarter wasn't very good. Earnings topped expectations, but revenues were simply in-line with estimates. That's a shocker for this company. PayPal normally beats on both the top and bottom line. Indeed, this is the first time in two years that PayPal didn't report a double-beat quarter. Also, the first quarter guide came in light of expectations, heightening investor concerns that slowing global economic growth is weighing on PayPal. 

All in all, a glance at the headline numbers makes the drop in PayPal stock seem obvious and warranted. But a closer look reveals that this dip is a buying opportunity.

The core trends underlying PayPal stock remain robust, and the fourth-quarter report affirmed that. Total payment volume growth, engagement growth, revenue growth and margins were all stable in the quarter. Meanwhile, account growth and Venmo volume growth actually accelerated higher in the quarter. Plus, the guide next year calls for continued robust revenue growth and healthy margin expansion, while management said on the conference call that &quot;economic growth is stronger and more resilient than recent market volatility would indicate.&quot;

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Overall, PayPal's quarter wasn't bad. At all. Instead, it was business as usual -- and business as usual projects to be the norm in 2019, as well. So long as business as usual persists, PayPal stock will remain on an uptrend and dips will be buying opportunities.

### Underlying Growth Trends Remain Favorable

It's easy to look at PayPal's quarter, see that a 30-forward-multiple stock didn't double-beat expectations and write off the sell-off in PayPal stock as an overvalued stock suffering from a slowing growth trajectory.

But that isn't what's happening here.

PayPal's growth isn't really slowing at all. Total payment volume growth in the quarter was 25%. This figure has run in the 20% to 30% range for several quarters now, so the fourth quarter's 25% mark is very normal. Also, fiscal 2019 total payment volume growth is projected to be 25% -- again, a very normal number for this company.

Engagement growth was also stable in the quarter at 9%, while adjusted revenue growth was also stable at 21%. Next year, adjusted revenue growth is expected around 20%, implying year-over-year stability. Margins also held largely stable in Q4, and are expected to gradually expand in 2019.

Elsewhere, growth rates actually improved. Account growth accelerated to 17% in the quarter, from a 10-15% range that the metric had been stuck in for several quarters. Venmo volume growth also accelerated to 80%, after being stuck at 78% for two consecutive quarters.

Overall, the underlying growth trends at PayPal remain healthy and vigorous. Moreover, management projects those trends to remain healthy in 2019, thanks to a still-favorable economic backdrop. As such, 2019 will be business as usual for PayPal.

Business as usual has led to PayPal stock more than doubling over the past three years. It should lead to similar big gains over the next several years.

### Valuation Lends Itself to $100 Prices Soon

The post-earnings sell-off in PayPal stock has dragged the stock price down below $90. The stock won't stay there for long. Within the next several months, PayPal stocks should rise toward and above $100.

The math here is simple. PayPal has been a consistent adjusted revenue-grower in excess of 20%. This year is expected to be largely more of the same. Growth will inevitably slow over the next several years thanks to the law of large numbers. But, secular growth drivers in e-commerce and mobile commerce will keep growth healthy over the next several years. Thus, this is easily a 15% revenue grower that could hit $36 billion in revenue by fiscal 2024.

During that stretch, margins will expand gradually with scale, but will remain largely within the 20-25% range. Gradual margin expansion on top of big revenue growth should propel EPS towards $7 by fiscal 2014. Payment processor stocks, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), normally trade around 25 forward earnings.

Based on a 25 forward multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2023 price target for PayPal stock is $175. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target just shy of $120.

### Bottom Line on PYPL Stock

The growth trends underlying PayPal stock remain favorable, mostly due to resilient economic growth and continued expansion of e-commerce and mobile commerce. So long as these growth trends remain favorable -- and the valuation remains reasonable, as it does today -- PayPal stock will trend higher, and dips are nothing more than buying opportunities.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PYPL and V.

2019-02-11,"Square (NYSE:SQ) has outperformed the stock market and most other names since tech stocks' Christmas Eve lows. Square stock is up more than 40% from its lows and is now consolidating nicely near $70 per share.Square is far from perfect, though. The stock is much more volatile than the broader market and is susceptible to large moves in both directions. With the market teetering on a potential pullback ( it has risen some 15% from its December lows and is rapidly moving towards its 200-day moving average), Square stock could either be a pillar of strength or a weak link in the chain. Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)If investors eliminate their emotions and rely on unbiased logic, they have a chance to profit from SQ stock. So let's look at the charts a bit before diving into a wider overview of Square stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months  Trading Square StockSQ is holding up relatively well, particularly with the overall markets under some pressure after a big, multi-week rally. So far, SQ stock is staying above its 200-day moving average, which is near $69. This appears to be a rather key level when it comes to Square stock. The 200-day was resistance about a month ago, but once Square pushed through the 200-day, this level became support.Furthermore, short-term, uptrend support (depicted by the blue line on the chart above) comes into play around $69 as well and follows the 200-day moving average pretty closely. On a slightly deeper pullback, the risk/reward of Square stock would be solid for bulls.For bulls who are already long, a close below this area gives them a way to reduce their risk. If Square stock temporarily breaks below $69 and recovers in the same day, I would be much more likely to consider taking a long position in Square stock. That scenario would signify that the support of Square stock temporarily gave way, and that bulls responded by buying the shares with enough force to get them back over the key level of $69.So what happens if SQ falls below $69? If that happens, $65 is on the table. That's about the level where trend support (depicted by the black line) and  the 50-day moving average come into play. If $69 holds, becoming support, look to see if Square stock moves over $72 to $72.50. That area is both short-term, downtrend resistance and the 100-day-moving average. If Square stock climbs above $72.50, it could retest its recent highs near $78.Know your levels and let the price action guide your actions. Don't fight what the stock price is doing. The Bottom Line on SQ StockSquare is not cheap and never really has been. However, investors counter the valuation argument with a few observations.Their first contention is that Square could be a takeover target for banks and/or payment processing companies. Perhaps the recent massive deal between SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI) and BB&T (NYSE:BBT)will kick M&A in the financial sector into high gear.Presently, Square stock is valued at just under $30 billion. It's also got a surprisingly resilient balance sheet. SQ has total assets of almost $4 billion versus total liabilities of $2.8 billion, while the company has less than $1 billion of total debt.SQ is not on the list of stocks with the strongest balance sheets, but I was surprised that Square wasn't more leveraged. The fact that SQ has positive cash flow also makes Square stock more attractive.The bulls' other argument is the company's  growth. Square will report its earnings at the end of February, and analysts expect the company to report strong, full-year growth. On average, analysts expect its sales to surge 60% to $1.58 billion and predict that its earnings will balloon 70% to 46 cents per share.As mentioned earlier, the valuation of SQ stock is high; the shares are trading at 156 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. But it's not easy to find companies that are  growing as quickly as Square. In 2019, the average estimate calls for a further 43% expansion in sales to $2.25 billion and projects that its earnings will grow 52% to 70 cents per share.SQ stock is still expensive, as it's far more costly than its peers like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). But growth investors won't mind its high valuation as long as its management continues to deliver.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Those charts are Visa (NYSE:V), D. R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Here's what to note. D. R. Horton (DHI)Last week Lennar (NYSE:LEN) was noted as a budding breakout candidate. Earlier in the month, rival homebuilder PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) was dropping the same hints.  * 10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market's Blitz Higher D. R. Horton is knocking on that door as of last week's close. One more good day could get it over the hump.  Click to Enlarge • That hump is the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts. DHI pushed above that level earlier in the week only to fall back below it, but the bulls were quick to put it back in the hunt.• Zooming out to the weekly chart we see multiple buy signals, including a bullish MACD cross and a Chaikin line that's back above zero.• If the brewing breakout effort can take hold, the most plausible upside target is around $46.40, where D. R. Horton was capped for the better part of last year. Amazon.com (AMZN)A couple of bad days for a stock isn't necessarily the end of the world. It happens. But, when a high-profile market darling is not only skipping out in a month-long marketwide rally because it's bumping into familiar technical resistance, that's a red flag.That's Amazon.com right now. It got January started with a bang, but has been suspiciously weak of late. As of Friday, it's resting on a last-ditch perch that's preventing the sellers from pulling the rug out from underneath it.  Click to Enlarge • The precision with which the rally was stopped is the key concern. All it took as a brush of the white 200-day moving average line in mid-January and then again in late January to push AMZN to lower lows.• As of Friday's last trade, the purple 50-day average line is holding up as support, but just barely. The next move under it could start a profit-taking avalanche.• The one thing working in the stock's favor right now is the lack of volume behind the selling, although there has been a distinct lack of buying volume as well. Visa (V)Two months ago Visa was in real trouble … as were most names. It plugged into the same rebound that sent most stocks higher in January though, and is not only out of trouble, bat may be on the verge of a major move. That move should be higher too, given the recent action.Ideally though, before breaking out, Visa would peel back a little, regroup, and then put the breakout thrust in place at a more sustainable pace.  Click to Enlarge • The line in the sand $146, plotted with a white dashed line. V is on pace to push above that level, but has become overextends since its mid-January low.• There's even more going on here than initially meets the eye. On the weekly chart we can see two years' worth of unfettered rally that drove a divergence of all the key moving average lines. That divergence was reversed into a convergence last month -- highlighted on the daily chart -- which provides fuel for a fresh divergence.• Though the undertow is bullish, a dip back to the blue 20-day or gray 100-day moving average lines would let the rally &quot;reset&quot; and provide a chance for the purple 50-day average to cross back above the white 200-day line … a buy signal in and of itself.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-25,"Stocks are starting the week with a bang. Fueled by positive developments from ongoing bilateral trade talks between the U.S. and China, the market gapped higher this morning. Should the optimism hold, we may be in for an intense week of gains. To prepare yourself, we're offering up three of the best trades for the week.This year's relentless rise has created no small number of big winners. Uptrends litter the landscape making the game of discovering bullish opportunities a cinch. The trick is to find low-risk entries and avoid the temptation to chase stocks that are already extended from established support zones.Active traders preach the importance of deploying positions when the risk is low and the potential reward is high. That way, even if your win rate sinks below 50% you still stand a chance for profitability.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills My weekend surveying revealed these three companies are among the best trades right now. Facebook (FB)Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) tops our list with a gorgeous pullback pattern. Ever since the social media king pole-vaulted on earnings last month, I've been waiting for a low-risk setup to provide a better entry point. Because of the magnitude of the up-gap, I was leery of chasing.Thus far, my patience has paid. The three-week retracement that has since formed is creating a clean buy the dip opportunity. The rising 20-day moving average came into play last week, and buyers emerged to defend their newfound turf. With this morning's jump, FB stock is starting its next up-leg. And that makes now an appropriate time to pull the trigger for bullish trades.With low implied volatility, buying cheap options is the way to go. If you're willing to bet FB climbs toward $180 in the weeks to come, then buy the May $160/$180 bull call spread for $8.50. Apple (AAPL)Like Facebook, the recent earnings report in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sparked a new uptrend and cemented its bottom. Since then, AAPL stock has toed the bullish line with nary a misstep. The two-week pause that settled on the stock after its post-earnings run allowed overbought pressures to ease and established an easy base to build a breakout trade from.Friday's ramp and today's follow-through is indicating the consolidation period is finished and the uptrend is ready to run again. And that makes AAPL one of the best stocks to buy right now. Like its predecessor, AAPL boasts cheap options with an implied volatility rank of 21%.  * 7 Cheap Stocks That Make the Grade To capitalize, I suggest buying the May $175/$185 bull call spread for $4.25. Visa (V)Visa (NYSE:V) rounds out today's trio with an easy to spot breakout pattern. Ever since October's breakdown, resistance at $145 has proven impenetrable. Multiple attempts to dethrone its dominance were rejected in short order.Until Friday, that is.With broad market strength at its back, buyers finally felled the ceiling. Although the breakout wasn't as epic as others, it was a resistance breach regardless. And with the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages all rising loyally beneath, I think Visa is cleared for a re-test of last year's highs at $151.56.Since market uncertainty has been thoroughly squashed, V stock carries ultra-low implied volatility as well. The rank is 7%, making option buys the easy choice here. Buy the April $145/$150 bull call spread for $2.75.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-28,"Last night Square (NYSE:SQ) management reported earnings and SQ stock investors absolutely did not like what they saw. Not as much as they hated the Box (NYSE:BOX) earnings report but nonetheless, the stock is down more than 4% in early morning trading.Source: Via SquareManagement reported a decent scorecard meeting, beating the metrics on the top and bottom lines. SQ even had strong triple-digit growth in services and subscriptions. But as is the case these days, they guided lower than expected going forward. Wall Street demands to be wowed, or else they punish the stock on earnings events.And therein lies the opportunity with Square stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese dips on earnings that don't come from bad execution are usually opportunities for those who want to go long the stock. SQ is a momentum stock so it almost never allows for an easy trade. On the way up it always seems too high to chase and on the way down it looks like it is falling into a chasm.This morning, Square stock is falling into a short-term support zone around $74 per share. But even if this one fails, It will have strong support through $70 per share. In the long run, the $4 differences between levels won't matter much, especially for a fast mover like this. How to Trade SQ Stock After EarningsYear-to-date, SQ stock came into earnings up 40% so it can afford a few red ticks. Furthermore, for the past 12 months, it is up 70%. This is not the case of BOX, where it is losing growth; SQ is still firing on all cylinders.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market So while 2019 has been great so far, 2018 ended badly when the whole market crashed into year-end. Since then, SQ stock fell 50% from the September highs but it has recovered half of it back from when the correction started. The slide ended on Christmas and since then it's up 45% even after this dip.Those who missed the rally will want back in and it will be a matter of finding the right levels.Fundamentally, I like the transactor companies like this. The gang includes Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The world is migrating to complete electronic payments and these companies are the ones that will make it happen. SQ is the most expensive of them, but it is also so far the most exciting. So, for now, the valuation won't matter much to investors as long as it delivers on growth.Cautious guidance does not mean Square stock deserves a 4% drop. This could be management managing expectations going into a tumultuous geo-political situation where nations are in tariff-war showdowns. Wall Street has a history of over-loving momentum stocks. Much like the situation with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for example. At $290, everyone loved it, but when it fell from grace, very few outspoken fans remained.To that I say that it's not bad because this is human nature; we even have a term for it: FOMO. Both extremes are wrong, so somewhere in the middle lies the truth. It's dips like these that bring the hopium back to more reasonable levels.Surprisingly, a momentum stock that has run up this fast usually sports an overly exuberant ranking among Wall Street experts. But currently, analysts who cover it are split between BUY and HOLD as it trades in the middle of their price range for it. I doubt that given that they beat their targets, there will be a deluge of downgrades. Maybe on the dip some of them will see the opportunity and Square stock may even get a few upgrades.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-02-28,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Last night Square NYSE SQ management reported earnings and SQ stock investors absolutely did not like what they saw Not as much as they hated the 160 Box NYSE BOX earnings report but nonetheless,Is Square Stock a Solid Buy on This Earnings Dip?
2019-02-28,"This morning, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock initially dropped before quickly reversing course. The payments processors reported fourth-quarter numbers that were largely above expectations, but included a mixed guide. Investors were initially disappointed by a weak Q1 profit guide. But they shrugged that off, and instead focused on an above-consensus full-year 2019 revenue and profit guide. Consequently, SQ stock reversed course, and ended up trading higher on the day.Source: Via Square This reversal makes sense. Square's Q4 numbers were strong and underscored that the company's underlying secular growth drivers in non-cash payments processing and digital banking remain robust. The full-year 2019 guide implies that these drivers will remain robust for the foreseeable future. As such, a weak Q1 profit guide is just a hiccup in what is otherwise a very strong growth narrative. It should be ignored, and SQ stock should trade higher on these good numbers. In the big picture, SQ stock is a long-term winner. The company is capitalizing on a secular shift towards non-cash payments, while simultaneously building out multiple digital banking initiatives, the sum of which will keep Square's growth rates high and strong for a lot longer. Margins are also ramping with great pace, and profits are soaring.But, SQ stock is already up 700% over the past three years. How much more upside is left?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the long term, a lot. In the near term, only a little. Based on reasonable growth assumptions, Square stock remains on a winning track towards $150-plus price tags. But, over the next few months, fundamentals imply that upside is capped around $85. As such, I wouldn't be buying SQ stock in bulk here. But, I wouldn't be selling either. This stock remains a long-term buy-and-hold. Strong Q4 Numbers Paint A Positive PictureSquare's Q4 numbers were really good. Net revenues rose by over 50% again. Adjusted revenues rose by over 60% again. Gross Payment Volume, or GPV, growth was again above 25%. GPV mix improved to include 24% of sellers with greater than $500,000 in annualized GPV, versus 20% last year and 16% two years ago. Adjusted Subscription and Services-Based revenue more than doubled year-over-year.Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded roughly 300 basis points year-over-year, continuing what has been a multi-year margin expansion narrative. On top of 60%-plus adjusted revenue growth, this margin expansion powered 97% year-over-year EBITDA growth.All in all, Square's quarter was very good. To be sure, there are some lingering concerns regarding slowing GPV growth. GPV growth has decelerated from 30%-plus a few quarters ago, to under 30% in each of the past two quarters. This signals that the non-cash payments processing tailwind is slowing, which isn't great news.But, it's not deal-breaking news either. Of course, growth will naturally slow here. The fact that it's only slowing by ~1 percentage point each quarter despite being up at 30% and lapping 30%-plus growth is actually impressive. Moreover, the big growth narrative here isn't GPV growth. It's over on the subscription and services side of Square, where Square is building a banking ecosystem surrounding its core payments platforms. Revenue in those businesses is more than doubling year-over-year. That revenue is also high-margin, so it's additive to the bottom-line and is helping drive profit growth.Thus, while GPV growth is slowing, Square's Q4 numbers underscore that this company remains on a winning trajectory. The company continues to be a 20%-plus grower in payments processing, and is building out a robust portfolio of ancillary payments and banking related products like business payments cards and a mobile money app, most of which are seeing incredible traction. So long those businesses continue to ramp, Square will remain a big revenue grower with a strong margin expansion narrative. Long-Term Drivers Imply Big UpsideFrom a valuation perspective, SQ stock has healthy long-term upside. But, upside in the near term will likely be capped by what is becoming an increasingly full valuation.Considering Square's relatively small GPV (less than $100 billion annualized), huge addressable payments market ($40 trillion in global consumer spend) and persistently large growth rates (25%-plus GPV growth has become the norm for several years), it increasingly appears as though Square's payments processing business will continue to be a 20% grower for a lot longer. Meanwhile, considering how well all of its other subscription and service businesses like Cash App are doing, it also increasingly appears that revenue growth on that side of Square will likewise remain well in excess of 20% for the foreseeable future.Meanwhile, margins are consistently rising by roughly 200 basis points every year. So long as robust revenue growth persists, this trend of 200 basis points of margin expansion every year should persist, too.Putting all that together, I think Square projects as a 20%-plus revenue grower for a lot longer, while margins should continue to ramp towards 30% in the long run. Modeling those assumptions out, I believe Square can do about $4.25 in EPS by fiscal 2025.MVP stocks -- Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) -- all trade around 30 to 35 forward earnings. Based on a peer average 32.5 forward multiple, a reasonable 2024 price target for SQ stock is close to $140. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $85. Bottom Line on SQ StockStrong Q4 numbers and a healthy fiscal 2019 guide imply that Square remains on a winning trajectory, powered by secular growth drivers in non-cash payments processing and various digital banking initiatives. If Square can stay on this winning trajectory, then price tags close to $150 make sense for SQ stock in the long run.  * 9 Best Stocks to Buy on U.S.-China Trade Optimism Having said that, valuation looks pretty full in the near term.

2019-03-04,"Why Kroger (KR) Stock Won;t Get a Boost From Battling VisaUpset over the fees Visa (NYSE:V) charges it to handle customer transactions, Kroger (NYSE:KR) is halting its acceptance of Visa cards at some of its outlets, and considering a nationwide ban of Visa cards. That is a huge deal for Kroger and KR stock because Visa has more than half the credit card market, and customers continue to use cash less frequently.This could be a huge deal for Visa as well, since Kroger is the second-largest grocery-store chain in America, behind only Walmart (NYSE:WMT). If Walmart, or even eighth-place Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) join the fight, things could get nasty.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Stocks to Buy for March The trouble for KR stock is that they're not joining the fight. Kroger, which is due to release its results through January before the market opens on Mar. 6, is all alone. KR stock is already suffering, as it has dropped 5% over the last few trading days. Kroger's Worst NightmareI am Kroger's worse nightmare.When I go to Kroger, usually about twice each week, I use a Visa card. I only use one credit card and one debit card. Both carry the Visa logo.I often spend only $10-$20 on each visit because I make my big purchases at Costco (NASDAQ:COST).  I use the automated check-out, plug the card in, take my groceries and go. I'm in-and out in ten minutes.But Kroger's hangover is just beginning. It costs KR 21 cents to process my transaction and could cost as much as 35 cents if I were using a small bankGrocery margins are wafer-thin. Kroger is fortunate when it brings 2 cents of every dollar to its bottom line. During the third quarter, which ended on Halloween, its profit margin was slightly over 1%.  If I spend $10 and it costs KR 35 cents to process my card, it's losing money.Settlement fees aren't the only hassle. Merchants are also subject to fees when their merchandise is returned. Taken together, the average merchant pays about 2.5% of the revenue it gets from credit cards in fees to the card networks and banks.KR can't get mad at me. I wouldn't understand. There's a Walmart just as close to me, in the other direction. So, Kroger is getting mad at Visa. Smith's, a Kroger-branded store in the Rocky Mountain region, will be no longer accept Visa cards starting on Apr 3. Kroger's Food 4 Less chain in California has already stopped accepting Visas. Going to CourtThe rest of the industry has chosen to go to court to fight these so-called &quot;swipe fees,&quot; and recently made a $6.24 billion settlement  The settlement covers 14 years and follows a preliminary deal last year some merchants said didn't go far enough. Visa and rival MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which was also part of the case, thought that was the end of the battle. They're already contemplating a new price hike, which could go into effect as early as next month, and while the increase will only be assessed to the banks the networks do business with, it's assumed those banks will pass the costs on to merchants. The Bottom Line on KR StockKR stock is an incredible bargain. It has a price-earnings ratio of 6.3, and its market cap of $22.6 billion is about one-sixth its fiscal 2018 sales of $122 billion. The tiny, 14-cent-per-share-dividend paid to owners of Kroger stock currently yields 1.9%.But KR stock has been cheap for a long time It currently trades below where it was two years ago, despite two dividend hikes. I've suggested that Kroger stock could rise if KR consolidated under one brand ; it currently has 17. At least it now has a quest. Too bad that quest looks like an impossible dream.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-08,"Worldpay (NYSE:WP) stock is in the financial world's transaction services sector. And it has been there a very long time under various forms.Source: Shutterstock Basically, transactions servicing is moving money from consumers to merchants or to banks, or any combination of those transactions. It may be easier to think of what Visa (NYSE:V) does -- it's the middleman in transactions, assuring a safe and accurate movement from one account to another.The key difference between what WP and V do is, Worldpay it doesn't have a consumer facing business. It focuses more on working among financial institutions and merchants.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs the world becomes more digital, and we start to transition to the first phase of a cashless society, these payment processing firms are starting to gain global traction.You see, the move to e-commerce is in the interest of financial institutions, merchants (especially large, multinational ones) and even governments. E-commerce provides a digital trail that can be followed from one account to another.That means banks don't have to deal with counting, storing and moving bulky cash. For merchants, they don't have to count it, deposit it and leave some sitting around for various payouts to vendors, etc.  * 5 Airline Stocks In Serious Trouble This is why businesses and financial institutions love the concept of cashless. It makes transactions and account transfers frictionless. The History of WP StockAnd this is what payment processors like WP do. They allow these payments to flow with as little friction as possible while keeping everything organized, secure and transparent. Originally a spinoff from regional financial institution Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) around 1990 to help it expand its ATM business, it continued to find opportunities in the growing transaction services sector.In 2011, that spinoff became Vantiv and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012.Since then, like most of the big players in this sector, it has been on a buying spree, snapping up smaller firms in the sector. This has been the strategy for growth since it's cheaper (for now) to buy a small firm in a particular sector or region than it is to try to compete and establish your own brand.By 2017, Vantiv was one of the Forbes 2017 Fast Tech 25 as one of the fastest growing tech firms in the U.S.It's no surprise then, that at the same time Vantiv had been in and out of talks with the UK's largest payment processing company, Worldpay. In late 2017 they cut a deal.Vantiv bought Worldpay for $10.4 billion. And after all was said and done, Vantiv took the name Worldpay and now covers 146 countries, 126 transaction currencies and 300 alternative payment forms, and processes 40 billion transactions a year.And the thing is, WP stock's market cap is about one tenth the size of V and Mastercard. That makes it a very interesting growth stock in a high-growth sector for the next five years or more.And at some point, it may even be a merger target of one of the big financial institutions looking to get into the space.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

2019-03-12,"Stocks continued their recent momentum from Monday, again rallying higher on Tuesday. Companies like Boeing (NYSE:BA) remain on shaky ground, while plenty of other big movers drew our attention. Let's look at some top stock trades for Wednesday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Stitch FixShares of Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) are ripping on Tuesday, up more than 25% after better-than-expected earnings. It's hard to be disappointed with a move like that, but given how far off its highs this one finished and it does cause some concern.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks That Deserve Your Attention in 2019 There's a big short interest in this one, so it's totally possible it starts to scream higher on Wednesday. If it loses Tuesday's lows though, a drop down to $32 is likely. Over this $34.50-ish area -- which has been notable but is also the 50% retracement mark for the 52-week range -- and SFIX could retest Tuesday's high.Above it and a short-squeeze could fuel it higher to fill that gap up near $44. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: MomoUp more than 12% on Tuesday post-earnings and Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO) is no slouch either. However, like SFIX we could have seen a stronger finish to the day.MOMO couldn't stay above its 200-day moving average, but on the plus side, it's over the $34 to $35 range, a key area over the past year. Plus, it hurdled its 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level near $34.25. If it can continue higher, look for Momo to clear the 200-day and perhaps challenge $40.On the downside, look to see that $34 to $35 holds as support. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Coupa SoftwareThis one has had some strange moves lately, with Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) closing off the lows but ultimately lower by 3% on the day. Its earnings weren't able to break it out of the recent range, between $89 to $97. A close outside of this range likely creates a momentum trade in that direction.Meaning, a close below range support sends it lower and a close above could cause a breakout. Let's wait until we have a more definitive direction rather than guess on which way it will go. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Dick's Sporting GoodsDick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) is crumbling on Tuesday, down 11% after disappointing investors with its earnings report.While the 50-week moving average is stepping up as support (not shown on the daily chart above) at $34.58, this one is looking kind of ugly right here. The stock knifed right through all of its major daily moving averages and could have more downside left if the stock doesn't maintain Tuesday's lows. If the 61.8% Fibonacci doesn't supports the stock near $34, this one could sink to $32.50.On a rally, look to see whether DKS can push through its moving averages or if this level acts as resistance. For now, more downside is the risk. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: VisaMaking new 52-week highs on the day is Visa (NYSE:V). This silent winner was able to push over a key level at $150. Now bulls have to make sure it stays above this mark. A dip and hold to $150 is a great buying opportunity in this sense.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary Below this mark and uptrend support and/or the 21-day moving average becomes the next buy-the-dip spot. If it fails, $142 to $144 is likely. Just remember to keep it simple.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-13,"Last year was especially hard on the financial sector. It developed the reputation that the banks could sustain a rally. But one segment within the financials is hotter than ever and held up well even last year. Unlike traditional money centers, financial technology or &quot;fintech stocks&quot; like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and even old dogs like Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA) continue to rally through thick and thin. Wall Street is enamored with their business models, and this has benefitted PayPal stock.Source: Shutterstock In fact, PayPal stock is up 21% in the past 12 months; whereas, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF) is down 10% for the same period. The fastest and most expensive runner of the fintech bunch is Square (NYSE:SQ), which is up 35% year-to-date, but PYPL, V and MA are all strong regardless as each is up around 15% for the same period.Today, the story is about PayPal and how it should be a winning investment for the long term and offer short-term opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips How to Approach PayPal Stock TodayFor years, the global trend has been to transition finances to strictly online transactions. From regular shopping to global money flow, we demand our money to flow fast and worldwide. This was most evident during the Bitcoin craze of 2017. Although the value of the coin is debatable, everyone agrees that the blockchain technology behind it is attractive and encapsulates the concept.  * 10 Dividend Stock Winners Transactor companies like Paypal offer the blockchain concept of moving money fast and they are operational now. So they are best suited to sustain their success for years to come. Since the transition to electronic finance is in its infancy, there is enough business for all the current competitors to thrive.So PYPL stock is likely to do well for the long term, but the problem for investors is that it's a momentum stock. It moves fast in both directions and this presents a problem to many. On the way up it seems like it's ready to correct thereby forcing traders to miss out on the upside.Case in point, while Wall Street is still expecting a correction in stocks, PYPL stock is almost at its all-time highs. Clearly, the fintech bulls are used to the momentum aspect of this trade. The idea is to buy high and sell higher. Else we'd end up missing the whole trade.Fundamentally, Paypal stock is not cheap. It is almost twice as expensive as V and three times as expensive as American Express (NYSE:AXP). But for as long as it is growing fast, investors will give it a pass on that front.Younger companies need to over spend in order to catch up so it is more important that traders judge their top line performance and not the margins. At least PYPL is in the black whereas SQ still loses money.For those who want to own the shares for the long term, then, the actual timing is less important. If the stock market is rising, then PYPL will be higher later. But not every one wants to hold stocks for the long term and for those kinds of investors, there are short-term clues for more surgical entry and exit points. Bottom Line on PYPLFor the short term, PYPL is near its all-time highs, so buying it up here requires courage. But with proper stop loss levels, traders can do it provided they stick to their exit points well.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks That Deserve Your Attention in 2019 PayPal stock recently broke out of the $94 zone so that would be the best level of short-term support if the rally fades from the top. The closest support level, which usually is the weakest, is at $97. Below that, there are two similar supports at $96 and $95. So depending on personal preferences and risk tolerance, those would be the significant short-term levels to trade. This only applies to those in it for the short term. Longer term, it can fall to $88 per share and not change the bullish thesis much.In summary, Wall Street is attracted to financial tech because the transition into an electronic environment plays right into the hands of companies like PayPal. That means you can own it or trade it with confidence for years to come.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

The answer to this varies from one investor to another and depends mostly on time frames. How to Approach Visa Stock HereThose who want to invest in it and own the shares for the long term, the simple answer is that it's not too late to own it.

If the stock market is higher later, then so is Visa.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Bull Market's Anniversary For that purpose, even though V  stockis at all-time highs, it is not expensive. It's cheaper than MA and sells at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 34. While this is not dirt cheap, since it's almost double that of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it's not bloated either. So owning shares here for the long term is not likely to be a major financial debacle. There is not a lot of froth to lose so the downside risk should be limitedShort term, chasing a runaway stock like this at all-time highs is not ideal. It leaves the buyers' portfolios vulnerable to short-term dips. But then again, here the matter of intentions makes a difference.For those who are looking to trade Visa stock and not necessarily be in it for the long-term investment, then going long Visa stock here would be a tactical trade. The idea is to buy high and sell higher. But for that, we need precise levels to mark the stop loss points. Bottom Line on V StockTo understand the support levels we need to know how the rally up to here unfolded. V stock is now 25% off its December lows. But the breakout really started from $140 per share on Feb. 1 and after its earnings report. That level was a neckline with $146 per share as the target. So those are two major lines of support for the mid-term.More recently, a secondary pivot level developed around $145 per share. The bears tried to break on Mar. 8, but the bulls prevailed so that now becomes an important level to hold. If it fails in the near term, it would target support at $140.  * 7 Inexpensive, High-Dividend ETFs to Buy On the lower time frame charts, there is a shorter-term recent level of contention at $149.70. This served as the floor for the recent poke to new all-time highs. So by default, this becomes the first level of support and if fails, it should also be the stop loss trigger for momentum traders. This does not affect those who are in the stock for the long haul.There is also another micro support zone between $151 and $152 per share that is an even tighter stop loss levels for momentum traders. Where I stop myself out depends on my own level of risk tolerance.  Click to EnlargeThe first stop, however, remains in my overall thesis on Visa stock and my goals for the trade. I need to know if I am trying to trade it or invest in it. It is also important that if I am in it for a trade that I don't turn it into an investment.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-03-15,"Mastercard's (NYSE:MA) battle with long-time archrival Visa (NYSE:V) continues, with a win in the bidding for fintech firm Transfast. Coming in the wake of losing out in an effort to purchase a similar company, cross-border payments network provider Earthport, MA stock investors can be confident the payments processor is doing all it can to remain competitive.Both Mastercard and Visa have seen their stocks rise as the world moves to cashless economies. With the evolution to digital money, the entire payments industry continues to benefit from double-digit profit growth.At the same time, it makes a decision to invest in MA stock or V shares more than a simple buy-or-sell question. In this industry, investors should not ask if they should buy Mastercard stock; they should find out if it or one of its peers would bring more profit?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips MasterCard Keeps Up Yet Falls BehindWith MasterCard buying Transfast and Visa presumably winning the bidding war to acquire Earthport, both firms get better access to bank accounts and ACH networks globally. Perhaps more importantly, both card processors expand their presence in peer-to-peer money transactions.So, as the world more toward a cashless society, the MA-Visa rivalry gets more heated. In nearly all cases, most merchants accept both types of cards. Yes, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) only accepts Visa, but such exclusive instances are rare.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% However, despite this parity, Visa dominates in terms of gross dollar volume, which covers all types of transactions. As of the third quarter of 2018, Visa controlled 61.5% of the market. This compares to only 25.2% for MA, and 11.1% for American Express (NYSE:AXP). Mastercard Benefits From Fintech GrowthHowever, where Mastercard lags in credit cards, it has compensated with its moves into debit cards and e-commerce. Thankfully for Mastercard stock bulls, these areas will see the most near-term growth in the fintech space.The benefit -- and the problem -- with this fintech sector is that every equity in the industry would probably bring profits. Even Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS), which holds only 2.2% of the market, should see double-digit profit growth this year. One could make an argument that MA stock would deliver higher returns than Discover. However, whether it can outperform its other peers is the bigger question. Should I Buy MA Stock?The MA stock price hovers near its 52-week high of about $228 per share. Still, it struggles to stand out even as it posts stellar numbers. In both profit and valuation, Mastercard and Visa appear similar. Mastercard stock analysts forecast profit increases of 16.3% this year and 18.4% in 2020. This barely exceeds the 15.4% rate for 2019 and 15.8% 2020 growth predicted for Visa. Moreover, the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio slightly exceeds that of Visa, 25.5 vs. 24.8.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio I like Mastercard stock better now than last year when I panned it for its high multiple and lower profit growth. Achieving near parity with Visa has changed the value proposition. However, it has not made MA stock more of a bargain than Visa.Moreover, if we evaluate these stocks purely on valuation, both American Express and Discover trade at single-digit PE ratios. Both have grown profits more slowly than Mastercard. However, with American Express set to overtake Mastercard as the second-largest processor of credit cards, AXP stock could become the equity of choice in this space. Bottom Line on Mastercard StockAlthough Mastercard stock remains a buy, the fintech sector appears to offer better options. The purchase of Transfast should enhance Mastercard's ability to conduct transactions. However, it continues to struggle to differentiate itself from Visa even as Visa achieves increasing dominance with credit card transactions.MA stock will continue to benefit from double-digit profit growth for the foreseeable future. Also, even though its 25.5 PE ratio exceeds its peers, most analysts would not call Mastercard stock &quot;overpriced.&quot; Still, for investors who intend to pursue a higher return, they might see a larger profit by buying AXP stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-15,"Whatever else 2018 brought to the U.S., it was a Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) Christmas.Source: Shutterstock The wholesale warehouse club's U.S. sales rose 7.4% for the quarter ending in January, with same store sales up a full 6%.   * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs The result was net income of $889 million, $2.01 per share fully diluted, on revenue of $34.628 billion. Profits even exceeded membership fees of $768 million.Regular members noticed. The parking lot of my nearest Costco this past Christmas looked like a Trader Joe's, and I had to go to another one. Investors were even bigger winners. The shares had hit a mid-December low of $194.50, but opened for trade March 12 at over $229 and are approaching last year's record high of $241.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Most Valuable RetailerAt its current price, Costco has a market cap of $101 billion, a price-to-earnings multiple over 29, and is worth 72% of its sales.Compare Costco's valuation to that of Walmart (NYSE:WMT), analysts' previous favorite. That company has a market cap that is 55% of sales, and its dividend of $2.12 per year yields 2.18%, while Costco's $2.28 per share represents a yield of just 1.05%.The only thing overpriced at Costco is Costco. No one has named their dog after it, but they're getting close. Costco caters to upper-middle class, suburban tastes. Its stores feature the finest wines, prime meats, extra virgin olive oil and store brand liquor that's equal to the best name brands. Its arrangement with Citigroup (NYSE:C) to handle Visa (NYSE:V) cards has proven profitable for both the company and its members (we're taking a weekend vacation on our dividend). Its growth rate in e-commerce is 24%. Within its niche, Costco is even more popular than Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Small wonder that, even at its current price, 12 of 27 analysts following the stock say buy it and none says sell.Costco does this while paying what workers consider reasonable salaries, with cashiers making almost half the salary of store managers.  The company recently hiked its minimum wage to $15 per hour.When you go there, people smile. How Long, How HighThe problem is that when you buy a stock you're paying for its yesterdays and buying its tomorrows. The price of Costco stock today is close to the price targets of Costco bulls.Costco is not growing as fast internationally as it is in the U.S., and it is starting to saturate the U.S. market, where it has 535 of its 770 warehouses. It can cost $100 million to build and outfit a new store, and the company is very careful to get the very best deals on them. Rumors of possible new store openings are big news, and when the company walks away there is often profound disappointment. Costco bears are left wishing and hoping that scan-and-go shopping, in which customers scan the items they want and get them delivered, mobile payments with installment financing, or warehouse fulfillment will deliver Costco's savings with greater convenience.  Trouble is, Costco is already doing some of these things. The Bottom Line on Costco StockCostco is running on all cylinders. It's not doing a thing wrong. Customers and analysts know this.This means Costco is a pricey stock. It can't make you rich because everyone is already in it. Its growth may be limited because it has already scaled.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Today But if anyone knows the future of upper-class consumption, it's Costco. I wouldn't bet against it. You may just want to wait for another market crash like last December's to buy it.A Costco shopper is always looking for bargains.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-20,"Insurance data company Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) has been evolving and increasingly, Ebix stock has started a slow march up. It's a pleasant surprise as I first ran into this company almost a decade ago, when I was still at ZDNet.At the time they were buying a health care information company called A.D.A.M., for $66 million. I recently found my story on the Ebix Web site.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince then, Ebix has ridden a lot of ups and downs. The stock traded as low as $9.26 per share in 2012. But it found its footing and rose to as much as $83 per share last year. It opens for trade March 12 at about $51.30 per share.Ebix is worth looking at again because it's no longer the company it was. It's a broader company, with interests in insurance as well as health care. It is also much more focused on India, which is where  CEO Robin Raina hails from.That's the real story.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them  Payment Innovation and Ebix StockTransaction processing has long been an American lake, dominated by Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and their networks of processing partners, many of which have operations in Atlanta, where Ebix is based in the suburban town of John's Creek.But India's government recently pushed through a powerful transaction processing innovation, a Unified Payments Interface that has made India the innovation center of the global payments industry.Not only did India create a low-cost payment infrastructure, it also pushed people to use it, banning high-denomination bills to fight tax evasion and pushing commerce into the new system.The rise of low-cost digital payments has boosted Alibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ:BABA), Tencent Holding (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) and even American companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), all of which have taken advantage of the new infrastructure, at the expense of banks and traditional processors.This is what Ebix is tapping into. India Moves and Ebix StockEbix' market cap is barely $1.5 billion, but U.S. dollars go a long way in India.The company has made 11 deals in India in just 14 months, all in various areas of ecommerce infrastructure. The purchases cost about $500 million. Raina wants to invest another $500 million this year, and take what had been the remittance system ItzCash, now renamed EbixCash, public.Raina's latest deal, announced March 11, is a proposal to buy Yatra Online (NASDAQ:YTRA), the ticketing firm behind Yatra.com, an Indian rival to Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) or Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG).The company had already bought 80% of Zillious, another online travel booker. The plan is to make Yatra part of EbixCash, then take the whole thing public.On March 1, Ebix announced its revenue for 2018 was up 37% to $497.8 million and a few days later it announced plans to be at a run rate of $750 million by the end of this year. The country's footprint in India is large enough for it to sponsor one of the country's leading business conferences and host the country's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. The Bottom Line on Ebix StockIndia is one of the world's fastest growing economies, and electronic transactions, thanks to government help, are one of the fastest-growing parts of that economy.Ebix has transformed itself, in barely a year, from a small American company focused on health payments into a real competitor inside this enormous opportunity.It has taken real risks to do this, with long-term debt of $274 million and a revolving line of credit worth another $424 million.  Its operating cash flow, $89.8 million last year, can hardly keep up.Ebix is all-in on India and has made itself a speculative stock in the process. But speculating on Ebix stock is worthwhile, and if you want that kind of international exposure, here it is.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-25,"Major U.S. indices are down slightly on Monday, as investors still mull over the development of a potential slowing global economy. That's left some stocks to do well on the day and others to drag their feet. Let's look at our top stock trades for Tuesday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: AppleLet's look at the big name of the day, and that's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its slew of Services announcements. $195 is now acting as a roadblock to Apple stock and the 200-day moving average isn't holding up as support.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe name could remain volatile over the next session or two following this announcement, but for now it looks like shares are set to pullback. That's important, as it helps unwind the overbought condition that Apple has been carrying for the last week or so.  * 7 Dual-Class Stocks That Will Outperform So what now? Look to see if $185 -- the prior gap level from November -- holds as support. Just below, near $182 is the 20-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Below these levels and the $175 mark is on the table, where Apple posted its big breakout from earlier this month. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: RokuAt one point, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) was up more than 6% on Monday while its CEO was at the Apple event. Shares have since cooled somewhat, but are still up 4% on the day after Apple said its Apple TV app would work with Roku.The stock is well off its session highs, but is still holding up over the 20-day moving average. That's important for bulls, particularly as the overall market remains under pressure. However, momentum is susceptible to fading here and if it does, we could see ROKU stock back near $60.If that's the case, see how this level holds up as support. Should shares continue higher, see if they can fill the gap back up to $71. If it can, Roku may test its all-time highs. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: TeslaA big downgrade from RBC sunk shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Monday, as the downward pressure continues. However, the stock is finally down in that buyers' support zone we've talked about before.Down into this $250 to $260 zone, investors can take a limit-risk shot on the long side knowing that a close below this area would be their exit. On a rally, investors can use three upside targets: short-term downtrend resistance (black line), the 20-day moving average and medium-term downtrend resistance (blue line)/the 50-day moving average.   Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: NikeWe recently covered Nike (NYSE:NKE) thanks to earnings, but the company's name is back in the news on Monday after lawyer Michael Avenatti was arrested on extortion attempts against the athletic apparel maker.Shares rallied higher on Monday but failed at the 50-day moving average before turning lower. Given that this level failed to buoy Nike meant the 200-day moving average was on the table.Let's see if we can get a pullback into this $78 to $80 area and if so, we can take a calculated shot on the long side. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: VisaVisa (NYSE:V) is also a name we've liked on the long side, and we're finally getting the setup that we like.After pushing through $150 and stalling at $155, V stock is starting to pullback. Aggressive bulls can initiate a position, preferably near $152, with a limited-risk setup.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Play the CBD Trend Below $150 and V will lose the 20-day moving average, breakout support (black line) and uptrend support (blue line). Should it hold, look for $155 or higher, although Visa may need the broader market's cooperation.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-28,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips When it comes to widely distributed credit cards only two names come to mind Visa NYSE V and Mastercard NYSE MA While not attacking other rivals in the sector these two have long,Don’t Let the Gimmicky Apple Card Turn You Away From Visa Stock
2019-03-28,"When it comes to widely-distributed credit cards, only two names come to mind: Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). While not attacking other rivals in the sector, these two have long battled for nominal supremacy. As a result, it's not surprising to see Visa stock respond positively over the years.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrFor decades, the Visa slogan was &quot;It's everywhere you want to be.&quot; And with 323 million cardholders, that message clearly resonated with consumers worldwide. For starters, subscriber count notably exceeds Mastercard at 191 million cardholders. Most critically, over eight million merchants accept Visa, invariably bolstering the V stock price.That sentiment has held true this year as well. On a year-to-date basis, V stock is up nearly 20%, contradicting worries of a global economic slowdown. However, an unlikely competitor has now entered the fray.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos  Visa Has a New RivalAt the start of this week, consumer-technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched their product showcase. Celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and even Big Bird made appearances, talking up all things Apple.Of particular interest to Visa's management team, as well as Visa stakeholders, is the Apple Card. Working in conjunction with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as the bank issuer and Mastercard for payment processing, Apple marketed their new credit card as a product for the masses. It will feature zero fees, a simple interface, and of course, synergistic compatibility with the iPhone and other i-devices.On paper, the new Apple Card threatens Visa in a number of core areas. Primarily, the tech firm aims to disrupt Visa's market share through selling points that appeal to the broader public. While AAPL didn't dive into details regarding interest rates, they implied that they'll accept a wide range of credit scores.Clearly, they're not attempting to compete with the American Express (NYSE:AXP) Centurion Card, which is invitation only. And with Apple's partnership with Mastercard, it's obvious that their focus is on Visa and indirectly, the V stock price.Secondly, almost a billion people actively use their iPhones. Thus, even if Apple stays exclusively within their ecosystem for their credit card, this is still a massive ecosystem. Furthermore, iPhone users are more likely to own other Apple products, enhancing engagement.Finally, iPhone app users have a much higher income than their Android-based counterparts. We're talking an average salary of $85,000 compared to $61,000. Therefore, Apple doesn't necessarily have to win the nominal game in order to win big. Naturally, this concerns folks who are heavily vested in Visa stock. More Hype Than SubstanceAt the same time, I wouldn't get overly worried. Yes, the Apple Card does have some strong attributes. However, we should also consider this latest product's vulnerabilities.First, AAPL has found itself in an awkward position: running low on good ideas, and falling behind on others. Despite substantial efforts, the company's revenues are heavily leveraged towards iPhone sales. Without the iconic smartphone, it's a pretty generic organization.That last statement sounds inflammatory until you consider that names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) have taken the lead in products like smart speakers. They're also venturing out into viable growth channels like cloud computing and even video games.On the other hand, Apple has a credit card. It's neat and trendy, but it's still a credit card, something that's been around for ages. Since Visa is the top dog in this arena, I doubt the debutant will hurt Visa stock.Second, for all practical intents and purposes, the Apple Card is yet another Apple product. Translation: it's probably not going to work well outside the company's ecosystem. As I mentioned earlier, AAPL levers an enviable network. However, to win the credit card wars, you need the numbers.Sure, most iPhone users are rich. However, a great many are just average income-earners. Invariably with credit cards, you're going to create a different experience for customers based solely on their finances. If you think about it, this sounds awfully discriminatory and is a bad optic for a popular retail-goods manufacturer. This does, however, benefit Visa stock through a PR perspective.Third, and most important, the Apple Card doesn't offer a compelling reason to join up. Even partner Goldman Sachs politely said the same thing. Gimmicks Won't Take down Visa StockIf you worried about Apple's disruption into your holdings of Visa, don't. As their own unbalanced product sales demonstrate, Apple can't even disrupt themselves.Moreover, jumping into credit cards is no easy task, even for a former trillion-dollar company. Not only do competitors require massive resources, they also need networks and a cohesive marketing plan. Apple only has one of these attributes, which subsequently lifts V stock by default.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-02,"Two years ago, when everyone was hyped about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, people like me were writing, &quot;This is nothing, wait until we get to blockchain.&quot;Blockchain, an encrypted, shared, database, built with open source software and organized as a general ledger, was the revolution. Everyone would be able to see the ledger, but encryption would keep transaction details secret, allowing security.This would change everything.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNow it's 2019 and these kinds of mass market applications are starting to appear.One of the most hyped is QLC Chain. Its software or Mainnet is now available at popular open source repositories. The network is due to go live on May 28 when its Q-gas tokens begin distribution inside the network. Financial Transactions Via SMSQLC Chain is a short message service (SMS) billing and clearing system. Its lead sponsor is Montnets Group, a Chinese company that operates IM Cloud, an instant messaging service.The twist is that QLC Chain lets SMS messages, which could come from simple software applications, carry financial transactions. Anyone who participates in the chain gets to share in its low costs. Montnets' customers include all the leading players in China's internet, as well as its mobile operators.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business The chain claims to offer distributed security, distributed billing and peer to peer addressing built on IPv6. Transactions are automatically encrypted, so settlements are instantaneous. Members of the chain will be able to verify the IPv6 address of every transaction message, which they can use to ensure senders are credible.The hope/expectation is this will create profitability in transactions between software applications and their users, building an infrastructure in which money can move instantly, without cost. SMS billing has long been troubled by things like spamming, phishing, and other types of fraud. Despite this, it was a $62 billion market in 2017. What Can Go Wrong?As with all blockchain networks, it's tokenizing money -- turning currency into bits and back into money -- that is the key.Trading QLC Chain tokens has already begun on major crypto exchanges. Its rise is noteworthy, in a world where other cryptocurrencies are stuck in low, narrow trading ranges.The more money that goes into applications supporting blockchain, tokens that can be exchanged for one another before they pop back in someone's pocket as &quot;fiat&quot; currency, the more valuable the whole space becomes.But there's a contradiction. If something is increasingly valuable, speculators are going to dominate the market. But if cryptocoins are subject to speculation, their values become unstable, making their blockchains less useful as sources of transactions.Thus, blockchain advocates now want their technology to become invisible, the way Visa (NYSE:V) transaction processing is invisible.  * The Elite 8 Stocks to Buy for Massive Outperformance Despite this, the hype train must run in order to get companies into the technology. The hype machine is currently focused on 5G, the fast, ubiquitous cellular technology now being rolled out by carriers. That's because 5G is due to be embedded in anything with intelligent sensors -- homes, cars, utility meters, even traffic lights. Combine the security of blockchain with the ubiquity of 5G, the hype goes, and anything can become a metered service. The Bottom LineThe main benefit of blockchain is lower transaction costs. This would enable the kind of micro-transactions that might let you pay for, say, reading this story as a service, for the portions of a penny it's worth, and have most of that money flow to InvestorPlace, or even to me.That's why banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and service providers like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are hiring blockchain programmers as fast as they can.If this is going to change everything, you don't want to be left out.

2019-04-03,"Despite the recent rallies in the market, the media rhetoric continues to be filled with a bearish tone. Everyone is expecting this party to end badly even though there is no evidence of impending doom. We hear it ten times a day: 'we've come so far so fast.' So using this logic, we should up our car insurance policy or stop driving if we haven't wrecked in a while.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) Sure we have a flattening yield curve but that is not reason to sell stocks of great companies who are still set up for success. Square (NYSE:SQ) is one that still deserve some attention even here near all-time highs. SQ belongs to a group of financial stocks that I call the transactors. So it competes with behemoths like Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and it is holding its own. SQ is the relatively new kid on the block -- a new kid who is kicking ass and taking names. The Demand for SQ Services Is Getting StrongerYear to date, Square stock is up 35% which is more than double that of the S&P 500 and three times more than the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF). Clearly investors like what they see from the company. The advent of blockchain and even the bitcoin craze contributed to the popularity of these transactor companies.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut this is not just hype. The need for SQ services is real. The globe is migrating its banking to electronic format. Like everything else nowadays, we want our money fast and cheap and SQ helps get that done.This is a trend that is not going to reverse, so the future is bright for as long as the financial world doesn't collapse.Even though, relatively speaking, the company is young, management has so far proven itself competent. So I consider buying Square stock a viable long-term investment. I am confident that if the stock market in general is higher, then so is SQ.Fundamentally, critics argue that Square's value is too rich and they'd be right. But in this case, SQ is still a growth company so I don't worry so much about its margins. They are suppose to spend a lot to grow. Later, when they start to mature, I'd worry about increasing profitability. This is true for any growth stock I analyze. Trading SQ StockFor those who prefer to trade short term, SQ presents a challenge. This is a momentum stock so it moves fast in both directions. This makes it impossible to spot clear entry and exit points.But in this case there are some important technical clues we can decipher from the charts. The range for SQ stock has recently tightened. In the past year, it's touched both $100 and $50 per share and now it sits exactly in the middle. This builds up energy in the chart that needs to explode, which usually forebodes a big move to release the built up tension in the price.Since we don't know about the direction of the move we then find the important lines to watch here. My hunch is that it will be a rally since the bulls are still in charge of this market and SQ has no specific reason to fall on its own. So if I were to place a bet, I'd say SQ will be breaking it out soon.Towards that, the next three levels to watch are $76.75, $79.25 and $82.90. Each is a mini-breakout level that would bring the next one into its target zone. So depending on my time frame I'd pick one of them to chase SQ stock. If it moves above it then I'd expect it to invite more momentum buyers into it.Of the three, the $83 zone is the most significant. It was where SQ failed worst late February and November so clearly neither bulls nor bears will let it go without a fight. And on the way up, this creates congestion which is resistance to the rally. But if the bulls prevail then they overshoot $10 higher.But since we are still in geopolitical headline mode then I'd have to set stop losses. SQ needs to hold $71.50 else it would trigger an opposite and bearish pattern that would invite momentum sellers.Regardless of the short-term risks, there are opportunities in owning SQ stock for the long term more so than shorting it. If the concept of buying into high valuation is insurmountable then I should at least invest in either Visa or MasterCard because the sector is worth the risk.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-07,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has dramatically underperformed over the past six months. AAPL stock is still down nearly 20% from its recent peak, whereas the stock market as a whole is approaching new all-time highs. And tech stocks, in general, have led the 2019 rebound, leaving Apple in the dust.Source: Apple It's not hard to see why. In January, Apple shocked the world with a sales warning. That was the first time Apple issued a sales warning since way back in 2002. Now, to be fair, this isn't the first time that Apple has had a soft hardware cycle.Apple's revenues turned negative year over year in both 2013 and 2016 during the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6s cycles.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, this is arguably the worst hardware sales period for Apple within the iPhone age, given the revenue warning. And investors have been slow to forgive AAPL stock.  * 7 A-Rated Healthcare Stocks for Industry Expansion For one thing, CFO Luca Maestri said just months earlier that Apple was anticipating its strongest holiday line-up and sales yet. So to miss on sales by billions of dollars for the quarter came as quite the blow. Not surprisingly, Apple is refocusing investor attention elsewhere with its new push. Apple's Hardware Sales Are Reaching LimitsOn various occasions, I've suggested that Apple has been an anomaly in that it can make serious money on hardware. In general, tech companies that make big profits in hardware tend to lose strength quickly. It's simply too easy for competitors to make similar products at lower prices. For every Apple that dominates a field for ages, you have a Nokia or Blackberry (NYSE:BB) that has a few peak years and then fades to irrelevancy.However, it's starting to look like even Apple is running into limits in terms of how much profits it can wring out of hardware. The addressable share of the market for high-end smartphones is only so large. Particularly in emerging markets, most people will buy cheaper options from the likes of Samsung or Huawei. And even on iPhone pricing, there appears to be a ceiling where some people say enough is enough.Throw in how powerful the average iPhone is now, and users feel less compelled to upgrade with every new product launch. In general, there simply isn't a must-have feature with each new model that drives upgrades if users' previous phone is still working and holds a good charge. Apple Turns to ServicesLast week, Apple announced a ton of new and improved service offerings. Arguably the most interesting and important of these was the news of an Apple Card to take on the likes of Visa (NYSE:V). Partnering with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) for payment processing, the Apple Card could theoretically be a serious rival to Visa. That wasn't it for announcements though. Apple is also rolling out an improved version of Apple TV, an Apple News feature, and an Apple Arcade gaming service.In theory, these could all be interesting additions for Apple that could add significant revenue streams. Apple News, for example, by offering a subscription service for journalism could help that industry turn its fortunes around in the digital age, as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) did for music. It's unlikely to generate big revenues for Apple at least in the near term though. Same for the arcade, which may shift revenues from in app purchases to subscription but is unlikely to make the overall pie much bigger, at least in the short run.And for the bigger announcements, there are serious questions about both. Apple TV+ seems too small to be a serious Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) challenger. If Apple spends $1 billion a year on original content, that's something, but it's only a drop in the bucket compared to Netflix's $8 billion budget, to say nothing of Disney (NYSE:DIS) and other traditional content creators. And over in credit cards, our Josh Enomoto described how Apple's card is a &quot;gimmicky&quot; offering which brings more &quot;hype than substance&quot;. For now, Apple has a lot left to prove with its new services offerings. AAPL Stock VerdictCompared to other tech stocks, AAPL stock looks attractive by comparison. Assuming the market continues moving to new all-time highs, it's not hard to imagine AAPL stock playing catch-up and moving back toward its own previous high at $233/share.In the longer-run, however, I remain an Apple skeptic. The company has largely tapped the growth potential of its major developed markets. People who are going to buy Apple smartphones are already doing so - where's the new marginal consumer that hasn't bought Apple products yet?Meanwhile, in emerging markets, Apple faces a huge challenge. They don't have the same sort of lock-in that they do on consumers in developed markets. In China in particular, which was supposed to be Apple's next big thing, sales are instead going the other direction. That's because WeChat, which runs on all smartphones, is the key must-have application, rather than Apple OS. Chinese consumers are increasingly happy to use other smartphone makers, as Apple OS and its associated ecosystem isn't a primary selling point that makes customers loyal.Overall, Apple's move to services is probably a smart play. Recurring revenue is a great business model, and Wall Street will bid your stock up as you get more of it. In certain markets, such as the U.S., Apple services will probably deliver major growth. As we've seen overseas, however, with something like Apple Music versus Spotify, Apple's brand matters much less in emerging markets. And as such, Apple services probably won't be enough, at least on its own, to make up for stagnating hardware sales.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned GS stock and had no positions in any of the other aforementioned securities.

2019-04-10,"Visa (NYSE:V), stock is up more than 30% over the past year, stoked, in part, by Federal Reserve rate hikes that have translated into higher profit margins for credit card companies. The overall fundamental strength of the company has also been the catalyst behind the V stock returns.The world's largest retail electronic payments network, Visa, is expected to report earnings on Apr. 24. There could be some volatility and profit-taking in V stock in April, especially as many other financial services firms also report in the coming weeks. However, I'd encourage long-term investors who would like exposure to the sector to regard any dip in the share price as an opportunity to add Visa stock to their portfolio. Long-Term V Stock StrengthsRobust Fundamental Numbers:  Visa is a quality blue-chip company with a $345 billion market cap. The group does not issue credit cards or lend money. Instead, the company operates as an &quot;intermediary,&quot; charging a fee on each of the 150 million transactions its network handles every day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVisa has three sources of revenue:  * Service revenues (for services provided to card issuers for the use of Visa products);  * Data processing revenues (fees Visa collects for the authorization, settlement, or clearing); and,  * International transaction revenues (for cross-border and currency conversion transactions).Visa's revenue for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2018 was $5.51 billion, a 13.25% increase year-over-year. The company saw double-digit growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions for Q4 and full-year.As one of the major credit and debit card processors, Visa has strong pricing power and a good profit margin that stands at almost 55%. Visa's leadership position in the industry requires financial flexibility so that the management can continue the growth-centric steps. Its current ratio, which measures Visa's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its current assets, is a healthy 1.65.Wall Street expects Visa's profitability and robust financial metrics to continue in the coming quarters, too -- a fact that should bring higher prices for V stock.Mobile Payments Space: Many of us have already paid for something with our smartphones at least once as mobile payments are fast becoming a convenient and swift method to pay bills or make transfers. Analysts expect the global market to reach $4.5 trillion by 2023.The most widely used transaction methods include contactless payments without entering the credit card PIN number at the point-of-sale or using a smartphone to pay a merchant or even a person such as a friend or family member, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards If you are looking at ways to benefit from this trend, Visa may be a solid company to consider. It's been boosting its mobile payment offerings. As early as 2011, the group took a stake in Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based credit card processing fintech, which was founded in 2009. There are rumors that Visa may end up acquiring Square.Its other strategic investments include Stripe and Marqeta. It's currently bidding to buy Earthport, a British payments company.Over the past decade, smartphones have become a part of our daily lives and it would not be wrong to expect mobile payments to enter our daily lives in a big way. In other words, as more consumers tap to pay or download an app to transfer money, Visa investors are likely to reap the rewards. What Could Derail Visa Stock?Short-term Technical Analysis and Price Charts: Year-to-date, Visa is up 19%. So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking in V stock. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Visa's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;In April and May, Visa stock could trade sideways for several weeks, and even have a pullback toward the low-$140's or even mid-$130's level, where the stock is likely to find major support.Visa stock's beta is 0.99, which means its volatility on average mimics that of the broader market. Therefore if the industry or the broader market declines as the companies release earnings, V stock price may also be adversely affected.If you already own Visa shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find Visa stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $185.Competition in the Mobile Payment Payments Space: The fintech revolution is evolving and the entire payments industry is growing fast. In addition to Visa, several other U.S. companies are leading the mobile-payment race that requires cutting-edge technology. In October 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced Apple Pay which has now become one of the dominant digital payment apps in the U.S.In the P2P space, investors love PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which owns the popular Venmo app. The app has over 25 million users and is ahead of its closest competitors -- Apple's Pay Cash, Square's Cash App, and Zelle, which is owned by Early Warning Services, a private fintech company.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off If there are other strong earnings reports or news from Visa's competitors hit the wires, there may be short-term volatility or decline in V stock price. However, Visa is a solid company with continued growth prospects in mobile payments. Therefore small price dips on daily headlines should not keep long-term investors up at night. Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further growth prospects, leadership in the respective market, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.Investors who are interested in financial services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Visa may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have Visa as a holding, including iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG), ISE Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY), or Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-15,"Since the company's initial public offering, Square (NYSE:SQ) blitzkrieged its way to the top of the markets. While shares have come down substantially from its peak, it's still a winner by almost any measure. For example, on a year-to-date basis, Square stock has gained a very impressive 38%.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)I first came across Square's payment-processing device at an auto-repair shop. My car's windshield suffered a severe-enough crack that required replacement. Once the work was done, I pulled out my credit card. The shop's owner took out his Square-armed smartphone and swiped my card. At that moment, I should have invested in Square stock.Of course, the key to the tech firm's success is disruption. What I recognized on the day my windshield died was that independent companies can finally compete with the big boys. Prior to Square and its innovative device, small-business owners had to invest in clunky machines tied to often-unfavorable contracts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith Square came capacity and freedom. It was a simple idea with a small touch, but it worked. The payment-processing device leveled the playing field, essentially forcing businesses to compete on product and service quality, not resource advantages. That alone is enough for most people to consider buying Square stock.  * 7 Marijuana Companies: Which Pot Stocks Should You Buy? Another reason is the growth of small business in America. Last year, this segment employed nearly 48% of the private-sector workforce. Even more impressive, small businesses number over 30 million.However, not everything surrounding SQ stock is bullish; namely, the share price. While SQ has skyrocketed since the start of the year, it's gone flat since mid-February. That worries folks because it appears the tech firm can go either way.Does Square stock have another catalyst to run on? Square Stock to Ride Disruption Narrative 2.0It turns out, SQ has another long-term story that can shake shares out of its present funk. In the first go-around, the company completely overturned the payment-processing sector. Now, management is turning its attention toward the payment platform itself.Earlier this year, Square announced that it would launch a new debit card aimed at small businesses. While the concept is hardly novel, this particular variation offers unique benefits.For instance, the Square card allows business owners to immediately spend the funds that they earn through their company's sales. This way, owners don't have to wait until the revenues hit their bank accounts, thereby improving cash flow.Another intriguing factor boosting prospects for the card and SQ stock is the purchase discount. If a card-holder elects to do business with fellow Square merchants, he or she will receive a 2.75% discount. That's a sizable benefit, especially compared to traditional charge cards' miserly offerings.In turn, KeyBanc analyst Josh Beck reiterated his &quot;overweight&quot; rating, as well as his $100 target for Square stock. But Beck also noted that Square's debit card will perform better than most people expect. I completely agree with him.Beck addresses the broader narrative, pointing out that roughly 40% of small businesses don't have a business-specific charge card. In other words, this is a grossly-underserved market that SQ can penetrate and later dominate.But what I view as critically important are the nuanced benefits. For instance, the Square card allows users to easily separate business and personal expenses. That might not seem like a big deal until tax season. Then, it can really save much frustration.I suspect that word-of-mouth of all platforms can drive home the conveniences of the Square card. This should eventually translate to a higher price for SQ stock. Demographics and SQ StockIf that doesn't convince you that Square stock is likely to move higher, consider demographic behaviors. Millennials don't just represent the largest workforce in the U.S. Increasingly, they've proven to the most entrepreneurial-minded.According to one survey, 66% of young Americans aspire to start their own businesses. Not only that, this trend crosses international borders. Oxford University released data that showed that the number of entrepreneurial-focused students increased significantly in recent years.Naturally, this rising trend bolsters the long-term case for Square stock. But it goes beyond that. You see, Square doesn't just provide tools in the way that Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA) does. Instead, it provides simple but effective platforms that encourage business growth.Again, you might think on the surface that differentiating personal and business expenses is a minor concept. And actually, you'd be right. However, it also mitigates one of the most cumbersome administrative tasks associated with owning a business. That's the type of smart thinking that separates SQ stock from the rest.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-16,"It seems overly anxious to argue that American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock needs big first-quarter results. After all, American Express stock is doing just fine, even if it's been quiet.Source: Shutterstock AXP stock did dip sharply in December, but it's recovered those losses. Over the last year, American Express stock has gained nearly 17%, and it has more than doubled in the last three-plus years.  * 7 Dental Stocks to Buy That Will Make You Smile Still, AXP earnings, due to be reported on Thursday morning, do look reasonably important. The outlook of AXP stock still seems somewhat skeptical, if not outright bearish. Investors are worried about its growth and market share. Its Q4 earnings were disappointing, but the market quickly moved on and kept pushing American Express stock higher. Investors may not be so forgiving if AXP earnings are disappointing again on Thursday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAXP stock has twice failed to break through resistance at about $113, and the average Street price target for American Express stock of $118 suggests an increase of  just 6% from its current level.A &quot;beat and raise&quot; Q1 would likely cause analysts to raise their price targets on AXP stock, leaving AXP well-positioned to reach new highs. If AXP earnings miss expectations, however,  investors may have concerns  about AXP's growth, causing American Express stock to at best trade sideways, as it has for nearly seven months now.As a result, Thursday's earnings do seem to be important for American Express stock,  and investors should review them closely. Expectations for AXP EarningsWall Street is expecting a moderately slow start to the year for American Express. Analysts' consensus revenue estimate projects just 7.6%  year-over-year, top-line growth, below the company's full-year guidance of 8%-10%. The company's margins are expected to be pretty much flat, and analysts on average expect its earnings per share to come in at $1.98, up 6.5% year-over-year.That, too suggests improvement over the rest of the year. Consensus for 2019 as a whole is modestly above the midpoint of the company's guidance, and projects 11% EPS growth.That's good news for AXP stock. AXP is not exactly in a &quot;no-lose&quot; situation, but analysts already expect its growth to accelerate as the year goes on. An in-line quarter, or even a modest miss, won't necessarily endanger that outlook.On the other hand, if AXP results solidly beat expectations, its outlook may get more interesting.  Under that scenario, American Express will have started the year strongly, and will still have the same room for improvement during the rest of the year. Full-year growth estimates may well get raised, and the earnings multiple assigned to American Express stock can also rise. If that occurs, AXP  can reach new highs. AXP Stock and the Post-Earnings CallThat said, the numbers aren't going to be the only aspect of the release to which investors will pay close attention. American Express re-upped its partnership with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) earlier this month. That was a big win for AmEx, which already had lost co-branding agreements with Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU).But American Express had to pay up for the win. It was Delta stock that soared on the news, given that its payments from the deal will double in five years. The end results of that negotiation certainly suggests that American Express' edge over rivals Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) has narrowed.So investors will have concerns about AXP's cost and market share  Visa and Mastercard simply are growing faster than AmEx. And the main concern about American Express - and the reason AXP stock is so much cheaper than V and MA - is that at some point, its earnings simply are going to stall out. The entrance of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) into the space only adds to those worries.There likely will be some questions about the Delta deal  and the kind of returns American Express expects on the resulting $3 billion-plus increase in annual spending. Analysts will want management's take on the Apple Card as well. AmEx needs to answer those questions well, and it needs to convince analysts and investors that its place in the credit-card industry is secure. Be Careful With American Express StockAll told, AXP's Q1 results do seem  poised to change the outlook of AXP stock. A beat-and-raise quarter will suggest that AXP's growth remains intact, making the 12.4  forward, price-earnings multiple of AXP stock seem awfully cheap. Any weakness - whether in the company's results or its guidance - will cause investors to ask if fears about AXP's growth are reasonable.That doesn't mean AXP stock is going to move 10% or more on Thursday; AXP simply isn't that type of stock. Rather, AXP's Q1 earnings could shape how American Express stock trades over the next two months  and determine whether AXP stock can finally break through resistance.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Moreover, a well-funded competitor has entered the credit-card business. Those developments could cause some owners of V stock to question its rising price-earnings multiple.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Although those issues don't pose an immediate threat to Visa's dominance, they could make investors think twice about buying Visa stock at its current levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Visa Should Beat Analysts' Estimates, But Is That Enough?For the second quarter, analysts on average expects Visa's  earnings per share to come in at $1.24. If Visa hits that target, its EPS will have risen 11.7% year-over-year. Analysts' consensus revenue estimate is $5.46 billion, versus the $5.07 billion of revenue that the company reported  in the same quarter of 2018.Since V has exceeded analysts' consensus earnings expectations in each of the previous four quarters, its Q2 results will probably beat the consensus outlook as well. As our society continues to increasingly give up cash, Visa and its peers should continue to benefit from that trend.Furthermore, Visa continues to gain market share from archrival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) as well as peers such as American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS). As late as the third quarter of last year, Visa claimed more than 61% of total U.S. card volume. That makes Visa stock a compelling long-term buy on any pullback, even if the company's Q2 results are surprisingly negative.However, I see signs that the short-term outlook of Visa is not entirely positive. The price-earnings  ratio of Visa stock now stands at around 34.5. That comes in slightly ahead of the long-term average multiple of V stock, which is about 32.6. Since Visa's profit is expected to increase 15.2% this year, I think Visa stock price is mildly overvalued.Meanwhile, V stock looks less than compelling when investors can buy AXP stock at about 14 times its earnings. By buying AXP, whose profits are expected to rise 11% this year,  traders obtain about 72% of the growth of Visa at around 40% of the price. Visa Stock Faces Rising ThreatsAlso, Visa has used its dominant position to raise the fees that it charges merchants. That has prompted Kroger (NYSE:KR) to refuse to accept Visa cards at some of its locations. For now, Kroger is only refusing to accept Visa's credit cards at 21 of its Foods Co. stores in California. However, it will soon extend this ban to both its Smith's Food and Drug stores and its fuel centers in seven states.That places V in an awkward position. If Kroger stops accepting Visa at all of its stores or if other retailers start refusing to accept Visa cards at some of their stores, Visa's revenues could meaningfully drop. However, if Visa relents and lowers its fees, that will likely reduce its profits, negatively impacting  Visa stock.Moreover, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has partnered with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Mastercard on its new Apple Card. At first glance, the card provides some benefits, such as faster cash-back rewards and enhanced security, since it does not use numbers.Still, it appears that the card will limit most of those benefits to consumers who are already using Apple's iOS ecosystem. For that reason, I would not expect the Apple Card to supplant Visa's dominant position. However, Apple Card could take market share from Visa, negatively impacting the Visa stock price. Concluding Thoughts on Visa StockAlthough Visa will more than likely post higher-than-expected earnings and revenue, emerging competitive threats could create doubts about Visa stock.Meanwhile, the valuations of Visa stock have begun to climb above their long-term averages. Also, Visa's rising fees have started to prompt merchants to push their customers to other cards. Furthermore, the Apple Card  will give consumers another reason to avoid Visa.Despite the new threats, Visa stock should continue to benefit from double-digit profit growth. However, retailers and customers will take advantage of  the lower fees of Visa's peers. Also, traders can invest in a credit-card network at a much lower multiple by buying AXP stock.As a result, the driving force of Visa stock could be the rising threats of better alternatives for multiple players. That does not mean investors should sell Visa stock. But investors still need to account for those dangers when they're considering buying V stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-18,"Although this year the stock market sentiment is in a much better state, the banks still have their reputation that they cannot hold their rallies. But therein lies part of the opportunity in American Express (NYSE:AXP) stock today.Source:  Marcus Quigmire Via FlickrThis round of bank earnings has so far gone much better than the last one. There is some chatter about a sustainable rally in their stocks. On Tuesday we even saw a flip from red to green in stocks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).This hasn't happened in a while, so perhaps the trend that banks can't hold their greens is dying. If so then this will provide a lift to AXP stock as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, transaction companies like AXP, Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Square (NYSE:SQ) rally in sympathy with money center banks. So if the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) rallies then so will the transactors like AXP.In addition, AXP is an excellent financial stock that has proven over the years that they can manage through adversity. Case in point was the debacle over losing the Costco (NASDAQ:COST) account. The stock suffered for a while but has since set new all-time highs.I was lucky to ride the last mega breakout in AXP from the December lows. American Express rallied over 25% so today I am trying to catch the next opportunity. Usually, I consider these technical opportunities tactical trades but this one doubles as a long term conviction investment. This is a stock I want to own for the long term.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever The reaction this morning is slightly negative from the earnings. Management reported a boring quarter where they barely beat the bottom line and narrowly missed sales. The forward guidance was in line so they gave traders nothing to cheer. So AXP will move in line with the overall equity market for now.So if this rally in stocks continues, then AXP stock has the opportunity to break out from $114.40 to target another $10 run from there. There will be resistance there but if the bulls can close above it then the bears will be tired so the stock will overshoot higher.The macroeconomic condition still favors the bullish thesis. We do have threats from lingering headlines of tariff wars. But as we approach another round of elections means that those deals will happen so we go back to trading the profit and loss statements rather than headlines.Most importantly, the threat from the Federal Reserve inverting the curve has disappeared. They have affirmed that they won't cause the short term rates rise above the long term rates so this relives fears for banks. The steeper the curve the better are their profits.For American Express stock, the short term price action from the earnings headline is meaningless for the long term. All global transactions will be electronic so the demand on their services will continue to increase. There are only but a few companies that serve this market and they are a global household name. So they are well set to continue to prosper for years.Then there is the China market opportunity. The U.S. and China are nearing a deal where companies like AXP could have a new opportunity become available in the largest market on the planet.The short term technical threat for AXP stock is at $108 per share. If the bears push price below it they could target $102 per share. This is not a forecast but it is a scenario that could unfold in the next few weeks. But even then, this won't change the overall opportunity for the long term.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-29,"Square (NYSE:SQ), the mobile-payments company, is expected to report earnings on May 1, after market close. Following its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018 as the company became a darling among long-term investors.Source: Via SquareThen Square stock had a rough second half of the year in 2018. And in 2019, although the stock is up 27%, it has lately been exhibiting some price weakness. Thus shareholders are now wondering if they should consider buying the stock prior to the earnings release.Despite the overall strength in price this year, I do not think long-term investors should rush to buy into the shares just yet. When Square reports earnings this week, Wall Street will be able to better gauge the financial health of the company. Although I would not bet against SQ stock's future, I expect to see further volatility and possible price weakness in Square stock in May. Here is why:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Is a Growth Stock in a Competitive IndustryAlthough it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses, individual clients and act more like a traditional bank. Its ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. In other words, through various growth initiatives, management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the fintech sphere.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10 The global payments industry is a $100 trillion plus market. And the so-called fintech revolution is fast changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers.For example, small vendors can now easily accept card payments anywhere and with a minimum set up effort and fees. Individuals, especially the younger generations, are also making a drastic shift to using electronic payments.Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. Square faces competition from many companies, including the global online payments group Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global payments giant.On Feb. 27, SQ reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue. However, the San Francisco-based company, run by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, gave Q1 earnings guidance that came up short of expectations.A growth stock like Square trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. Therefore, since late February, SQ stock price has been in a downtrend. Square Stock and Earnings Season JittersOn May 1, in addition to the headline numbers, such as earnings and adjusted revenues, Square investors will pay particular attention to several numbers, including:  * Gross payment volume (GPV): Square defines GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds. In Q4 2018, the company processed $23 billion in GPV, a year-over-year increase of 28%, driven by growth in larger sellers. Wall Street tracks this metric widely.  * Growth in larger sellers: Square defines larger sellers as those that make more than $125,000 of annualized GPV. At this point, 51% of GPV comes from larger sellers.  * Square's peer-to-peer Cash App: This mobile payment service app had more than 15 million monthly active customers in December 2018. SQ charges 2.75% per transaction to businesses that accept Cash App payments. It also makes money through individuals using the app.  * Square Capital: The business lending arm offers loans to eligible Square sellers. In 2018, Square Capital originated more than $1.6 billion in small business loans. Wall Street is worried about SQ's potential exposure to credit risk.While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has question marks as to whether the group can maintain a sustained growth quarter after quarter.Currently, Square is a domestically focused company and its revenue stream mainly comes from the U.S. In the U.K., it has recently launched the Instant Deposit and Cash App. Although bulls are hopeful that Square can increase its penetration into global markets in the coming years, too, bears argue that if the U.S. economy slows down considerably in the near future, the lack of geographical diversification is likely to hurt the stock price.Therefore, most investors are likely to wait on the sidelines until they have a chance to analyze SQ's balance sheet to see if the stock might be somewhat overvalued. They will also want to see if there is any growth fatigue or major trend changes in the industry.Unless the numbers and the rest of the 2019 guidance are exceptional in May, SQ stock investors may decide not to invest in it for several more weeks … or even months. So Should Investors Buy SQ Stock Ahead of Its Earnings?Square stock is momentum-driven, hence it usually experiences big price swings after reporting earnings. In other words, it can easily gap up if the numbers are better than expected, or if the numbers disappoint, SQ stock can easily gap down, too.The options markets are pricing in an approximate post-earnings move of 10-12% in either direction in SQ shares. In case of a favorable earnings report, my next price target for Square stock in the coming weeks is between $75 - $80.On the other hand, any disappointment in Square's earnings statement or future outlook could quickly send the shares to low the $60's. At this point, through short-term technical analysis, I'm expecting further price decline in Square stock.After the earnings results, I'd not fight the tape and would be willing to re-evaluate the technical charts in the coming days.If you already own SQ stock, you might want to hold your position. However, within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 5%-7% below the current price point.After the upcoming earnings call, in case of a price drop, if you still believe in the bull case for Square stock, then you might consider waiting for a better time to buy, such as when the share price is around $65, or even lower.  * 5 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Under $10 If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider using a covered call strategy with a time horizon of approximately one month. In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of SQ at a limit price of $71.55 (the closing price on April 26) and, at the same time, sell a SQ May 31 $71.5 call option, which currently trades at $3.85 and offers downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in Square stock.This call option would stop trading on May 31, 2019, and expire on June 1. The Bottom Line on Square StockFintech is an evolving and growing industry. With its strong small business focus and proactive management, Square stock is likely to weather the ebbs and flows of the industry. However, there might be a weakness in the SQ stock price in the near-term that potential investors should anticipate.On a final note, if the SQ stock price declines further amid a subdued earnings season, Square may very well become a takeover target.Investors who are interested in growth companies in financial services but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as SQ may also consider investing in various exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have Square stock as a holding. Examples of such funds would include the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF), the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) or the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWF).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-29,"As I've written before, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock was an exaggerated reflection of last year's broad market. As major indices gained in the first three quarters of 2018, Square stock soared. In fact, Square stock nearly tripled over that time. When investors sold off stocks in the fourth quarter, SQ plunged, at one point losing 50% of its value in less than three months.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Oddly, 2019 has been a bit different. Like many stocks, SQ rallied at the beginning of the year. Since the company reported seemingly strong Q4 results back in February, however, Square has diverged from the rest of the market, and the rest of tech. SQ actually has lost about 10% of its value while other ecommerce/payment plays like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) have continued to rise.And so there's an obvious path to upside coming out of Square earnings on Tuesday afternoon. A report that includes both a beat and strong and/or raised guidance should mean that SQ itself can join in the rally. Anything less, however, is a problem. Square stock still isn't cheap and still isn't pricing in any sort of disappointment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy Now  Square Earnings ExpectationsFor the first quarter, Wall Street is expecting Square to continue its impressive revenue growth of late. Consensus estimates suggest a 56% rise in adjusted revenue. Square calculates adjusted revenue as total sales less transaction costs, bitcoin costs, and purchase accounting adjustments.Earnings are expected to be relatively light, at just $0.08, against $0.06 the year before. It's likely that analysts are expecting investments behind key initiatives like the Square Card and the acquisition of Weebly to hit near-term margins and profits.Investors should expect those consensus estimates will be beaten. In fact, Square appears to have topped expectations in every quarter since its late 2015 IPO. With the economy still strong, that trend seems unlikely to change. One potential red flag, if a small one: small business confidence has weakened in recent months.And that trend had better not change. While SQ has struggled in the last two months, it's still up 29% so far this year and still trades at about 90x full-year 2019 EPS estimates. An earnings or guidance miss is not priced in.But at this point, even a headline beat probably isn't enough to move the needle. To some extent, given Square's history of conservative guidance, investors likely are pricing in better results than analysts are modeling. And so a beat and even raised guidance alone aren't likely to lead to a huge gain in SQ stock after earnings. Rather, Q1 earnings might be more about the story Square can tell and the progress it's making in key growth areas. The Story Behind SQ StockTo at least some extent, the core Square business model of providing payment services to small- to mid-sized businesses appears priced in. Again, SQ stock isn't cheap, or close. To get back to the valuations that drove SQ to $100 in early October, Square needs to convince investors it has growth drivers outside of that core business.And so it's likely the ancillary initiatives here that will be the focus of investors, rather than just the headline revenue and EPS growth figures. Investors will want to know whether the integration of Weebly is progressing, as Square looks to become a more viable competitor to Shopify's e-commerce platform.Larger sellers (above $500K in annual volume) are becoming an increasingly large part of Square's ecosystem: that category drove 24% of payment volume in Q4 2018, up from 16% two years before. Further expansion there would limit Square's reliance on more volatile (and more cyclical) small businesses, and perhaps de-risk the story in the eyes of some investors.Square is looking to get a bank license. Investors will be looking for an update on that front. Impressive Venmo user growth has driven PYPL stock higher. Can Square position its own Square Cash app as a viable alternative and a driver for SQ stock?Again, valuation here already is high. In this market, however, it clearly can move higher. But it's not going to be a matter of just 'beating' earnings. Square has to again convince investors that it's a leader in payments with wide-ranging growth opportunities.Doing so will mean that Square gets treated the way it was last year and the way SHOP stock is now. That's the way that the rally in Square stock jumpstarts after Tuesday's report. Is Square Stock a Buy?Is that path viable enough for investors to buy SQ ahead of earnings? It's likely a matter of taste. I've long liked Square as a business, having once compared it to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), if at a much smaller scale. But I've also argued, often incorrectly, that Square stock is overvalued. I think the same is true of Shopify stock at these levels.There are risks both into and out of earnings, as the sharp fall in Q4 showed. Investors clearly have to trust the overall market, given how hard SQ stock fell when overall sentiment turned sour. And competition isn't going anywhere, whether it's Paypal, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), or other private fintech plays.That said, for growth stock investors, there really aren't a lot of opportunities left out there that aren't at all-time highs, or close. And it's possible to see a narrative in which Square earnings are impressive, allowing SQ stock to play 'catch-up' to the rest of tech in coming months. It's not a trade I would make. But ahead of the report, I can see why other, more aggressive, investors might.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-01,"Shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) continued on their torrid run higher in late April after the digital payments provider delivered first quarter numbers that broadly underscored the company's healthy long term growth narrative. Investors were reassured that it remains the unchallenged leader in the secular growth digital payments market, and that the drivers pushing forward this company remain as vigorous as ever. Consequently, the PayPal stock charged higher.Source: Shutterstock This is nothing new for PYPL stock. Over the past several years, the growth narrative supporting PayPal has remained healthy, the numbers have remained robust, and the stock has remained on an upward trajectory. That's why PYPL stock is up more than 200% over the past five years, versus a 40% gain for the S&P 500.Over-performance in PYPL stock will persist. In the big picture, the same things that got PayPal here (i.e. a huge digital payment shift powering big revenue growth and steady margin expansion, against the backdrop of a stable global economy) will continue for the foreseeable future. As such, PYPL stock projects to remain on a winning trajectory for the next several years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares From a numbers perspective, fundamentals support upside in the stock to $125 in 2019. Thus, with PayPal stock trading around $110 today, upside over the next few months looks good. Strong Q1 NumbersPayPal just reported first quarter numbers. From an expectations standpoint, the numbers were mixed. First quarter profits beat. Revenues were in-line. The second quarter guide met on profits, but came in below for revenues. Meanwhile, the full-year revenue guide was in-line with expectations, and profits were guided above the consensus estimate.In the big picture, though, quarterly beats/misses are just noise for PayPal. The bull thesis on PayPal stock boils down to two things. One, the digital payments shift is happening very quickly, and isn't slowing. Two, PayPal is the face of that digital payments shift, without any major or worrisome competition.As such, all investors need out of quarterly earnings is for the numbers to broadly confirm those two things. How? Continued robust revenue growth and healthy margin expansion. Across the board, PayPal delivered just that this quarter. See the important numbers below:  * Total Payment Volume growth of 25%. This marks the third quarter in a row of 25% TPV growth. TPV growth is expected to stabilize at this level, and come in at up ~25% for the full year, too. Thus, TPV growth has been, is, and remains stable north of 20%.  * Active Account growth of 17%. This marks the second consecutive quarter of 17% account growth. That 17% mark is up from 15% in the year-ago quarter and 10% in the two years ago quarter. Thus, account growth is accelerating higher despite tougher laps.  * Adjusted revenue growth came in right around 20% again and is expected to come in around 20% again this year. Thus, revenue growth remains stable around 20%.  * Operating margins expanded 10 basis points in the quarter, and are guided to keep expanding for the full year. Margins have been on a multi-year uptrend. This uptrend isn't going to end anytime soon.Overall, PayPal's numbers underscored the obvious. The digital payments shift is alive and well, and PayPal remains king in that market. So long as those things remain true - and the valuation remains reasonable - PayPal stock will trend higher. Fundamentals Support Upside to $125Zooming out to the big picture, long term growth fundamentals create a visible pathway for PYPL stock to $125 in 2019. The key to the upside? Robust e-commerce growth, and PayPal maintaining its position as a digital payments leader.In 2016, ecommerce accounted for less than 9% of global retail sales. Last year, the ecommerce penetration level reached nearly 12%. By 2021, eMarketer projects it will run towards 18%. And, assuming current secular trends persist, ecommerce will likely run towards 25% of total retail sales by 2025. Meanwhile, global retail sales are moving higher by a few percentage points every year given population growth, increased urbanization, and inflation.Thus, the ecommerce market is one defined by rapidly rising share in a stable growth retail sales market. Ultimately, that combination positions ecommerce retail sales to grow at a healthy 15%-plus clip for the foreseeable future.PayPal is at the center of that 15%-plus growth market. The more sales move to the digital channel, the more consumers will adopt digital payment methods. Of those digital payment methods, PayPal is among the most popular, and has maintained that title despite rising competition.Consequently, as the commerce market grows at 15%-plus rate over the next several years, PayPal's payment volume and revenues should rise at a similar 15%-plus pace.A 15%-plus revenue growth rate, on top of gradual margin expansion, should reasonably drive PayPal's EPS towards $8 by fiscal 2025. Payment processor stocks, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), normally trade around 25 forward earnings. Based on that payment processor average 25 forward multiple, a reasonable fiscal 2024 price target for PYPL stock is $200. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of roughly $125. Bottom Line on PayPal StockPayPal's first quarter earnings report was mixed in terms of beating/missing Street expectations, but that's largely irrelevant. What's important is that through continued robust revenue growth and margin expansion the numbers underscore that the long term growth narrative supporting PYPL stock remains as healthy as ever.So long as that remains true, PayPalstock will remain on a winning trajectory towards $125 in 2019.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long PYPL.

The dive continued this morning, with Square stock falling another 5% from the open.SQ beat both the top and bottom lines, but second-quarter guidance was lower than analyst forecasts. This is an unforgivable sin on Wall Street these days, and investors are punishing Square stock &quot;appropriately.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong other points of contention, SQ management reported a lower gross payment volume than expected. The bears really sunk their teeth into this highlight.  * 5 Stocks to Sell in May Before Investors Go Away Meanwhile, CEO Jack Dorsey's message was that the company is still on target to grow its ecosystem. This is a term that works for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) so perhaps it will for SQ eventually, but it hasn't yet.In reality, after the success of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) earnings, investors expect the same from Square. So this exaggerates the disappointment when the results are not ideal. This is the opposite of what happened with AAPL's earnings situation. Wednesday's rip was perhaps bigger as investors sigh of relief that AAPL earnings were not as bad as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).What didn't help matters for SQ? CFO Amrita Ahuja noted that they will reinvest back into the business. This is code for they will spend a lot of money in order to keep up. Square does face formidable competition from PYPL, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA), so they have to spend to compete.The exciting part about SQ is that it's the new kid on the block. But as it grows it will come into face to face competitive situation with these behemoths. So this is merely an adjustment period and should not change the overall bullish thesis. Management has been executing on plans well to earn our trust and nothing in this report tells us otherwise yet. Trading Square StockSo is this the right time to catch the falling knife? No, but it depends on the time frames of individual investors.So if I am long the stock I don't panic out of it. There is support relief below these levels even after the dip. The zone around $65 per share has been pivotal for almost a year. This should act as support on the way down.Areas of contentions like this are where both bulls and bears agree on value so they fight it out hard. This creates a stall which, in this case, would be support. This is not a hard line in the sand but rather a zone. So even though a big dip of this size usually is not a one-day event, the selling will abate the deeper SQ goes into the pivotal zone. Even if it fails, there is another one just $5 below it.Furthermore, there still is a bullish pattern in play that suggests that SQ stock is targeting $92 per share and this dip doesn't yet kill it. As long as the dip doesn't accelerate the upside scenario is still viable. I do have to admit that this dip severely reduces the odds of it working out this coming quarter.Square stock is not cheap as it sells at nine times sales. But this is not absolutely nuts as it is in line with say Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Visa and MasterCard actually trade at 16 times sales but they have the benefit of running a huge profit. SQ still is not profitable.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for May In the long term, Square is likely to get its act together. They operate in a booming area of electronic payments. The whole world is in the middle of a revolution that is determined to migrate all transaction to electronic format.

2019-05-06,"Square (NYSE:SQ) stock tanked in early May after the payments processor's first-quarter results beat analysts' expectations, but it delivered downbeat Q2 guidance. In the wake of the lackluster guidance, the Street's  growth and competition concerns about SQ were reinvigorated. As a result, SQ stock dropped nearly 10%, falling to its lowest levels since January 2019.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)This selloff of SQ stock is overdone. Square is at the epicenter of a non-cyclical shift in the global economy from cash to cash-less payments. Within that shift, Square's presence and share are growing  across multiple channels, including both the brick-and-mortar and e-commerce fronts. After comparing the company's current market share to its long term total available market, I think SQ has tremendous growth potential over the next several years.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio Plus, the company has a created a suite of subscription and service businesses which should provide  healthy growth catalysts over the next several years. Square is also digging into banking, a potential new growth market which could eventually be quite lucrative. On top of all that, SQ's profit margins are steadily rising.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, Square still is and will continue to grow rapidly, while SQ  has tremendous long term potential.With SQ stock sitting below $70, that potential is being undervalued . As a result, the recent selloff of Square stock appears to provide investors with a chance to buy the shares of a winning company on weakness. The Bears on Square Stock Underestimate SQ's OpportunityAccording to those who are bearish on SQ stock, SQ has built a payments processing empire in the micro-merchant world. But that world is becoming saturated, and in order to continue to generate rapid growth, SQ is expanding by creating solutions for larger sellers. According to the bears, the problem is that these bigger sellers already have a suite of payment processing solutions, ranging from First Data (NYSE:FDC) to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to big banks.Thus, as SQ gets bigger, it's starting to rub elbows more frequently with the competition, and Square is having trouble with all this competition., the detractors of SQ stock say. That's why the company's growth is slowing and this slowdown will persist, causing the richly valued SQ stock to drop, they conclude.That thesis sounds pretty valid. When the company behind a hyper-growth, richly valued growth stock slows down, its shares usually fall. But the bears underestimate  just how big the company's  opportunity is, and how much room Square has to grow, despite its big competitors. SQ Stock Will Win Over the Long-TermThe value of global retail sales was about $24 trillion last year. Square's gross payment volume in 2018 was about $85 billion. Thus, SQ processed just 0.35% of all global retail sales last year.But that's up from 0.23% in 2016, and 0.29% in 2017. Thus, SQ is a small company whose share of the global retail market is rapidly increasing.That trend should persist. Square's non-cyclical tailwinds remain healthy, and consumers continue to use cash-less payments more frequently. Moreover, Square is finally making a big push into e-commerce with its Square Online Store. The company is also rapidly gaining share among large retailers. Further, the company has not yet tried  very hard to penetrate the overseas and banking markets.Square's potent strategies should enable its market share to continue to grow, causing its revenue to rise quickly. Meanwhile,  its margins are consistently trending higher, so its profit growth is and should remain robust.Given all of Square's positive catalysts,  SQ stock should be bought on all major dips, as long as its valuation isn't excessive. The Valuation of SQ Stock Is AttractiveAt its current levels, the valuation of SQ stock is highly attractive for long-term investors.On a trailing price-sales basis, SQ stock is as cheap as it gets in the payments processing world. SQ's trailing sales multiple stands at eight, versus an 8.3 sales multiple for PayPal, and mid-teens sales multiples for Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Also, the valuation of SQ stock bottomed at roughly eight times sales in late 2018, so Square stock is trading just above a meaningful resistance level.Over the long-term, Square's annualized revenue growth should stay at roughly 25% over the next several years, assuming the company continues to gradually grow its share of the global retail marketplace. Adjusted EBITDA margins should ramp from the 18% expected this year towards an eventual peak of 30%.By 2025, I think Square's earnings per share can reach $4.50. All the other payment stocks trade at 30-plus forward price-earnings multiples. Based on a 30 forward multiple, a reasonable 2024 price target for Square stock is $135. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target of over $80. The Bottom Line on SQ StockSQ stock has declined tremendously because of fears that its growth is slowing. But such fears are short-sighted, since its growth is only slowing gradually, and it still has enough long-term potential  to support strong growth for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, investors seem to be ignoring the fact that SQ's margins have been consistently trending upward.Ultimately, this combination of persistently high revenue growth and margin expansion will power SQ stock significantly higher from today's depressed levels.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SQ, PYPL, and SHOP.

2019-05-14,"After nearly reaching $75 per share, Square, (NYSE: SQ) stock is changing hands for around $65 per share. Markets became less bullish on SQ stock after SQ provided weak Q2 guidance.Source: Via SquareEven though its Q1 results beat analysts' consensus outlook, the payment processing firm needs to demonstrate that its initiatives such as its latest partnership with Postmates will be fruitful. With a market capitalization of $28 billion and a forward price-earnings ratio of almost 60, SQ stock is more suitable for growth investors. So how significant is its latest partnership announcement?  * 6 Trade War Stocks With a Lot of Risk  Deal with PostmatesPostmates is a network of couriers who deliver food, groceries, and alcohol locally. Following the deal with Postmates, Square customers can use Postmates' couriers to get goods to customers who place orders with SQ.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare is no stranger to the delivery business. It owns food delivery services firm Caviar, a company it bought in 2014. Yet Postmates will catapult Square's addressable market size because Postmates has a presence in  more than 1,000 cities.After  raising $100 million in January, Postmates is valued at $1.85 billion. Second-Quarter GuidanceSquare needs to grow its addressable market because it lowered its Q2 outlook. It forecast earnings of $0.14 - $0.16 per share of SQ, below the consensus forecast of 18 cents per share of SQ stock . But the top end of the company's full-year revenue guidance range was raised to $2.28 billion from $2.25 billion previously.Many investors clearly sold SQ stock following the guidance because they felt uncertain about SQ's near-term outlook. Yet the company's full-year EPS guidance of $0.74- $0.78 per share was unchanged, indicating that SQ lowered its Q2 EPS guidance because it expects to delay recognizing some of its revenue by a quarter or two. Strong Momentum in Q1Despite the deceleration of Square's business in Q2, the company's  growth in Q1 still justifies the valuation of SQ stock. Specifically, its seller and cash app ecosystem drove total year-over-year revenue growth of 43%. The Valuation of SQ StockThe 22 analysts covering SQ stock are very bullish on it and have an average price target that is about 20% above the stock's recent $66 share price (per Tipranks). If investors think that the company's revenue will grow between 25% and 45% annually for the next five years, a 5-year DCR Revenue Exit model suggests SQ stock could have a fair value that is about 30% above its current price. The Bottom Line on SQThe  downtrend of Square stock  is puzzling because its peers, namely PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V), and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have all traded higher recently. But the company's near-term slowdown is scaring buyers away and creating selling pressure on SQ stock.Investors who missed the rally that took Square stock to $100 in October 2018 have another chance to pick up SQ at a decent level. Consider initially buying a small number of shares of SQ. And from there, average down or up over the next few months.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-15,"Payments processor Visa (NYSE:V) has been a gift that keeps on giving for investors who've held on to their shares. V stock is up roughly 21% so far this year and many believe the firm can keep going. The S&P 500 index is up 13.4% in the same period.Source: Shutterstock However, with a price-earnings ratio of 33.1 and a dividend yield that's below 1%, Visa stock is also an expensive buy. While the V stock price is up there, the company has a lot of room to keep on growing and that make the shares a solid addition to long-term investors' portfolios. Payments Processing GoldmineOne of the biggest reasons investors consider Visa stock at all is the fact that the firm is the largest payments processor in the world, as measured by the number of branded cards issued. That's a big deal because the industry itself has a huge growth runway, so owning the largest beneficiary of that trend has its perks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From People are abandoning cash and opting instead for credit/debit cards and digital payments. Back in 2016 we saw the number of non-cash purchases overtake cash for the first time, and since then the gap has only gotten wider. Visa has been on the receiving end of a great deal of that growth. In 2018, Visa processed 124 billion transactions on its network -- a step up from the 111 billion it facilitated in 2017.Those rising transaction figures are the reason Visa has been able to consistently produce double-digit growth over the past few years, a trend that most expect to continue throughout the medium term. Growth AheadWith the largest number of outstanding cards, Visa has a lot of power over the fees it can charge merchants and it's used that power to grow its margins. As one of the most widely accepted credit cards, Visa appeals to customers and that in turn makes merchants more willing to pay a premium to accept Visa payments.It's also important to recognize that Visa stock isn't just a credit card play anymore, either. V has also started branching out into the digital payments space with Visa Checkout, and the firm has also took a position in Square (NYSE:SQ), a smaller payments processor with a firm foothold in next-generation payment methods.  Times They Are a' ChangingSome argue that Visa's dominance in the payments processing space is actually a negative. The firm's near duopoly with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) in the credit card space could make it a target for regulatory action, especially as cash payments continue to dwindle and it becomes more and more necessary to have a credit card on-hand. Plus, there's further to fall when you're already at the top. Investors aren't wrong in saying that Visa stock has high expectations to live up to. We saw that materialize in the second quarter when V announced its earnings results. Despite the fact that Visa beat earnings expectations and met revenue predictions, the stock declined as investors digested the news. For those investors who like the payments sector but looking for broader exposure than just one name, the ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEArca:IPAY) might be the way to play it, with V stock, MA and SQ among the top holdings in its 40-stock portfolio. Visa Stock's Worth The PriceSure, there are risks when it comes to buying Visa stock. If you're a value investor, it can be worrisome to invest in a stock that's trading near all-time highs. However, it's important to note that Visa is almost always trading near all-time highs because the firm delivers solid growth more often than not.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days The buy case for Visa stock is a simple one: the firm has a commanding market share in an extremely scalable business. The growth opportunity is there and Visa doesn't have to work hard to get it. While some of its peers like American Express (NYSE:AXP) are considerably cheaper -- at a P/E of 14.9 -- Visa offers a level of stability and security that others can't simply because of its size and reach.As long as you believe that non-cash transactions will continue gaining momentum, V stock will be a worthwhile consideration. Don't let the company's price-tag scare you, it almost never trades at a huge discount. Visa is the kind of stock you buy and hold on to for years, so its worth a look for long-term investors.

2019-05-17,"The technical outlook for Square (NYSE:SQ) isn't all that rosy, despite how well the company has done over the past few years. Indeed, Square stock has been a beast on the long side and has made many loyal investors a hefty sum of cash. But even with the stock market in rally mode for much of 2019, Square stock has been absent.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)What's going on?Shares have been rolling over as it appears there's been a bit of a &quot;buyer's strike&quot; regarding Square. While Square stock had a violent rally off its December lows, shares are actually flat since Jan. 15. Compare that to its peers and Square stock investors may be getting frustrated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is up 22.5% in the same timeframe, while the PowerShares QQQ ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) is up 13%. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are up 18% and 28%, respectively. The year-to-date numbers are even worse.Stock YTD Return SQ 17% QQQ 19.3% V 24% MA 33.6% PYPL 33.8% I know it's hard to complain about a 17% gain for the year, but considering the fourth quarter that we endured, a snap-back rally like that is to be expected. The fact that it's lagging the QQQs and has generated just 50% of the return from its most compared to competitor (PYPL), and SQ stock is frustrating.Will that underperformance continue? Trading SQ Stock  Click to EnlargeAbove is the weekly chart for Square stock. You can clearly see that Square was enjoying a nice, solid uptrend (blue line) for the better part of a year. However, that uptrend came to an end in Q4 2018, when the markets took a painful fall. Square, which was already elevated from its uptrend by quite a bit, was no exception to this selloff.In October, SQ stock hit a 52-week high of $101.15. By mid-December, shares had fallen more than 50% at its lows when it hit $49.82.On the bounce, shares ran to that $77.50 to $80 area, which effectively capped SQ stock from January through April. At $81.56 is the 61.8% retracement for the 52-week range, which more or less acted as resistance. Unfortunately, the 38.2% retracement at $69.43 did not support SQ stock on the downside, nor did the 50-week moving average.I worry about Square in the short- to intermediate term if it can't get over some of these technical levels. Specifically, I want to see Square over the 10-week moving average and above the 38.2% retracement. Over downtrend resistance (purple line) would eventually be nice too.If it can't do that though, it's prone to more declines. Those declines are exacerbated in the event that U.S. stocks take a bigger hit. I have my sights on three potential downside levels: $60 is a notable level of both resistance and support and only gave way amid a flood of selling in December. At $55 is the 100-week moving average, which should provide a bounce should SQ stock test it.Finally, a retest of the lows near $50 should attract buyers. I don't expect this level without a larger flush in the broader market. Bottom Line on Square StockSquare has been a multi-year stud, but that action has not translated to 2019. The company still has a terrific growth profile, with analysts modeling revenue and earnings to grow 43.5% and 60% this year, respectively; 2020's forecast is solid too, at 35% and 49% growth, respectively.While management provided a solid full-year outlook on May 1, second-quarter guidance came up a bit short. At 88 times this year's earnings (after the earnings pullback), SQ stock doesn't have much room for error. Disappointing on guidance, however marginal, can sap momentum in a hurry.Let's see where Square stock can firm up and whether it can regain momentum. Over the 10-week will be the first sign of turning it around.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long V.

2019-05-21,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Square NYSE SQ continues its slide The San Francisco based payment services company has moved lower even as its peers continue to see their stocks go higher Despite a,"With $83 on the Horizon, Square Stock Finally Is Cheap Enough to Buy"
2019-05-21,"Square (NYSE:SQ) continues its slide. The San Francisco-based payment services company has moved lower even as its peers continue to see their stocks go higher. Despite a steady decline, analysts have mostly held to their price targets on Square stock. Although SQ may remain range-bound for some time to come, investors now have an opportunity to make a trade.  Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified) Given Square's recent trading activity, where it goes from here remains in question. The stock has fallen steadily since its 2019 peak of $82.78 per share in late February. The company provided weak guidance in its quarterly report on May 1. Hence, earnings and revenue beats for the most recent quarter failed to stem the tide. As a result, SQ trades near the $65 per share level.What makes this more confusing is that our increasingly cashless society will require Square's services. This trend has benefitted peers such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) over the last year. Consequently, PayPal and peers such as Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) have exhibited remarkably similar trading patterns over the last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Not Square.I had taken a bearish position on Square stock in recent months. Even with an improving outlook, I thought SQ would face short-term pain back in March. However, with a further 15%, I have recently begun to hold a more bullish outlook. Square Stock Should Clear TargetsAnalysts appear to agree. The average price target on SQ currently stands at $83.50 per share, very close to the stock's 2019 high. On the low end, one analyst set a $30 per share price target. I could see such a price in a recession. However, with a growing economy and a predicted earnings growth rate of 59.6% this year, I do not think such an outcome will occur.The highest current price target comes in at $101 per share, near the level of its 52-week high. Hence, barring a recession, SQ stock should remain in its range for now.The good news for SQ bulls is that the stock price can rise even if Square remains range-bound. Although profit growth will fall modestly, Wall Street predicts that earnings will still grow at an average rate of 45.47% per year over the next five years. Currently, SQ also supports a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of about 57. With its current level of profit growth, I do not see the PE ratio falling significantly in the near term. Square Stock and ExpansionFor investors who want to look beyond the short term, Square also continues to bolster its ecosystem with new products and initiatives. One example involves its Square Online store.After acquiring Weebly, it was able to offer clients a more comprehensive online store. This now makes Square a competitor of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and expands its reach in the fast-growing e-commerce industry. Now, with its recent alliance with Postmates, the reach of its ecosystem expands further.Financial services has also become a focus. Square already makes business loans. In recent months, it has also attempted to expand on its Cash App and break into banking itself. However, this move to gain FDIC approval and become an industrial loan company still needs to pass regulatory hurdles.Moreover, Square has only scratched the surface of its potential reach. Currently, the company only operates in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, and the U.K. Though it has not announced plans to move into other countries, it holds tremendous potential offshore.All of these factors should eventually translate into growth for SQ stock, even if the equity remains range-bound for some time to come. The Bottom Line on Square StockThanks to the falling price, traders have an improved opportunity for short-term gain as the long-term outlook improves for investors. A falling stock price continues to take SQ toward the lower end of its current range.Analysts have held to their $83.50 per share price target. Further, Square continues to expand its ecosystem as they add e-commerce storefronts, small business loans, and delivery. The company also offers a bright future to investors with likely moves into banking and other foreign markets.Whether one wants to make a short-term trade or build a long-term investment, SQ stock has fallen to a level where both types of investors can likely swipe in profits.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-22,"Another jittery week seems to be upon the markets as news headlines highlight that the U.S.-China trade negotiations may be at an impasse. Trade is not a zero-sum game and tariff tiffs will likely affect many companies, countries, and consumers at different levels. Understandably many investors are beginning to get nervous as to where stocks in their portfolios may be headed next. Therefore, today I'd like to discuss the short and long-term outlook for Square (NYSE:SQ), the mobile-payments company.Source: Via SquareFintech is an evolving and growing industry. And the global economy is gradually shifting from cash to cash-less payments. With its strong small business focus and proactive management, Square stock is likely to weather the long-term ebbs and flows of the industry. However, there might be further weakness in the SQ stock price -- after losing 9.2% in the past month -- in the near-term that potential investors should anticipate. Square's Growing EcosystemAlthough it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses, individual clients and act more like a traditional bank. Its most recent earnings report released on May 1 and accompanying shareholder letter provide a good overview of the growth in service offerings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare's ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. In other words, through various growth initiatives, SQ management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the fintech apps sphere as well as a small business platform that offers a wide range of services.For example, SQ's peer-to-peer mobile payments Cash App has more than 15 million monthly active customers. Square charges 2.75% per transaction to businesses that accept Cash App payments. It also makes money through individuals using the app.  * 6 Chinese Stocks That Could Pop On a Trade Deal Management would like to see the Cash App become more like a traditional bank whose core customers are small businesses as well as individuals. As the younger generations especially are making a drastic shift to using electronic payments, Square would like to capture that growth.In October 2018, the group announced Square Installments, which lets customers pay in monthly installments. Previously, Square had also launched Square Capital, which provides short-term loans to small businesses that use its service to process credit card payments.Clearly, Square is expanding its services and merchant ecosystem across different channels and many growth investors are bullish long term on Square stock. However, they would need to pay special attention to how each business that Square is now chasing contributes to the bottom line.While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has some questions as to whether the group can maintain a sustained growth quarter after quarter. What Could Derail Square Stock Fundamentally?The global payments industry is a $100 trillion plus market. And the fintech apps revolution is fast changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers.Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. Square faces competition from many well-capitalized companies, including the global online payments group PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global payments giant.To be sure, not every area Square expands into will necessarily translate into easy money. Unless Square increases its revenue base, Wall Street may not be too forgiving about the SQ stock price. Therefore, from a valuation point of view, I'd urge long-term investors to exercise caution with the current price levels.For example, many analysts are expressing doubts over Square's expansion into the loan business and questioning whether the company is taking on too much risk.Another are of potential concern would be declining growth in transaction fees, which still provide the majority of revenues. Square's shifts toward subscription and services revenues may not be enough to make up for the decline in transaction fees.The May 1 earnings report showed that the group's gross payment volume (GPV) grew to $22.6 billion, at a relatively modest rate 27%. Yet Wall Street was concerned about this growth rate.In other words, shareholders would need to decide whether the company has potentially diversified way too much and away from its core business of payment processing. Therefore, they'd need to regularly re-assess their views based on company and sector developments as well as earnings statements. Where is Square Stock Price Now?Let us briefly remember how SQ stock price has acted over the years.Following its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018 as the company became a darling among long-term investors.With such high return on initial investments, many investors look at the future through rose-colored glasses as they tend to assume growth rates will accelerate for many years. That's how recent IPOs usually become momentum stocks. However, if growth decelerates, then the stock price usually suffers. In other words, a momentum stock like Square trades in line with revenue growth trends and expectations.Despite the euphoria in the first three years, SQ stock price has been exhibiting price weakness since all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. This year, although the stock is so far up 16%, April and May have not been good months for shareholders. The weak Q2 guidance issued during the Q1 conference call triggered the recent downtrend.If you are looking for an entry signal to buy SQ shares, from a technical chart perspective, I am not expecting the stock to make a significant leg up any time soon. Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur.And, I do not expect the SQ stock price to reach the $100 level any time soon; the market may be starting to price the stock with a more realistic and fair view.The daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect nearer-term trading in SQ to be choppy at best. So Should You Buy SQ Stock in May?I believe the volatility and selling in the markets will continue in May as well as in June. Like many momentum plays, SQ stock is likely to be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.Depending on news headlines, Square stock may trade sideways for several days, only to continue to pullback toward the low-$60's level, where it is likely to find initial support.If the support around $60 level does not hold, then it may fall further to $50 level, where I'd expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until the next earnings release, expected in late July.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) Indeed, Square stock may become one of the first momentum stocks to test the lows it saw between $49-50 in December 2018, hence making a double bottom in technical charts. Only then the twice-touched low may become a more reliable long-term support level.In other words, I'd not rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I'd get ready to initiate a position as the price declines further, toward $50. I'd also consider buying covered calls in conjunction with going long on SQ shares.If you already own the shares, you might want to stay the course and hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date. Bottom Line on Square StockStocks suffer during times of uncertainty and the current political and economic fundamentals offer plenty of questions. Therefore, I'd encourage potential new investors to wait for a few weeks until the smoke clears from the markets and until buyers are definitively back in control in Square shares.Until that time, Square is likely to be a one-step forward, two-steps back kind of stock until it reaches low $50's level. On a final note, if the SQ stock price declines further amid a subdued earnings season, the company could very well become a takeover target.As of this writing, the Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-23,"If there's one investment I regret missing out on, it's retail-technology outfit Square (NYSE:SQ). During the summer of 2016, SQ stock dropped to single digits. Late last year, the company completed a dramatic turnaround, with shares briefly touching $100. But even at its current price of just under $66, Square has done well for its long-time stakeholders.Source: Via SquarePartially, I blame the cryptocurrency surge for taking my eyes off the ball. The concept surrounding Square stock is so simple yet so incredibly ingenious. Take a small card-swiper, make it compatible with popular smartphones, and presto! You have a platform that enables small-business owners to compete with the alpha dogs of their industries.I've seen firsthand how this diminutive square device has transformed my local business community. In the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) era where anything physical is subject to disruption, Square brought disruption for -- and in favor of  -- the little guy. This breathed new life in the broader brick-and-mortar business model, fueling SQ stock gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Over 20% Upside Potential That said, the second quarter of this year is not turning out favorably for the company's equity. Since the beginning of April, Square stock is down nearly 14%.Most of that ugliness comes down to Square's disappointing second-quarter earnings report. While the tech firm beat the consensus print for both earnings per share and revenue, management shared profitability and sales guidance that fell short of analysts' estimates. As a result, SQ stock slipped and still looks pensive.The other problem is competition. Major players, such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), have seen their revenues disrupted by  third party payment processors like Square, Stripe and other fintech entrants. They have the resources, though, to return the favor, casting a cloud on Square stock. SQ Stock Sitting on a Japanese GoldmineNow, I'm not going to guess the nearer-term price swings. Clearly, the bullishness in SQ stock got a little out of hand last year. The latest earnings report brought the speculative fever back down to earth. Ultimately, I think this is a good thing for patient investors seeking an ideal time to jump aboard.That's because Square stock has viable opportunities both here and abroad. In the U.S., small businesses are the engine of the economy. They've also contributed the most nominally to the recent employment surge. Arming them with the tools to succeed is always a net positive.But one of the international markets I'm most excited for regarding SQ stock is Japan. Historically, Japan was a cash-based society, and even to this day, this dynamic remains. It's one of the country's strange contradictions: a tech leader that still transacts in paper.In order to juice-up its economy, the Japanese government is desperately urging its citizenry to adopt card and digital payments. Initiatives are working, albeit very slowly. In fact, taxi drivers in Japan have only recently started to accept credit cards, but most still prefer cash.Since Square stock is an indirect investment into the cashless trend, Japan initially appears a headwind. But here's the thing: Japan is getting older rapidly, so old habits are likely to fade. Furthermore, the Japanese are very well-traveled, and are eager to adopt certain western conveniences.As the next generation of Japanese entrepreneurs and small-business owners step in, they'll serve the next generation of consumers. Very likely, these younger customers and clients will prefer cashless payments. With Square already levering a relatively significant presence in Japan, it's in prime position to profit.That alone could send SQ stock soaring. Buy the Discount in Square StockAdmittedly, my thesis will take some time to filter through to the SQ stock price. But it's also an underreported concept that deserves more attention.Although we typically consider Japan a tech giant, the country is also happy living a contradiction. As more or less a conservative society, change might be slow. Eventually, though, I think it will occur. When it does, it will hit like a tsunami.For one thing, Japan is the world's third-largest economy, and it's not going to give up that slot easily. Of course, it has a penchant for all things high tech. Finally, the Japanese have adopted cryptocurrency at a much quicker rate than many other nations, suggesting a willingness to try new things.When Japan does go cashless, it will catch many companies by surprise. Not Square, which knows full well what's up. Therefore, you should consider getting ahead of this hidden trend, not behind it.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-24,"It seems like nothing can stop PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). After a brief slowdown during the bear market in late 2018, PayPal stock had returned to its late-summer highs by January.Source: Shutterstock The move higher continued, and now it trades at record highs. Given the growth in the payments industry, PYPL will continue its rise long term. However, the question is not whether to buy PYPL stock, but if investors should choose it over its closest peers.PayPal stock continues to register impressive growth, even as it seeks to address the competitive threat posed by Square (NYSE:SQ). Fueling this is a rising cashless society and a move toward more ecommerce. This bolsters not only PayPal stock and that of Square, but also payment processors such as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend This increase continues at a steady but significant pace. According to eMarketer, retail ecommerce sales will rise from $3.453 trillion this year to $4.878 trillion by 2021.PayPal may have also become a force in the banking business itself. Its digital wallet, Venmo, has risen to over 40 million accounts as of the first quarter. Venmo also registered a 73% increase on payments on its platform. This compares well to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) with 37 million digital accounts and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) who with 29.8 million digital users. PYPL lags only JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which claims 51 million active accounts. A Closer Look at PayPal StockGiven this increase, I see ample room for growth for all major players involved. The predicted profit increases in PayPal stock represents the growth well. Analysts expect earnings increases to come in at 23.1% this year and 17.8% next year.This has also brought somewhat higher price-to-earnings (PE) ratios across the industry. PayPal's forward PE now stands at 32.1. While not cheap, that appears inexpensive compared to SQ stock and its 59.3 forward PE ratio. Moreover, the multiples of Visa and Mastercard are somewhat lower, but not by much.But here's the thing.In this sector, multiples tend to rise with rates of profit growth. Square supports a significantly higher PE ratio. However, Wall Street believe SQ's profits will rise by 59.6% this year and 49.3% the next.In 2020, Square's profits will grow at about 2.5 times PayPal's earnings this year. Next year, Square will roughly triple PayPal's growth rate. Given this differential, I see a case for buying SQ when its forward multiple comes in a less than double PayPal's PE ratio.Conversely, investors can pay about 26.4 times forward earnings for Visa. Following what looks like an industry trend, that will buy investors lower but still impressive growth rates. Analysts expect Visa will see a 16.5% earnings increase this year and a 15.6% rate in 2020.Moreover, PYPL has risen more than 46% from its December low. This comes in substantially higher than the 33%-plus growth in SQ over the same period. Given this rapid rise, I cannot rule out a short-term correction. What should investors do?PayPal stock will remain a growth equity for years to come, but it may not outperform a key peer. PYPL trades near record highs. Its massive profit increase justifies its PE ratio in the low 30s. However, one cannot ignore Square stock, which offers almost triple the growth at less than double the valuation.Again, I do not think this negates the bull thesis in PayPal stock. I also believe payment stocks will generally continue to rise long-term. In my view, it comes down to risk tolerance. Investors more comfortable with lower multiples should consider PayPal or maybe Visa. However, for those who will willingly pay a higher PE for more elevated growth levels, Square stock might make a better choice.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-28,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average has suffered a bruising recently. The index posted its fifth straight weekly decline, and is now down 3.79% so far this month. However it’s not all doom and gloom. On Monday, Dow Jones futures traded up thanks to the news that President Trump and Japan’s Prime Minister Abe Shinzo met to discuss a whole host of trade issues.“Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!” tweeted President Trump on May 26.And from an investing perspective, there are certainly compelling stocks to be found in the index. You just have to know where to look. Luckily TipRanks has released a new tool that allows you to compare stocks- and pinpoint the most promising investing opportunities. Here we ran a screen on all the stocks in the Dow Jones- and then sorted the results from the most to least bullish according to the Street. View Stock Comparison Tool As you can see these 5 stocks all boast a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus based on ratings published by analysts over the last three months. Here’s why these are the five favorite Dow stocks of analysts right now: Microsoft (MSFT)In first place comes software giant Microsoft. Even though shares are down in May, the stock is still trading up 24% year-to-date. And according to five-star Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan, plenty of upside lies ahead. He has just reiterated his buy rating with a $145 price target after attending the Microsoft Build Developer Conference a couple of weeks ago. From current levels that indicates shares can surge 15%.Following the conference, Horan told investors it’s become “obvious that the company has totally restructured itself around the intelligent edge cloud.” As a result it is now better positioned to create and drive new services through developer partnerships. According to Horan, MSFT sees Azure as a base layer that customers use to run their applications but also as a building block for MSFT services up the software &quot;stack&quot;. That’s through dozens of new PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings. Plus MSFT's services are being re-architected to run on Azure—Office 365, Dynamics 365, LinkedIn and Teams. By running on Azure, MSFT applications become cheaper to operate and easier to innovate and integrate. “We are just at the beginning of this transformation, with innovation accelerating” the analyst concludes. Overall, 22 out of the 24 analysts polled rate Microsoft a ‘Buy’- hence its ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. See what other Top Analysts are saying about MSFT.  Visa (V)Next up comes the mighty payments processor Visa. Like Microsoft, Visa has posted impressive gains year-to-date (23%), however in the last month shares have marginally pulled back in keeping with the broader market.But there’s plenty to look forward to. Notably, Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider has just initiated coverage of the stock. He starts Visa off with a buy rating and a bullish $188 price target, citing volume growth in Europe, price increases and an expanding business payments unit. Schneider believes Visa enjoys ‘multiple opportunities’ to beat current consensus estimates. He also singles out upcoming product announcements and earnings reports as positive price catalysts. And for investors cautious about pending legal and regulatory issues, Schneider has a reassuring point. He notes that both Visa and Mastercard have escaped recent litigation relatively unscathed, by settling claims with minimal financial impact or change to their market leading positions.This isn’t the only analyst optimistic about Visa’s outlook. In the last three months Visa has received 18 buy ratings and just 1 hold rating. “We remain attracted to Visa's dominant position in the global card network market and its strong, recognizable international brand” cheers Cantor Fitzgerald’s Joseph Foresi. Looking forward, he sees a basket of catalysts pushing V higher, including Visa Direct, contactless payments, & B2B to name but a few. See what other Top Analysts are saying about V.  Disney (DIS)These are exciting times for Disney. The company is on the brink of launching its much-hyped streaming service Disney+. And it has just allowed a lucky few into its new Star Wars Land, &quot;Galaxy's Edge&quot; at Disneyland, California. One of the visitors to the new park was Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger. Although he wasn’t allowed to take photos, Juenger nevertheless revealed that the two main attractions (Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run, and Rise of the Resistance) were &quot;absolutely jaw-dropping.&quot;For investors, Juenger advised that the attraction will exceed reasonable guest expectations by a wide margin; and that it is more incremental for revenue than previously imagined. That’s because in Disneyland, it adds almost 14 acres of capacity, while in Disney World it will utilize the most-underused gate, meaningfully expanding overall guest capacity.&quot;This is the biggest attraction we’ve ever built,&quot; Scott Trowbridge, Portfolio Creative Executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, said in a recent presentation. &quot;It should be epic, because, Star Wars, right? That’s why we’re going big with this attraction.&quot; The Disneyland park will open on May 31, and from June 24 it will be possible to enter without reservations. Encouragingly, Disney’s recent earnings report shows a bullish story for theme parks. The Parks and Consumer Products segment delivered results roughly $200M above consensus estimates. “The segment has been a key growth driver for the company over the last few years, accounting for roughly 60% of total segment operating income gains from '16-'19E” writes Rosenblatt’s Mark Zgutowicz.“We are encouraged the company continues to invest in this segment with Star Wars Galaxy Edge opening in May/ August in CA/FL, as well as Marvel properties and expanding in Asia. We assume the segment is able to continue to grow returns at roughly the same rate over the next five years” concludes the analyst. This ‘Strong Buy’ stock boasts 15 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings, while the average analyst price target comes in at $152. See what other Top Analysts are saying about DIS.  United Health (UNH)Managed healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group has had a bumpy ride recently. That’s as UNH, and indeed the health care sector in general, continue to be pressured by worries around “Medicare For All.” This proposes a transition to a national single payer health plan backed by a number of the Democrats’ 2020 presidential hopefuls.“Although the extreme versions of such a bill would be devastating to the healthcare sector, we see no shot of them going through in today's (and tomorrow's) political environment” writes top-ranked Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn. He reiterated his buy rating recently with a $305 price target indicating robust upside potential of 23%.“We believe the regulatory fears that have pressured the group are significantly overblown. We would be buyers of UNH on the weakness and maintain our Outperform rating” advises the analyst. He is a fan of the company’s diversification, strong track record, elite management team and exposure to certain higher growth businesses (including the Optum IT business). A similar message comes from Citigroup’s Ralph Giacobbe. Tellingly, the analyst has just upgraded UNH from Hold to Buy. He also boosted his price target considerably from $247 to $280. &quot;We acknowledge that the diversification story isn’t a new phenomena, but buying a bellwether name at discounted valuation presents an attractive opportunity considering the pullback has largely been premised on fears that we don’t expect to materialize” explains Giacobbe. Overall, UNH scores a buy rating from 10 out of 11 analysts polled by TipRanks. The average analyst price target works out at $284 (15% upside potential). See what other Top Analysts are saying about UNH.  Cisco Systems (CSCO)For our final best-rated Dow stock we have network leader Cisco Systems. The company has just posted a slightly ahead of consensus quarter on nearly all metrics once again. “Overall market demand and execution prove resilient; maintain Outperform” celebrated Baird analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver following the report.“Management continues to string together solid quarters during the ramp phase for Cat 9K and SD-WAN. Cisco's EPS algorithm produced normalized growth of 18% in 3Q19, which appears sustainable for the visible future” commented the analyst. He has a $57 price target on shares. Cisco reported FQ3 revenue/non-GAAP EPS of $12,958 million/ $0.78, representing revenue growth of 4% YoY (+6% excl. SPVSS), versus consensus of $12,889 million/$0.77. Meanwhile gross margin was up roughly 50 bps QoQ and up 70 bps YoY. The key takeaway: “We remain enthusiastic towards the product strategy and runway for growth over the next several years despite some concerns over a shakier spend macro and political instability.” Clearly the Street shares this upbeat analysis. With a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus, 15 out of 19 analysts give CSCO the thumbs up. Their average price target works out at $59 for 9% upside potential. That’s with shares surging 25% year-to-date- and experiencing a relatively minor dip of 3% in May. See what other Top Analysts are saying about CSCO.

2019-05-28,Social media giant Facebook could quickly become a powerful player in the cryptocurrency and digital payments markets.,What is Facebook’s GlobalCoin?
2019-05-29,"Last year the impression was that banks couldn't hold their rallies, so it was easy to short the financial centers. But that was not the case for the payment transactors like Square (NASDAQ:SQ). The perception is that these financial tech -FinTech -- companies are more tech than financials, so their stocks were soaring. But SQ stock has recently hit a snag and it lags the group.Source: Via SquareYear-to-date, SQ stock is still outperforming the S&P 500, up 16%, but that's about half as much Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and about eight percentage points worse than American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa (NYSE:V).For the last three months it's even worse. SQ is down 21% when the rest are still up for the same period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo, is this relative slack in Square stock's performance an opportunity to bet on the bounce? Or is it a leading indicator that the rest of the gang will revert lower? My bet is that the fintech sector is still a bullish bet and that any weakness in Square is an opportunity to buy. For the last two years, SQ stock is up 184% which is more than double its competition. SQ Stock and the MarketIt is important to note that the whole equity market is being held hostage by the crisis of sentiment that we are having due to the tariff war. Keep that in mind for all bullish write ups inside that context.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June First, let's examine the whole fintech sector and why it's a definite winner for the long term. The globe has committed to moving as many financial transactions as possible online, and companies like Square are already there. This is a trend that is not likely to reverse, so demand on their products and services is likely to stay strong for decades. There are smaller companies coming into the arena, but I bet the ones already there will have the advantage.Fundamentally, SQ stock is still relatively new, so it's the most expensive of the bunch. Wall Street gives it the higher valuation because in theory it delivers the most growth. So far, management has not faltered, so this credit should continue until they show that growth is abating.In their last earnings report, SQ beat the metrics but were cautious with their guidance. So the message is that they continue to successfully execute on plans. Don't panic because of the muted guidance -- this is management padding their expectations. Eventually this, too, shall pass and the stock should play catch-up with the rest.SQ stock sells at 8x sales. So although it loses money, it's twice as cheap as Visa and MA, both of which sell at over 16x price to sales. So after a big stock dip like this, I can consider it a value trade here. A lot of the froth has already fallen off.But the best argument for a Square rally scenario from here is technical.The weekly chart shows that SQ stock just bounced off an important support zone. The area around $60 per share has been pivotal for over a year. Bulls and bears are willing to fight over it, which in turn creates congestion. On the way down, this translates into support.Moreover, Square stock still maintains a higher low trend off the Christmas bounce. This is also bumping against the descending line of lower highs, so now it comes into a tight point. Usually, these explode in a big move, and after so much of the froth has already left the stock, I bet odds are it surges higher.If so, the immediate target would be the April and February fail points at $75.50 and $82 per share, respectively.Conversely, stocks are still hostage to geopolitical headline risk, so overall sentiment is sour. Square stock rallies would probably need the help of overall market action. So if the general malaise persists on Wall Street, then SQ is vulnerable.Below $61 per share, it could trigger a retest of the December lows near $51. I don't see this happening, but the technical bearish pattern looms and the neckline is close. So if this is a short-term trade then I have to set tight stop loss triggers. Else, I can hold Square stock for the long term as it will be a winner.In short, Square stock has solid fundamentals in a popular sector. And now also has favorable technical setups. This makes it an attractive bullish bet for the next few weeks.The experts on Wall Street are split on the rating between buy and hold, but they all agree that its stock should be higher. It's trading now well below their average price target near $83.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-06-03,"A year ago, Square's (NYSE:SQ) equity lift signaled an overheated market. SQ stock touched $100 at the end of September, a valuation that seemed close to unsupportable. That turned out to be the peak for the tech firm. The broad market turned and SQ lost half its value in less than three months.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)For the first two months of this year, Square stock followed the market back up, bouncing some 50%. But investors have soured. Since March 1, SQ stock has dropped about 20%, and it's somewhat of an odd decline. Other payment plays are doing well. Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), perhaps the most direct peer, has doubled so far this year, leading to widespread concern about its valuation.Yet SQ stock has been left out of this rally. Plus its valuation, while still high, has declined. For the first time in a while, SQ looks potentially intriguing. It's not quite cheap enough yet, but that could change in the coming months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why Has SQ Stock Come Down?The easy answer for why SQ has struggled over the last three months is that earnings have &quot;disappointed.&quot; More specifically, guidance has disappointed. Square beat earnings expectations in the third quarter but investors didn't like the Q4 guidance. The pattern repeated with Q4 actuals in late February, with SQ stock falling after that report too. Once again, following the Q1 release, investor concerns about the outlook for Q2 sent shares tumbling.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Of course, the fact that the same pattern has repeated three straight times seems a bit strange. At a certain point, investors would seem to realize that Square is guiding conservatively. In each of the last three quarters, Square easily outpaced initial guidance.For instance, ahead of Q1, Square projected adjusted revenue of $472 million to $482 million; the actual figure was $489 million. Adjusted earnings per share of 11 cents handily beat forecast, which ranged from 6 cents to 8 cents.If guidance again is conservative, then Square's Q2 numbers should come in right about where analysts projected ahead of the quarter. And it's worth noting that full-year guidance was pretty much in line with those expectations.Earnings haven't been spectacular relative to expectations, but they've been good enough. And expectations aside, performance has been close to spectacular. Adjusted revenue increased 59% year-over-year in Q1, and 49% excluding help from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 62%. Square is growing like gangbusters, yet investors don't seem all that impressed. Peers Are Doing FineThat said, it does seem like earnings are the culprit because investor attitudes toward similar stocks still seem positive. Shopify shares have nearly doubled YTD. While SQ stock has lost 20% since March 1, other payment plays have rallied.SHOP is up a whopping 44%. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has gained 11%. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) are up 11% and 8%, respectively. Tech stocks on the whole, as measured by the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite, are about flat.Here too, the declines seem a bit strange. It's not as if optimism toward Square's opportunity has changed all that much. In fact, looking at similar securities, that optimism has risen. Yet Square stock continues to fade and is currently threatening a four-month low. The Case for and Against Square StockThere's one big issue, however. The declines in SQ of late seem strange, but they're also coming off levels that looked far too high to begin with. And even with the pullback, Square stock isn't cheap, or close. Shares still trade at about 10x adjusted revenue, even backing out cash. On the same basis, forward price-earnings ratio is in the 55x range.And there are some modest concerns beneath the headline numbers. Growth in smaller accounts has decelerated to the range of about 17% in Q1. That puts pressure on Square's ability to grow with larger accounts. To attract those customers, Square may have to give better pricing, and spend more money. As I've pointed out relative to SHOP, cyclical weakness could hit small business -- still about half of revenue -- and lead to a quick slowdown in growth.There are still concerns here, but there's still an intriguing story, and a lower valuation. I've compared Square to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the past, given its potential to expand beyond its initial business. And Square is delivering on its promise, at least in the early stages.Whether the price is cheap enough is in the eye of the beholder. From here, 55x forward earnings, given the risks, isn't quite cheap enough. And it seems likely -- particularly if broad market fears accelerate -- that SQ stock will continue to fade. But the story here is attractive, and the valuation more reasonable. It's not entirely clear why that valuation has come in. But if it continues to do, SQ could indeed become too cheap to ignore.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-04,"I recently came across a stat from April in the Globe and Mail that caught my attention. Specifically, UBS (NYSE:UBS) listed the ten most overweighted and underweighted stocks in the MSCI AC World Index. The number one overweighted stock was Visa (NYSE:V) with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) also making the list in the sixth spot. Being on this list certainly isn't bad news for Visa stock.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrWhy is the UBS list important?Merrill Lynch research shows that stocks overweighted by portfolio managers underperform stocks underweighted by those same managers over the long haul. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe fact that both Visa stock and Mastercard made the top ten overweighted stocks should at least have shareholders of the respective companies revisiting why they own the stocks. Currently, both stocks are trading at 17 times sales. Is either of them worth owning? Why don't we have a look?  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault  The Big Reason to Own Visa StockVisa CEO Al Kelly recently spoke to Barron's about the opportunities that exist for the $353 billion financial services company. Naturally, Visa continues to benefit from the secular trend to electronic payments away from cash and checks. Of course, so too does Mastercard. However, it is business-to-business payments that's got Kelly excited.&quot;We're already the biggest player in the world in (B2B),&quot; Kelly told Barron's contributor Tae Kim. &quot;Yet I think there is enormous upside. If I use the baseball analogy, we're probably no more than in the second inning as it relates to the B2B opportunity around the world.&quot;A new product for Visa in the B2B space that's sure to drive revenue growth is B2B Connect, the company's cross-border supplier payments platform to simplify international B2B transactions. While Visa Direct helps small- and medium-sized businesses process payments across borders, B2B Connect will allow large businesses to process big-ticket transactions efficiently and securely on a global basis.&quot;Visa B2B Connect is a distributed ledger based, non-card platform. Its unique distributed-ledger based architecture enables significantly shorter transaction times, from weeks to one-to-two days,&quot; The Financial reported in mid-May. Using blockchain architecture, Visa is ready to offer global banks a new alternative for processing high-value transactions. &quot;B2B Connect's digital identity greatly reduces the opportunity for fraud that might otherwise exist with checks, ACH and wire transfers today, while also helping companies remain compliant as part of the regulated financial ecosystem,&quot; Kevin Phalen, global head of Visa Business Solutions at Visa, stated last October while discussing B2B Connect's product details.  Seven months later, it's close to launching B2B Connect, providing investors with another reason to like Visa stock. The Big Reason to Own MastercardBigger isn't necessarily better.While Mastercard's market cap is 28% less than Visa and its operating margins are slightly lower -- 56% compared to 60% -- the fact that's it smaller makes it nimbler than its bigger rival allowing it to move more quickly when it spots an opportunity. &quot;It's smaller in size than its rival Visa but its relative size makes it more nimble, winning the new Apple Card business for example. The global market for electronic payments will continue to grow and MasterCard will continue to grow with it, particularly internationally where a majority of the growth is expected to be generated,&quot; Marketocracy founder Ken Kam wrote in May as part of an interview with analyst John Archer. Archer, whose Tabernacle Fund's largest holding is Mastercard at 14% of the portfolio, believes the stock's current intrinsic value is $230. However, Archer isn't selling because only 10% of the $22 trillion global market for payments is card-based, providing Mastercard with a long runway for growth. Mastercard might be smaller than Visa, but that doesn't make it equally attractive over the long haul.      The Verdict Although I've written more about Visa in this article, there's little difference between the two stocks. The only metric besides having higher operating margins that might tilt the decision in Visa's favor is its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.6, about half that of Mastercard.  As the largest (Visa) and second-largest payment processors in the world, if you don't mind paying 17 times sales, they're both excellent long-term holds.  At the time of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-05,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly getting into cryptocurrency. The news hasn't done much for FB stock, which has other issues to deal with. Facebook stock fell more than 7% on June 3 amid news of an Federal Trade Commission investigation.Source: Shutterstock That probe, which mirrors a similar Department of Justice investigation into Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is the big story for now … and it probably should be. But Facebook's intentions for cryptocurrency are intriguing. The question is whether they really matter to the FB stock price.After all, a number of companies have tried to create value in and around cryptocurrency and blockchain. Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) and Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) notably pivoted to the space. Even IBM (NYSE:IBM) has repeatedly touted its efforts in blockchain. None of the efforts have done anything, so far, to drive profits and all three stocks have headed in the wrong direction.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Still, Facebook might be different. Its existing base of over 2 billion users can amplify its efforts. The company -- regulatory and reputational worries aside -- will instantly add credibility to the technology. And Facebook is big enough to put money behind the effort and create confidence among users.For now, however, that latter fact is the problem. Facebook is large. In fact, it's huge. FB stock has a market value of $478 billion. At the moment, it's hard to see cryptocurrency moving the needle on that figure even if Facebook's efforts will be fun to watch. Facebook and CryptoNews has been dribbling out about Facebook's intentions for several weeks. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the company had held discussions with several of the big players in cryptocurrency. That even included the Winklevoss twins, who famously sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of the platform, and who have made several unsuccessful efforts to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Two days later, the BBC reported that Facebook planned to launch its cryptocurrency, referred to as GlobalCoin, in the first part of 2020. The FT returned this past weekend with a story that the company had held initial talks with the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission about whether its coin would be regulated by that agency. (The CFTC generally regulates futures, which drive much of current trading in bitcoin. Whether a cash-based Facebook cryptocurrency would fall under its auspices remains somewhat unclear.)All told, it does appear that Facebook, at least at the moment, plans to move ahead with GlobalCoin. Reports have suggested it would be a so-called stablecoin with its value pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar. Tether appears to be the most widely used stablecoin at the moment, but that cryptocurrency is embroiled in allegations that funds supposedly backing Tether were used to cover losses elsewhere.Facebook's balance sheet -= the company closed Q1 with $45 billion in cash and investments -- would negate any such worries. Its heft and reach would instantly add credibility. It's not hard to see users and businesses flocking to such an effort. Does Crypto Matter for FB Stock?The question is whether even a success is material to FB stock. Again, this is a company valued at almost half a trillion dollars. Tether has a &quot;market cap&quot; (as cryptocurrency traders define it) of just $3 billion.Certainly, Facebook could drive issuances of well over $3 billion. But what, exactly, does that mean for the social network's profits? It's not clear at the moment but the answer very well could be nothing. The point of Facebook's GlobalCoin might not necessarily be to make money by, say, taking a cut of transactions ala' Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA). It might instead simply be a way to increase engagement or keep engagement from eroding, which would pressure advertising sales.Even if Facebook were to become a payment processor via its coin, it's not clear how successful it would be - or how much money it might make. The online payments space already is highly competitive, with Visa, Mastercard, PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), and many others. Online shopping -- and online money transfer -- is not a particularly difficult experience at this point.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Monster Growth Facebook could leverage its user base into driving adoption of its coin -- but even several billion dollars in annual transactions, at a 1% or even 2% fee, doesn't really impact earnings all that much. That might be revenue of a couple hundred million dollars annually, albeit at high margins. But Facebook is likely to earn over $20 billion in 2019 alone. Is Facebook Stock a Buy?That said, there is a bull case for Facebook stock. I argued last month that the company had a path to retake record highs next year … I still believe that's the case. For all the coverage of the company's various scandals, they've had no discernible impact on revenue growth or advertiser demand. FB stock remains reasonably cheap. Better monetization of Instagram and WhatsApp will follow in coming years.To be sure, there are near-term risks. The new, clearer, regulatory worries may keep a lid on Facebook stock, though I agree with others who believe the likelihood of a breakup is minimal. Tech stocks on the whole are selling off, though the declines in FB and GOOGL are in part a cause of that sell-off. (Those declines also are pushing indices lower.)Longer-term, I still believe Facebook stock has upside. And cryptocurrency may, at some point, be part of those gains. But the case here is based on a sober understanding of the company's role in online advertising - and requires an intense focus on its user growth and engagement. Cryptocurrency will be fun to watch but it's not going to matter much to the FB stock price.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-06-06,"Since peaking at around $80 a share, Square, Inc. (NYSE: SQ) is stuck in a downtrend. Selling accelerated and failed to hold the $70 when, on May 5, the company reported first-quarter results. Square issued a second-quarter outlook that trailed consensus estimates, which wasn't a great thing for Square stock.Source: Via SquareInvestors need to know what changed to slow the company's previously strong momentum. Trading recently at around $63, the stock has unfavorably high valuation multiples. So, given the revised second-quarter guidance, what is Square stock worth? New Product Highlights in First QuarterThrough the first quarter, Square enhanced its omnichannel offering by launching the Square Online store.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets By syncing online and in-person data, seller items, orders, inventory, and prices are all synced automatically. This strengthens Square's ecosystems and the value of the seller tools. And by launching the Square Online store globally, the company expands its addressable market. It launched the online store in the United States, the UK, Canada, and Australia.In Japan, Square launched Square Stand and a Square contact person chip reader. This enables sellers to pay wirelessly or through a wire. Processing payments is as easy as connecting a Square reader to an iPad device. Given the ease in quickly setting up Square payments, expect usage growing rapidly.Last but not least, the company's launch of Square Invoices should accelerate full-year revenue growth. The product targets a market opportunity worth $1 trillion in consumer invoices, and that is just the market size in the U.S. alone.Previously as a feature on Square's Dashboard, it is now a standalone mobile app. Already, Invoices processed over $5 billion in GPV in the last year through 350,000 active sellers. Due partly to the incredible growth opportunity here, Square raised its full-year outlook. OutlookSquare increased its fiscal-year 2019 revenue guidance by $60 million, to a range of $2.25 billion - $2.8 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $2.25 billion. With revenue at a 43% growth rate, markets may bid shares lower because it expected better numbers. Still, in the first quarter, GPV from mid-market sellers grew 50% from last year.Its Cash App performed strongly and contributed to Square's adjusted growth rate of 59% in Q1. The company will also build revenue momentum based on strong monthly active users. In the previous (Q4) period, Square reported 15 million monthly active users. And in the last quarter, Cash Card increased engagement and monthly active customers. Positive CatalystsThe success of Square's Cash App is a positive catalyst. Cash App volume grew by 2.5 times in the first quarter. Add the positive impact of network effects and engagement growth and investors will have little doubt that revenue growth could exceed the company's forecast for the year.Look for the cost of acquiring monthly active users falling, thanks to network effects. Add instant deposit, Cash Card, instant deposit, P2P funded through credit cards, and cryptocurrency as just a few Square offerings and markets will realize Square may potentially report yearly results exceeding its forecast.Square's EBITDA guidance of over 60% year-over-year growth will result from disciplined cost management. Its consistent performance is another positive catalyst. Management forecasted EBITDA growth outpacing adjusted revenue growth this year. This is what it accomplished annually in the last five years. Effective Marketing CampaignsSquare will build upon its strong net promoter scores in many of its international markets by running brand campaigns. Its campaign in the U.K. in progress is already reaching the intended audience across its portfolio. As its brand awareness grows, Square will take a portion of processing transactions associated with household spending, and as its market share grows, so too will its revenue.Investors have plenty of credit card services to consider. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) is valued with a market cap of $128 billion, nearly five times bigger than that of Square. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) has a $352 billion market cap but the stock also trades at lower valuation multiples. Still, Visa is so large that its revenue growth will not match that of Square's rate. The Bottom Line on Square StockSquare's second-quarter results will lag estimates but the company expects higher full-year results. Instead of bidding the stock higher, the market dumped the stock instead. Wall Street analysts are bullish on Square stock and have an average price target of $85 (per Tipranks). If it gets there, the stock has an upside of 35%.When Square reports next quarter, an earnings beat should send the stock to at least $80. This would bring the stock back to its March high.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-07,"Cash -- one of the last vestiges of the analog era -- is steadily going out of style. This broad trend only helps credit card companies with mass appeal, such as Visa (NYSE:V). Although you'll often hear personal finance gurus urging their listeners to cut up their plastic, let's be real: Americans love debt-based consumerism. That simple fact should lift Visa stock northward on a longer-term basis.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrAdding to the bullish case, this scenario is playing out exactly as I stated. On a year-to-date basis, V stock is up nearly 28%. Credit card rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is enjoying a similar burst in sentiment, gaining a massive 38% year-to-date. Compare these performances to the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is up only 14% YTD after suffering volatility since May.And what is the source of this volatility? Just turn on the TV to find out. A few weeks back, everybody was scrambling to decipher underlying signals within the deteriorating complex of U.S.-China relations. Now, President Trump has his eyes focused on Mexico, threatening painful tariffs unless they control migrant inflows. But while all this is going on, the Visa stock price remains elevated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Like our own Ian Bezek stated in October 2017, V stock is surprisingly recession-resistant. Visa doesn't assume credit risk in the way that a mortgage lender might.Plus, the world community is undergoing a transition to financial digitalization. One of physical cash's final holdouts, Japan, is slowly but steadily shifting toward a cashless society. As a western ally and the world's third-biggest economy, converting Japan is huge for companies like Square (NYSE:SQ). Through natural synergies, you can also expect a swing higher in the Visa stock price.Yet I'm cautious, and here's why: Visa Stock Has Serious VulnerabilitiesThe last time I wrote about V stock, I compared the underlying company to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Making headlines earlier this year, Apple announced its foray into the plastic industry.However, I felt that Visa's broad base, and its decades of expertise in the arena gave it the advantage. I'm still sticking to that narrative.But since writing that piece, the U.S. is on the verge of entering a two-front trade war. Going toe-to-toe with China is bad enough. Simultaneously antagonizing Mexico is a very risky political move for the Trump administration. Obviously, if the situation worsens, it will threaten several jobs.And that's why with this new information, I'm hesitant on Visa stock. Earlier, Bezek mentioned that company shares mitigated losses better in the 2008 fallout relative to many other stocks. That suggests the American consumer is much more resilient than we give it credit for.But another scenario is that consumers used whatever tools at their disposal to keep the rusted train going. Consumer debt statistics indicate that, contrary to the &quot;recovery&quot; narrative, most Americans are deeply troubled. People with credit cards average over $5,800 in debt.Some states are much worse. For instance, Alaska has the most average credit card debt at $8,500 per cardholder. Iowa features the lowest, but still maintains a staggering $5,155 of plastic debt.All you need to do when considering the risk to the Visa stock price is read between the lines. People have no reason to hold such mind-boggling balances in their high-interest rate cards other than cash flow purposes. In order to make ends meet, Americans individually kick the can down the road.V stock has been rising because we've had plenty of road to cover. But these new geopolitical headwinds are too ominous to ignore. Excessive Bad Loans Cloud V StockAdmittedly, our spiraling relations with foreign economic partners got me to question the true state of our own economy. After all, President Trump won because he tapped into the actual fears affecting voters.In other words, Trump called Obama-era data &quot;fake news.&quot; Millions believed him.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Don't Care About Tariffs Now, Trump as President is changing his tune. Rather than fake news, positive labor reports and consumer sentiment represent confirmation that his policies work. But the reality is that Trump was probably right the first time. Certainly, rising consumer debt levels support the pessimistic narrative.What bothers me more is that this narrative has other confirming indicators. For instance, big banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are only gaining due to issues involving monetary policy. However, they are not generating revenue growth from activities like lending or consulting.Put differently, Americans are not taking on good debt. By that, I mean debt for the purpose of starting new businesses or ventures. Instead, we're seeing an increase in bad debt, or liabilities associated with purchasing junk.What I'm talking about probably won't impact the Visa stock price immediately. But considering that it's so elevated right now, I'd stay on the sidelines with the powder keg dry.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-10,"Compared to 2017 and the bulk of 2018, Square (NYSE:SQ) has been disappointing of late. SQ stock is still down 36% from its early-October high, unable to hold on to its rebound gains from earlier this year. Indeed, shares are down nearly 18% from March's average price, largely thanks to a slowdown in revenue growth.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)Investors and analysts alike, however, may have been imposing unfair expectations on the company. The bigger it gets, the tougher the comparisons become. Traders revolted at the initial sign of a headwind.It was an inevitable development for Square, though, just as it's an inevitable development for most young tech companies that are building a business on a good idea. Eventually, an organization grows out of its high-growth phase and moves into the mature phase of its life.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThat unexpected graduation upended this name, but the subsequent weakness is an opportunity to step into SQ stock on the cheap while the market reframes what Square should be at this stage. Tough Act to FollowThe fact that it was able to launch at all is impressive in and of itself.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows When Square debuted in 2009, Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) was arguably the king of the online payment world, while players like Visa (NYSE:V) and First Data (NYSE:FDC) seemingly held a firm lead on their piece of the payments market.Square's founders Jim McKelvey and Jack Dorsey, who also runs Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), saw an unmet need, though. With 23 million sole proprietors in the United States in addition to millions more small shops being ignored or poorly served by the credit card industry, allowing them a simple and cost-effective means of accepting card payments has proven to be a huge opportunity.Several numbers confirm the idea, not the least of which is the 350% advance SQ stock has dished out since the end of 2016. Accelerating double-digit growth made for a convincing bullish argument.Things began to change in the latter part of last year. The pace of growth began to slow and outright decline in the first quarter of this year, from a pace of 51% to 43%.Still, it's growth that most other companies envy, and growth that, from most other companies, would have investors salivating. Not Square, though. The chatter surrounding this storied stock -- and it is a true &quot;story stock&quot; -- has been all about the breakneck speed of its sales growth, en route to a swing to a real GAAP profit. When the pace slowed, the story crumbled.Take a closer look at the company, however. The future still looks amazingly bright, and the market may be on the verge of mentally repositioning Square as something other than a story stock that needs unsustainable growth rates to drive unsustainable rallies.Once that dust fully settles, SQ stock should become a solid, even if less volatile, prospect. Square OutlookIt's a reality that hasn't eluded analysts even in the midst of some rather dramatic investors panic.Though traders have driven shares down to their current price near $65, the consensus target remains just under $83. That's still relatively close to its peak consensus target of around $88 in December of last year, before another wave of selling forced some analysts to at least acknowledge current price action.Driving that rather persistent optimism is a growth streak that's projected to remain in place for the foreseeable future. While the relative, comparison pace is slowing, on an absolute basis, the growth train continues to roll.By the third quarter of this year, analysts expect positive GAAP earnings.It's not just wishful thinking either. Square has catalysts in the cards. Chief among them is ongoing growth of its Cash App. Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal reiterated this week the possibility that it could propel SQ stock higher, after saying in March: &quot;Square's vision is that consumers rely on Cash App, instead of a bank account, for services like bill pay, budgeting, investing, and lending, in addition to storing, spending, and sending money.&quot;Instinet's Dan Dolev is bullish too, though for a different reason. He also noted in March: &quot;With over 80% of large-sellers self-onboarding, we expect this positive trend to continue,&quot; highlighting Square's traction with bigger businesses. Bottom Line for SQ StockInvestors are slowly but surely figuring out the future can't look like the past no matter how successful the company is. Though it's taking time, the adjustment is being made.  * Walmart Stock Looks Poised to Reach $120 This Year That's not to suggest such an adjustment is made in a straight line. Surely many traders will remain stuck in the old paradigm, while others are already valuing Square like an old-school name. It's a paradigm that sets the stage for more volatility. That volatility is being exacerbated by the overall market's uncertainty.The fog is lifting though, and what's starting to emerge is a company that's still easy to own even if it's not putting on a fireworks show.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-11,"The dominance of the Visa (NYSE:V) payment network continues to drive volumes and market share to the company. In this increasingly important industry, Visa stock is benefiting from the fact that its payment network processes about 61.2% of U.S. transactions.In a world that's using less cash, the credit-card industry will prosper, enabling Visa stock to remain a winner over the long-term. However, the question about V stock is not if it will go up, but if it remains a better buy than its peers.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019  Visa Stock Will Rise With Its IndustryIt's steady as she goes for Visa stock. Bolstered by the company's dominant market share and the continuing march towards a cashless society, V stock is continuing its slow, sustained move higher. After flirting with single-digit prices during the 2008 financial crisis, it began to move steadily higher. Today, it has risen more than 15-fold since that time. The Visa stock price has now surged to around $170.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs both myself and others have pointed out, Visa stock remains pricey. The company's growth and favorable business conditions have taken the forward price-earnings (PE) ratio of V stock above 27.4. However, the average PE ratio of V stock over the last five years is 32.9. Estimated earnings growth of 16.5% this year and its average earnings increase of 20.84% per year over the previous five years has helped to support the high multiples of V stock.Moreover, even market selloffs have resulted in relatively mild pullbacks by V stock. Between late September and the week of Christmas, Visa stock price fell by a little bit less than 20%. However, its PE ratio remained well in the 20s during that time. Also, like most stocks, it quickly recovered. For this reason, I would not expect any significant declines in Visa stock price anytime soon. Given these factors, the long-term owners of V stock should continue to hold onto their shares. Moreover, even at these levels, those buying V stock face few risks. Visa Stock Versus Its PeersThe only reason to not buy  Visa stock may involve how well it compares to its key peers. Given the potential growth of cashless payments throughout the world, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP), and Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) should also generate double-digit profit growth, despite their smaller market shares.However, after looking at  card stocks' PE ratios and growth rates, it becomes clear that the market has been willing to support higher price-to-earnings-to growth (PEG) ratios for companies with higher market shares. Visa stock supports a PEG ratio of 1.9 versus only 1.75 for Mastercard. However, for this year, analysts, on average, predict Mastercard will report earnings growth of 17.4% versus only 16.5% for Visa. American Express, long a Warren Buffett favorite, trades at a PEG ratio of 1.57. AXP's expected profit growth comes in at only 10.8%. However, it has a much lower forward PE of around 13.5.Still, it is Discover Financial whose valuation stands out. Its PEG ratio comes in at only 0.7. It also supports a forward PE ratio of only about 8.2. Despite this single-digit multiple, analysts expect its profit to rise  12.4% this year.In some respects, DFS stock is cheap for a reason. It holds only a 2.2% share of card volumes, a decline from 2.3% last year. Visa remains the dominant player in this area, holding steady at 61.2%. However, in the current environment, all payment card companies will prosper.Moreover, since 2005, DFS has partnered with UnionPay, the dominant payment network in China. From a worldwide standpoint, UnionPay comes in second to only Visa on card volumes. The U.S.-China trade war may add a degree of uncertainty. However, with such an ally, DFS should continue to grow. The Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock will rise over the long-term, but some of its peers may fare better on a relative basis. V stock will likely remain expensive, but no major challenges have emerged to its dominance in the U.S. or to its double-digit earnings increases.When it comes to PEG ratios, Visa stock holds up well, slightly besting Mastercard and coming in only slightly higher than American Express's ratio. Still, value investors will find  Discover Financial stock to be a relative bargain, as it could help a growing, China-based peer enter the U.S. market.As a result, investors who don't want to pay the high multiple carried by V stock have other choices. However,the owners of V stock will continue to benefit from Visa's U.S. dominance and the continuing move to a more cashless society.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-06-12,"Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced it would offer a credit card to those with bad credit and credit services and electronic payment firms barely noticed. Visa (NYSE: V) shares closed recently at a new high as did MasterCard (NYSE:MA). But Amazon.com's card issuer, Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF) fell on the news. Still, both Synchrony and Amazon stock stand to benefit from this initiative and shares for both companies will react positively as customers sign up for this credit card.Source: Shutterstock The rewards card, called Amazon Credit Builder, will target those who want to build their credit history. These include customers who either want to establish new credit or are recovering from a bad credit rating.Amazon.com is no stranger to the credit card business. Two years ago, it offered a Visa card with 5% cash back. With this new card, Prime members get the 5% back on purchases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Credit Builder also gives the cardholder the ability to track their credit score. The credit details are displayed on a TransUnion CreditView Dashboard at no charge. By showing score changes over time, Amazon is helping the cardholder learn how to improve the credit score. This removes the need to rely on Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX) and more importantly, the service has no extra costs. Prime Subscriptions and Amazon StockThe new credit offering gives customers another incentive to have an Amazon Prime subscription. But the online retailer offers bigger reasons to be a member. For the current second quarter, the company is working to turn its Prime free Two-Day Shipping into a free One-Day Shipping program.This feat is possible because of the company's back-end fulfillment and logistics network. Still, Amazon needs to invest in this area to achieve this same-day delivery goal. It plans to spend $800 million in the second quarter.So, if one day Amazon brings One-Day shipping down to one or two-hour shipping, it will have a huge advantage over retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT) or Walmart (NYSE:WMT). In the last holiday season, Target could not offer more than getting online shoppers to drive to the store to physically pick-up the order.But even though Walmart is planning to launch in-home grocery delivery in three cities this fall, the food business something Amazon will build through its Whole Foods division. For now, growing the Whole Foods business depends on developing the physical storefront experience. Prime Subscriptions GrowJust as Costco (NASDAQ:COST) enjoys high profit margins through membership fees, Amazon Prime is of strategic importance. Last year, more people signed up for Prime than any year before. The more time people spend watching videos and listening to music, the more they are likely to renew their membership year after year. Telling friends about the great service encourages more people to sign up.When Amazon Web Services brought in an astonishing $30 billion in annualized revenue, the company's credit card initiative appears insignificant at best.Yet everything counts; the operating margin grew by 320 basis points. It may re-invest the cash to fulfill infrastructure needs while finding further efficiencies. The more profitable the business becomes the better programs like Prime get. And the more incentive there is, the more likely Amazon may win customers who happen to have bad credit and need to rebuild their credit score. Price TargetAnalysts on Wall Street have an average price target that is 20% above the recent $1,860 share price. Per Tipranks, the average price target is $2,242. Supporting this price target is a 10-year DCF Growth Exit Model. If Amazon keeps growing revenue by at least 10% annually, the stock has plenty of upside for investors.Amazon's high valuations do not make much sense to the conservative investor but the market knows better. In every type of business, the online retailer enters, it re-defines the business process and eventually dominates the sector. Your TakeawayShares of Amazon stock are already up nearly 10% in the last week thanks to a rebound in the stock market. Though the growth prospects suggest the stock may run higher, investors may still want to wait for a dip in the stock before buying.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-13,"While Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has gained a respectable 12.6% in the past year, that performance pales in comparison to the previous 12-month periods, when SQ stock nearly doubled each year.Source: Via SquareNot only that, the shares have also been disappointing when looking at other companies in the space. Consider that the annual return for Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is a sizzling 91% while PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock has risen 37% and Visa (NYSE:V) is up 28%.Now the payments industry holds tremendous opportunity. One estimate is that the size is a whopping $110 trillion on a global basis. No doubt, technologies like cloud computing, mobile and AI (artificial intelligence) will continue to be disruptive forces.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet despite all this, I still think there are some nagging risks with Square stock. Let's take a look: SQ Stock: GrowthSQ continues to grow at a fast pace. In the latest quarter, net revenues jumped by 43% and adjusted revenues spiked by 59%. The company also increased its full-year guidance.Yet there are some potential issues with the growth story. For example, gross payment volume increased by only about 27% to $22.6 billion. The Street, on the other hand, was looking for $22.8 billion.As well, the U.S. economy is showing some signs of weakness, as seen with a drop-off in job gains and sluggishness with retail sales. Businesses also appear to be pulling back on making investments because of the uncertainty regarding trade, especially with China.  * 7 Stocks to Buy As They Hit 52-Week Lows If there is a recession or a serious slowdown, SQ could take big heat. The reason is that a big chunk of the company's revenue come from small businesses. And yes, they generally are disproportionately effected during economic hard times.According to Square's 10-K filing: &quot;Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. In addition, if more of our sellers cease to operate, this may have an adverse impact not only on the growth of our payments services but also on our transaction and advance loss rates, and the success of our other services.&quot; Square Stock: ValuationEven though SQ stock is 30% off its 52-week high -- which was tipped in September -- the valuation is still far from cheap. Note that the forward price-to-earnings ratio is roughly 63x and the shares trade at about 8.3x sales.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Now a premium is deserved for a company with Square's strong platform, brand and customer base. But then again, if the growth rate starts to falter, there could easily be more downside. We already saw evidence of this in the latest earnings report. SQ Stock: Managerial BandwidthA key part of Square's strategy has been to add more and more services on its platform. This has not only provided more convenience for customers but has expanded the market opportunity. Note that this strategy has been critical in keeping up the overall growth rate as payments volumes have been trailing off.But there is a risk to this strategy -- that is, it increases the complexity of the organization. The services span diverse categories like invoices, deposits, inventory, appointments, website hosting, marketing, employee management, business loans and so on. All of these are in highly competitive markets.Besides, CEO Jack Dorsey is essentially a part-time CEO, as he also heads up Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). So it will certainly get more challenging for him to manage SQ as the business scales.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

Of the 40 largest U.S.-listed stocks by market capitalization, only Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) sport higher valuations.Source: Shutterstock And yet V stock certainly seems to merit a premium valuation. Few large-capitalization stocks can match its near-term growth prospects. Long-term opportunities come in several forms: lower use of cash worldwide, international expansion, and a move into business-to-business (B2B) offerings.Does an investor follow the Warren Buffett maxim that it's &quot;far better to own a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,&quot; as I argued back in 2017? Or does valuation matter, particularly in a bull market seemingly running on fumes?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor now, Visa stock seems a worthwhile bet. But investors probably have to temper their expectations. The next decade is not going to look like the last one. The Incredible Rise in the Visa Stock PriceLooking backwards, investors certainly missed a huge opportunity in Visa stock. Over the past ten years, shares have returned 953%, not including an admittedly modest dividend. Those gains haven't come just because of the bull market either. In 2009, the company earned 81 cents per share (adjusting for the company's 2015 stock split). A decade ago, the stock (again, on a split-adjusted basis) traded for $16-plus, implying a P/E multiple right at 20x.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Expects to Soar for the Rest of 2019 Relative to 2019 expectations, the multiple now sits at 31x. And there are two ways to look at that expansion. The first is that the incredible gains in the Visa stock price are coming mostly from higher earnings. Based on the Street's expectations for 2019, V should climb nearly 500% from 2009 levels.The second, however, is a more difficult question: can the multiples assigned V stock really go much higher? This is a much larger company, which makes percentage growth more difficult to achieve. Yet investors now are paying 50%-plus more for the same dollar of earnings. As impressive as Visa's opportunities are, it's tough to argue that its growth potential is better now than it was a decade ago.Obviously, the market today is in much better shape than in June 2009, when it was just three months removed from financial crisis lows. But that's kind of the point: Visa's earnings multiples can't expand much more without the broad market moving higher.In that scenario, earnings growth still can drive returns -- again, profits are expected to rise 15%-plus in 2020. But roughly 16% annual returns (including the dividend) might seem disappointing in the context of the recent performance. Is V Stock the Best Play?As incredible as the performance of Visa stock seems, there's something more incredible: Mastercard. Visa has returned nearly 1,000% in a decade, yet V shares have underperformed their rival over that span. In fact, MA has been the better pick over one, three, and five-year periods as well. Its 10-year return is a staggering 1,460%.At the moment, MA actually is slightly more expensive on an earnings basis than V stock. Mastercard has greater exposure to non-U.S. payments, and thus, at least in theory, more room for growth. And while past performance doesn't guarantee future performance, the better returns from Mastercard shares are at least worth considering.Of course, Visa and Mastercard aren't the only two stocks in the space, either. Will Healy this month highlighted a potential opportunity in Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), which trades at a substantial discount to both V and MA despite significant potential risk in China. American Express (NYSE:AXP) has been an inconsistent performer, but offers value as well.The stories of the four stocks aren't the same; at the moment, it's foolish to argue that DFS or AXP should be treated like their rivals. But when considering V stock at these multiples, investors should at least keep an open mind toward other stocks in the space. Visa Looks Good, but Not GreatAt the least, the next decade for the Visa stock price is not going to look like the last decade. That's probably not surprising: a repeat of the 950%-plus gains would give Visa a market cap of some $4 trillion.But performance could be good -- and still far short of the standard Visa has set. Bear in mind that if V stock appreciated at 10.5% a year for the next decade, it would reach a $1 trillion market cap ten years from now. Maybe that's not unrealistic in a world where credit-card usage continues to rise. Plus, Visa's efforts in cross-border payments and B2B could bear fruit.Still, $1 trillion does seem like a big ask for returns that almost seem middling given the torrid performance of payment companies of late. And it shows the difficulty in Visa stock here. There's a path to a $1 trillion valuation, which is the good news. But whether 10%-plus a year is good enough for investors depends on their view of the markets and the competition.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Almost 30 firms have joined and Facebook hopes another 70 or more will enter the fold in the future.Read Facebook’s Project Libra white paper hereWho’s In:Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., the world’s largest payments networks, as well as PayPal Holdings Inc. are on board. For Visa and Mastercard, it’s a chance to offer the world of cryptocurrencies the same services they provide in card payments. All three companies know the challenges of building a network and can offer expertise in encouraging consumers to use the instrument and cajoling merchants into accepting it.Companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and Spotify Technology SA keep millions of credit cards on file, and they risk losing customers when people get a new card or number. E-commerce firms also pay higher “card not present” rates when processing payments, so anything that can reduce these expenses is welcome.“Libra has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional financial networks and new digital currency technology, while reducing the costs for everyone,” said Peter Hazlehurst, head of payments at Uber.International companies, including e-commerce firm MercadoLibre Inc. and telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc, signed onto Libra, too. Blockchain technology and stablecoins are potential solutions for the messy world of cross-border payments, which suffers from delays and high costs.Who’s Out:Large banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., already have their own payments businesses that reap billions of dollars in fees. With regulators still deciding how to treat cryptocurrencies, banks and investment firms are treading cautiously.So far, no large brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Target Corp. and Walmart Inc., are taking part. The industry is always interested in lowering the cost of accepting payments, but traditional merchants have historically been hesitant to accept cryptocurrencies due to volatility and lack of consumer adoption.The largest U.S. technology companies, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc., are noticeably absent. Many of these firms have their own digital payments businesses and some are experimenting with blockchain technology. Apple has poured scorn on Facebook for repeated privacy missteps and other big tech firms are trying to avoid being associated with the social-media giant.“This is very early -- 27 organizations right now, 100 by the time we launch,” David Marcus, head of the Facebook blockchain team that’s spearheading the project, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “And by that time, I definitely expect to see banks in there, I definitely expect to see other large technology companies and I definitely expect to see more diversity of organizations in terms of geographical distribution.”Square Inc.

2019-06-18,Facebook (FB) announced today plans for a new cryptocurrency project called Libra.,Buy Facebook (FB) Stock Amid Cryptocurrency Craze?
2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. unveiled plans for a new, global financial system with a broad group of partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. on board to create a cryptocurrency it expects will one day trade much like the U.S. dollar and inject a new source of revenue.Called Libra, the new currency will launch as soon as next year and be what's known as a stablecoin–a digital currency that's supported by established government-backed currencies and securities. The goal is to avoid massive fluctuations in value so Libra can be used for everyday transactions across Facebook in a way that more volatile cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, haven’t been. The project is the culmination of a year-long effort as Facebook seeks to spur growth on its various platforms that already count more than 2 billion users. But it will also likely face skepticism–from regulators who already think Facebook has too much power and plays loose with digital privacy, and from those that are dubious of cryptocurrencies, which are known more for speculative investments and blackmarket commerce than for legitimate financial transactions.Read Facebook's white paper on Project Libra here.If successful, Libra could make Facebook a much bigger player in financial services.  Cryptocurrency firms have been trying to build cross-border, digital currencies on the blockchain to disrupt traditional banking and payments for a decade, but nothing has caught on at the scale of traditional money yet.Facebook, which announced the project with 27 partners, is already under wide-ranging regulatory scrutiny over how it handles users’ private data. Growth of its main platform has plateaued in some major markets and crypto payments would be a way to turn messaging – across WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram -- into a business that complements its advertising operation, which generates almost all of its revenue. Facebook shares gained early Tuesday as analysts saw the move as a potentially major new profit stream. “We view Facebook’s introduction of the Libra currency as a potential watershed moment for the company and global adoption of crypto,” wrote Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who has an outperform rating and $250 price target on Facebook shares. “In terms of scale and importance, we believe this new financial infrastructure could be viewed similar to Apple’s introduction of iOS to developers over a decade ago.”Still, the announcement was met immediately with political opposition in Europe, with calls for tighter regulation of the company. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Libra shouldn’t be seen as a replacement for traditional currencies and called on the Group of Seven central bank governors to prepare a report on the project for their July meeting.“It is out of question’’ that Libra “become a sovereign currency,’’ Le Maire said in an interview on Europe 1 radio. “It can’t and it must not happen.”Read More: Facebook’s Cryptocurrency Project: Who’s In and Who’s OutFacebook Could Be for Crypto What AOL Was for Internet Adoption Crypto Chiefs Novogratz, Allaire Say Facebook Coin Bullish SignFacebook Rallies as Analysts Praise 'Watershed' Crypto Move France Calls for Central Bank Review of Facebook CryptocurrencyTo come anywhere close to matching the U.S. dollar for utility and acceptance, Libra will need to be widely trusted. So Facebook and its partners are mimicking how other currencies have been introduced in the past.“To help instill trust in a new currency and gain widespread adoption during its infancy, it was guaranteed that a country’s notes could be traded in for real assets, such as gold,” the companies wrote in a white paper. “Instead of backing Libra with gold, though, it will be backed by a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.&quot;The total number of Libra can change, and new digital coins can be issued whenever someone wants to exchange their Libra for an existing fiat currency, so the price shouldn’t fluctuate any more than other stable currencies, according to David Marcus, head of the Facebook blockchain team that’s spearheading the project.“It would make a scenario where there’s a run on the bank completely impossible, because we are backed one-for-one,” he said. Libra will also be audited, he added, an important step in an industry with limited transparency.Facebook has closely guarded its crypto plans for more than a year, though many of the details have already been reported by Bloomberg News and other outlets.Read about how Marcus tapped PayPal talent to build Facebook’s blockchain team.Marcus, who used to run Facebook Messenger, said Facebook plans to build a new digital wallet that will exist inside Messenger and its other standalone messaging service, WhatsApp. Once Libra is up and running, the currency and the digital wallet should make it easier for people to send money to friends, family and businesses through the apps. Libra will run on the so-called blockchain, a database that can use millions of computers to verify transactions, eliminating risks that come with information being held centrally by a single entity. Facebook created a new subsidiary, called Calibra, to build the new wallet and focus on the company’s blockchain efforts.Facebook's track record in payments and commerce has been spotty. A few years ago, it began letting people buy flowers or hail an Uber through its Messenger service. Those features have not been huge hits. In 2010, it began offering Facebook Credits, a way to buy virtual goods inside Facebook games. But in 2012 it scrapped Credits, and in 2013 it started working with third-party services like PayPal to process some payments. Facebook's revenue from &quot;payments and other service&quot; was less than 2% of total sales in 2018. When it finally arrives, Libra will be late to a party that’s been going on so long, many of the party-goers have either left or collapsed. Some past attempts to make coins usable for commerce, such as Bitcoin, haven’t widely caught on yet because price volatility mainly attracted traders and speculators. Predecessor stablecoins, like Tether, have been used by some traders to park funds in during times of high volatility, but have not been broadly adopted for commerce.Read more about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s early plans for cryptocurrency. U.S. regulations may represent another hurdle for Facebook. Creating a digital currency doesn’t just require buy-in from financial institutions who need to accept it, and consumers who need to trust it, but it requires approval from regulators, too. The Securities and Exchange Commission has shut down about a dozen businesses issuing their own tokens for violations of securities law. Marcus said Facebook has been in contact with regulators and central banks, but added that the company hasn’t received a “no-action” letter from the SEC yet. That would have safeguarded the project from regulatory action by the agency.One way Facebook hopes to appease regulators is through the Libra Association, a governing body tasked with making decisions about Libra. Firms including Visa and PayPal Holdings Inc. are part of the group. Marcus described these members as “co-founders,” and said they will have an equal say in how the cryptocurrency is managed.“Facebook will not have any special privilege or special voting rights at the association level,” said Marcus, the former president of PayPal. “We will have competitors and other players on top of this platform that will build competing wallets and services.”All Libra Association members are putting a minimum of $10 million into a reserve to help support the cryptocurrency’s value. This buy-in comes with voting privileges. However, the association’s governance structure is still in flux, and most of the group’s crucial decisions, including the creation of its charter, have not yet been decided, according to several members of the group. They asked not to be identified discussing private details.“Facebook will not have any special privilege”Libra’s timing could also pose challenges. Facebook is being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission over the company’s privacy practices. Some have called for the company to be broken up, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Asking consumers to put more trust in the social media giant, and giving Facebook a strong entry into the world of digital payments and banking, will likely draw further criticism.Opinion: Crypto-evangelists hoped digital currencies would challenge Big Tech’s data control. Zuckerberg has other plans.The company plans to keep financial data gathered from Libra users separate from Facebook user data. That’s why Facebook’s digital wallet will exist under the Calibra subsidiary, which will house user transaction data on separate servers, Marcus said. If a WhatsApp user uses her Calibra wallet to send money to a friend or pay a retailer, those interactions won’t be stored alongside her social-media profile.“There’s a clear distinction between Calibra and what Calibra has access to, and what Facebook Inc. has access to,” Marcus said. “It’s very clear that people don’t want their financial data from an account to be comingled with social data or to be used for other purposes.”(Updates with analyst comment, French finance minister, and shares.)&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer Surane.To contact the authors of this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netOlga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netJulie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Alistair Barr at abarr18@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Wants Its Cryptocurrency to One Day Rival the Greenback

2019-06-18,"Visa (NYSE:V) is up more than 25% over the past year, stoked in part by Federal Reserve rate hikes of 2018 that have translated into higher profit margins for credit card companies. The overall fundamental strength of the company has also been the catalyst behind the Visa stock returns.Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrThe world's largest retail electronic payments network, Visa, is expected to report earnings in late July. There could be some volatility and profit-taking in Visa in the coming weeks, especially as many other financial services firms also report in July.However, I'd encourage long-term investors who would like exposure to the sector to regard any dip in the share price as an opportunity to add Visa stock to their portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today  Long-Term Visa Stock StrengthsRobust Fundamental Numbers: Visa is a quality blue-chip company with a $370 billion market cap. Since going public in 2008, Visa has rewarded shareholders continuously.The group does not issue credit cards or lend money. Instead, the company operates as an &quot;intermediary,&quot; charging a fee on each of the 150 million transactions its network handles every day.Visa has three sources of revenue:  * Service revenues (for services provided to card issuers for the use of Visa products);  * Data processing revenues (fees Visa collects for the authorization, settlement, or clearing); and  * International transaction revenues (for cross-border and currency conversion transactions).On April 24, Visa posted better than expected results for Q2 2019. Revenue for the quarter ending March 31 was $5.5 billion, an 8% growth year-over-year (YoY).Earnings per share (EPS) also increased to $1.31, a 17% YoY increase. As a result of robust growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, the company also increased its outlook for the year.As one of the major credit and debit card processors, Visa has strong pricing power and a good profit margin that stands at over 54%. Visa's leadership position in the industry requires financial flexibility so that the management can continue the growth-centric steps. Its current ratio, which measures Visa's ability to pay off short-term liabilities with its current assets, is a healthy 1.6, compared to the industry average of 2.4.In fact, Visa and its long-time archrival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) can be said to have a duopoly in the cards network sector. Both companies collect transaction fees for without bearing credit risk and control a majority of the digital payment infrastructure. And there does not seem to be much threat to the dominance of either company.Visa's sales numbers are forecast to grow over 10% in 2019 and 2020. Overall, Wall Street expects Visa's profitability, high margins, robust cash flow and healthy financial metrics to continue in the coming quarters, too -- a fact that should bring higher prices for V stock.Mobile Payments Space: Many of us have already paid for a purchase with our smartphones at least once as mobile payments are fast becoming a convenient and swift method to pay bills or make transfers. Analysts expect the global market to reach $4.5 trillion by 2023.The most widely used transaction methods include contactless payments without entering the credit card PIN number at the point-of-sale or using a smartphone to pay a merchant or even a person such as a friend or family member, i.e., peer-to-peer (P2P) payments.If you are looking at ways to benefit from this trend, Visa may be a solid company to consider. It's been boosting its mobile payment offerings. As early as 2011, the group took a stake in Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco-based credit card processing fintech, which was founded in 2009. There are rumors that Visa may end up acquiring Square.Its other strategic investments include Stripe and Marqeta as well as It's currently bidding to buy Earthport,a British payments company, that facilitates money transfer services across borders.Over the past decade, smartphones have become a part of our daily lives and it would not be wrong to expect mobile payments to enter our daily lives in a big way. In other words, as more consumers tap to pay or download an app to transfer money, Visa investors are likely to reap the rewards. What Could Derail Visa Stock?Short-term Technical Analysis and Price Charts: Year-to-date, Visa is up 28%. So, in the next few weeks, there might be some profit taking. As a result of the recent impressive run-up in the stock price, short-term technical indicators have become somewhat over-extended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Visa's technical message has also become &quot;overbought.&quot;Leading up to its earnings report in late July, Visa stock could trade sideways for several weeks and even have a pullback toward the low-$160's or even mid-$150's level, where the stock is likely to find major support.Visa stock's beta is 0.98, which means its volatility on average mimics that of the broader market. Therefore if the industry or the broader market declines as the companies release earnings, Visa may also be adversely affected.Investors may consider waiting on the sidelines if they do not currently have any positions open in these tech stocks.If you already own Visa shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.Current shareholders may also consider hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with July 19 expiry could be appropriate as straight put purchases are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find Visa stock to be a compelling buy candidate and by the end of 2020, I'd expect the shares to reach $180.Competition in the Mobile Payment Payments Space: The fintech revolution is evolving and the entire payments industry is growing fast. In addition to Visa, several other U.S. companies are leading the mobile-payment race that requires cutting-edge technology. In October 2014, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced Apple Pay which has now become one of the dominant digital payment apps in the U.S.In the P2P space, investors love PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) which owns the popular Venmo app. The app has over 25 million users and is ahead of its closest competitors -- Apple's Pay Cash, Square's Cash App, and Zelle, which is owned by Early Warning Services, a private fintech company.If there are mixed earnings reports or important news from Visa's competitors hit the wires, there may be short-term volatility or decline in the stock. For example, if any of Visa peers were to issue an earnings warning, due to a potential slowdown in consumer spending in the U.S. or globally, then Visa shares could also be adversely affected in the near-term.However, Visa is a solid company with continued growth prospects in mobile payments. Therefore small price dips on daily headlines should not keep long-term investors up at night.In general, whenever Visa stock price has a correction, such as the one it experienced in late 2018, the shares come back rather quickly, only to make a new high in several months. Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa stock is a fundamentally sound stalwart investment with further growth prospects, profitability, leadership in the respective market, stability, and proactive management -- factors that are likely to translate into a strong balance sheet and robust bottom line in the rest of the decade.There are two important secular trends currently affecting the payments sector in the U.S. as well as many other countries, i.e., payment transactions are increasingly moving to mobile and digital payments are surpassing cash payments. As the industry is growing and being transformed, Visa stock may indeed provide a solid long-term investment for many shareholders.Investors who are interested in financial services, but do not want to commit all their capital to a single stock such as Visa may also consider investing in various exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) that have Visa as a holding, including iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG), ISE Mobile Payments ETF (NYSEARCA:IPAY), or Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:VGT).As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Facebook Inc.’s planned cryptocurrency is going to need more friends to work.On Tuesday, the social media giant announced it had signed up 27 partners to develop and administer Libra, a digital medium of exchange for use on its apps and beyond. Uber Technologies Inc., Spotify Inc., Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are all taking part – but there’s a notable absence of banks, large retailers and consumer goods companies, whose massive marketing budgets are the staple of ad agencies worldwide.This matters because Facebook is, above all else, an advertising platform. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has to prove that Libra will deliver more value to brands than their current advertising setup. Judging by this initial list of partners, a lot of firms appear unconvinced. The company wants to sign up a total of 100 by the time the coin starts next year. It will need every one of them, and more.For Zuckerberg, the best possible outcome is that the coin, which is tied to a basket of foreign currencies, keeps both users and brands locked into the Menlo Park, California-based firm’s ecosystem.In theory, a user might receive a token for watching an ad, which they then spend on something they have also seen advertised on Facebook. The company selling the product could then use that token to buy more ad space on the social network, and so the cycle would start anew. That would mean that, even if Zuckerberg had to spend a little bit more to keep his users engaged, the money would ultimately flow back into his company’s coffers.For brands, the big question is just how much data from that process will Facebook be willing to share? You can see why companies might be wary about signing up on day one. Facebook and its family of apps – Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger – are already something of a walled garden when it comes to advertisers. They regularly complain that they have little visibility over what they call the journey of their customers: What ads did customers see before making a purchase or clicking through to a website? That anonymized data allows them to gauge whether an approach works or not.Many purchases happen on brands’ own websites right now, which is a problem for Facebook, since it doesn’t know itself when a user has decided to buy something. Knowing what exactly prompts a purchase would help the company target future ad campaigns more effectively. Starting its own digital wallet – Calibra – should allow it to plug that gap by inserting itself into the middle of consumers’ transactions.

2019-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s bid to create a new cryptocurrency has the potential to some day disrupt the global money system, analysts say. That’s if the new stablecoin, called Libra, can gain enough traction. In the meantime, they say, the plan probably means little for existing payments companies, like Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. -- which are all partners with Facebook.Shares of Mastercard, Visa and PayPal were mixed in mid-day Wednesday trading, ahead of the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. Facebook was down as much as 2.1%.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary about the new cryptocurrency:Cowen, George Mihalos, Jaret Seiberg“If successful – if – it could be very disruptive to the legacy interchange model developed by the networks and banks,” Cowen analysts wrote in a note. Libra may also be “price-eroding to processors,” and serve as a “shot across the bow to money remittance firms.”Their expectations aren’t all bad for existing financial firms. Libra offers potential to bring “new money” into the digital payments ecosystem, they said, which would add to the value stored in digital wallets, like PayPal’s. That may lead to greater account adoption and transaction growth, though costs will probably come under pressure, as “Libra will in many ways be akin to using cash.”They also warned that politics pose a risk to Facebook, with Congress likely to hold hearings in the next few months. “Washington has the power to end Libra and any other cryptocurrency,” they said, by denying access to the banking system, making converting the currency to cash impossible. Congress may also adopt legislation that imposes onerous anti-money laundering and public audit requirements.MoffettNathanson, Lisa EllisThe announcement may be “most important for the cryptocurrency world,” and less so for payments companies, Ellis wrote in a note after discussing the plan with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. “The cryptocurrency ecosystem may finally have a crypto-based system that – in design, at least – meets the major criteria required to make it functional for payments.”Libra has passed Visa, Mastercard and PayPal’s litmus tests, she said. They “see enough potential in the system to have raised their hands to participate – the first significant endorsement of the viability of cryptocurrencies from the incumbent payment ecosystem.”Citi, Ronit GhoseLibra “could be a big thing,” as the “support of Facebook and other internationally active partners will provide at minimum, a lot of public exposure to stablecoins and specifically to the Libra project.”Citi questions how regulators will respond to Libra.“For instance, Japan and Singapore consider coins pegged to a legal fiat as e-money,” while China, India and Indonesia ban dealing in virtual currencies, and Libra might fall under the SEC’s purview in the U.S. “The creation of ‘private money,’ even if fiat-linked, will raise a lot of political and regulatory debate.”Morgan Stanley, Brian Nowak, Betsy Graseck, James FaucetteMorgan Stanley analysts see little threat Libra will disrupt current global payment networks, noting Visa and Mastercard have “significant scale advantage, mature fraud detection capabilities and low cost structure.”They ask whether facilitating cross-border payments -- the only thing that’s not already present in today’s real-time banking system -- will be enough to differentiate Libra from other services, including Zelle and PayPal’s Venmo. They note that JPMorgan’s Interbank Information Network (IIN) is a blockchain that currently offers anti-money laundering and know-your-client (AML/KYC) services, with 259 banks and payments as a use case.KBW, Sanjay SakhraniThe initiative isn’t an immediate threat to payments companies, Sakhrani wrote in a note. “While the use case appears compelling for the underserved, adoption at a much broader scale will be required for Libra to emerge as a viable alternative to existing payment ecosystems.”Libra seems different than other cryptocurrencies, as it solves at least some issues, including volatility in value. Also, sponsorship from a large platform like Facebook may “help with the problem of adoption, although we believe that barriers to scale are likely still high, particularly in regions where a well-functioning payments ecosystem exists.”Wolfe Research, Darrin PellerThe most likely medium-term impact may be on “P2P, cross-border remittance, and the global underbanked,” Peller wrote in a note. He doesn’t see a near-term use case for Libra disrupting the payment system in “financially developed markets outside of remittance.”He sees opportunities for PayPal to fund Libra wallets/transactions and assist merchant acceptance, but adds that there are “long-term questions on potential pressure around e-commerce fees if Libra gains ubiquity.”To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Janet FreundFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Wall Street Sees Big Promise in Facebook Coin, With a Lot of Ifs"

The hearing titled &quot;Examining Facebook's Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations,&quot; comes after a number of Congressional lawmakers a day ago demanded that Facebook , which is leading the digital-payments venture, delay its attempt to roll out the cryptocurrency by the second half of 2020 as planned, while legislators review possible risks to consumers. House Financial Services Committee head Maxine Waters on Tuesday said Facebook &quot;is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.&quot; The social-media outfit is wrestling with privacy concerns following its Cambridge Analytica scandal. On Tuesday, Facebook said: &quot;We look forward to responding to lawmakers' questions as this process moves forward.&quot; Facebook has been meeting with regulators about its cryptocurrency plans, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported that Facebook officials have met with Securities and Exchange Commission as its prepares to kick off Libra Coin with more than two dozen partners, including payment company PayPal Inc.

2019-06-20,"It's been a good year for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The index has gained over 12% so far in 2019, reversing a 5.6% decline seen last year. 25 of the 30 Dow Jones stocks have risen so far this year.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal That admittedly makes it a bit tougher to find value in the index's components. But there are still a few Dow Jones stocks to buy left. Valuations for several components are reasonable -- and maybe too reasonable. And given that nearly all of the Dow Jones stocks promise ownership of quality businesses with long-term track records of creating value, there are still good stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: Shutterstock UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has been one of the Dow's losers this year, dropping about 1.5% YTD. That comes after UNH was one of the index's best stocks, rising from a little over $100 at the beginning of 2015 to $287 late last year.In the context of those gains, the recent pause makes some sense. Stock chart aside, there are some risks here. A Democratic win in the 2020 U.S. presidential election could augur more government intervention into healthcare -- and at the very least create some uncertainty for the stock. An increasing focus on drug rebates could pressure profits at the company's Optum unit, a key source of growth. Investors sold off UNH after a first quarter that was solid, but not quite up to the high bar UnitedHealth has set with recent performance.Still, I recommended UNH stock back in February, at a higher price -- and this still looks like an attractive long-term play. Valuation is reasonable, at less than 17x 2019 EPS estimates. Optum still is growing. UnitedHealth's market lead seems secure. Even more government involvement in healthcare seems likely to strengthen UnitedHealth's position rather than weaken it. Indeed, UNH stock did quite well in the wake of the passage of the Affordable Care Act.UNH almost certainly isn't going to come close to tripling over the next four-plus years, but there's still reason to see 10%+ total returns annually, at least. Chevron (CVX)Source: swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Shares of energy giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) fell back in April when the company announced a plan to buy out shale play Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). And CVX stock now trades at pretty much the same price it did after the decline.But, of course, Chevron isn't buying Anadarko. It dropped out after Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) made a higher offer for Anadarko. Chevron not only dumped a deal investors didn't like, but it received a cool $1 billion termination fee in the process.And yet CVX stock trades where it did after the deal was announced. Lower crude prices might be a factor, but Chevron's integrated model limits its exposure to oil prices (which is either good or bad news, depending on crude's trend).That alone suggests that CVX should be able to re-test recent highs around $126. And while that's only ~4% upside, admittedly, there's a nearly 4% dividend yield as well. Dividend aside, Chevron stock remains cheap, at less than 14x 2020 EPS estimates. And there might be another, better-liked, acquisition out there for Chevron to make.  * Check Out These 5 Fast-Growing Stocks to Buy Today CVX stock probably isn't going to be a huge gainer over the next six months -- or even the next few years. But there's a nice combination here of value, income and a company with options to improve shareholder returns going forward, no matter where oil prices go. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Shutterstock Chevron's fellow energy component, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), looks attractive here as well. XOM stock trades at a similar valuation on an earnings basis, but its 4.7% dividend yield is higher than that of CVX. For the world's largest energy company -- and like Chevron, one with impressive upstream/downstream diversification -- that type of yield is rare, and attractive.That said, there are some concerns. Most notably, XOM stock has been a terrible investment for basically this entire decade. The stock has risen 10%, total since the beginning of 2010. Investors have received healthy dividends, but Exxon stock still has badly underperformed the broader markets. More recent performance has been even worse: XOM stock touched its lowest levels in almost eight years back in December. And it's fallen over 25% from 2014 highs; even with dividends, shareholders are in the red over that period.That said, XOM stock is about as cheap as it ever gets. Its dividend yield hasn't been this high in over 20 years. Meanwhile, even amid weak trading the past few years, investors who have tried to time the bottom -- and sell at the top -- generally have been able to take some profits. Longer-term investors can get in cheap.It's not a perfect bull case, and as I wrote just a few months ago, XOM stock is not the play for those betting on higher oil prices. Those who are looking for stocks to buy for income and value, however, should look closely at both XOM and CVX. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock There are a number of stocks like Visa (NYSE:V) in the current market. The argument isn't over the health of the business, but rather the price investors are willing to pay. On a forward basis, Visa stock is second-most expensive of the Dow Jones stocks, just modestly behind Nike (NYSE:NKE).  * 5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy But as I wrote this week, Visa stock still seems worth paying up for. The staggering returns of the last decade -- nearly 1,000% including dividends -- aren't going to be replicated over the next ten years. But Visa still is growing earnings at a double-digit clip, with B2B (business-to-business), international, and domestic opportunities for more gains ahead. Visa stock isn't cheap, but a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; long-term play rarely is. Goldman Sachs (GS)Source: Shutterstock On the other side of the Dow's valuation spectrum is Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman Sachs stock is the cheapest in the Dow in terms of earnings, with its 7.4x forward multiple barely a quarter that of Visa and Nike.And there are reasons why GS stock is cheap. Trading revenue has been uneven. The company's investment banking business is losing share to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Investors on the whole aren't giving much credit to financials, with more traditional banks too trading at cheap multiples.That said, GS stock is not just cheap, but close to ridiculously so. Indeed, the stock trades below its tangible book value -- the net value of its assets. That implies essentially zero value for the company's franchise, which remains a Wall Street leader. (To be fair, investors simply could believe that the net value of the assets is going to come down if and when the economy turns.)Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs continues to invest in newer efforts. CEO David Solomon has noted that its Marcus online banking effort has received &quot;absolutely no credit&quot; from investors. The same is true of the new credit card venture with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). There are worries here with a market near all-time highs and an economy heading into year eleven of expansion. But Goldman Sachs stock seems to be pricing in much of the risk -- and little of the upside. JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: Shutterstock Shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) hardly look expensive, either. JPM trades at 10.3x 2020 consensus earnings per share estimates. Like GS, the low multiple comes in part due to worries about the economic cycle, but JPM still receives a nearly three-turn premium to its rival on an earnings basis.Of course, there's a strong case that JPM deserves that premium. I still think this is the premier big bank stock to own, along with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). And after the last 2-3 quarters, JPMorgan Chase probably has pulled ahead of BofA.There's simply a lot to like here. The combination of retail and investment banking is a plus. Growth continues to be solid: Q1 numbers crushed expectations as the company posted double-digit EPS growth. The company's delinquency rate, meanwhile, continues to decline and remains among the best in the industry.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal Again, near- to mid-term economic risks are a factor. Lower interest rates could pressure earnings in 2020. But I see this as a stock to buy and owned for decades, not just years, and the price at the moment remains attractive. Dow (DOW)Source: Roy Luck via Flickr (modified)This week, I called out Dow (NYSE:DOW) as one of the DJIA's 5 worst stocks so far this year, but as I wrote, that was a bit of stretch. DOW stock actually has risen 2.7% in its few weeks on the public markets, but in terms of the broader story, it's been a disappointment.That broader story was the breakup of the former DowDuPont into DOW, Corteva (NYSE:CTVA), and DuPont (NYSE:DD). Many savvy value investors saw the three-way split driving significant value, with many estimates topping $80 of value per DowDuPont share. The figure, at the moment, is under $50.There have been external pressures, to be sure. Adjusted earnings declined sharply in the first quarter. Trade battles between the U.S. and China aren't helping. Neither are concerns about the global automotive industry. Cyclical worries are a factor here, too: other chemical stocks like LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB) and Westlake Chemical (NYSE:WLK) are similarly cheap as investors discount potentially falling earnings.That said, there's a case to try and time the bottom here. DOW offers an attractive 5.5% dividend yield. It's still a leader in many of its end markets. Global demand may be choppy, but it should rise over time.This might be the most aggressive play in the index right now. DOW stock can take a beating if economic sentiment worsens. But personally, I'm not yet convinced that the smart money backing the DowDuPont split was necessarily wrong.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.Compare Brokers The post The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019

2019-06-20,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is getting into the cryptocoin business with a new currency dubbed Libra, which it says will be backed by a market basket of currencies, not just pegged to the dollar. Thus far, the announcement has proven positive for some FB stock investors, while others are far more cautious. With that said, here's a look at what we can expect from FB's Libra.Source: Shutterstock In a white paper the company said its plan is to build a blockchain that can let unbanked people around the world afford banking transactions. It announced a host of banking industry allies will support it, including Visa (NYSE:V), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Facebook is hoping for $1 billion of investment for Libra, but so far only $10 million has gone into it.Facebook stock had been shooting up since the start of June on rumors of the move, a gain of almost 16% since June 3, adding $75 billion to its market cap. Speculators sold the announcement, sending the Facebook stock price down 1% in overnight trading. FB was due to open at about $186.50 on June 19, a market cap of $538 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Why Libra?Credit card processors risk being bypassed in the developing world by blockchain and other technologies that let people trade and access banking services at low cost.  * 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for a Noisy Market India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), for instance, handled 250 million transactions last June after the government there removed high-denomination bills from circulation. Indian transactions of under 1,000 Rupee, worth about $14.30, can now be done using UPI for the equivalent of .14 cents. Standard Visa rates are about 3 cents per transaction, and a 2.5% &quot;discount&quot; to merchants for settlement risks.People with worthless currencies in places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela have turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The smallest unit of bitcoin, called a Satoshi, which is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, is now worth about 3 Zimbabwe cents. But the cost of the bitcoin blockchain makes it difficult for the ordinary citizen to use it.The Libra dream is of a stable coin running on a low-cost, global blockchain, allowing those who can't afford banking services to access them and, eventually, replace weaker currencies. The hope is that buyers and sellers will be able to move Libra money with simple Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp messages as early as 2021. Libra CriticsThe idea of a banking system that's only regulated as a blockchain and bypasses governments has its critics. Economist Nouriel Roubini says there's nothing blockchain about Libra, calling the whole thing a pipedream.Fans of existing crypto coins aren't thrilled by Libra either. Facebook insists its Calibra wallet, which will hold the Libra currency, won't share data with its ad platform. But analysts hyping the play still see power in combining financial data with Facebook's user data.Libra includes a new transaction language called Move, a protocol called Byzantine Fault Tolerance meant to make permission-less transactions safe, and a new Libra blockchain database. The Libra Association itself is defined as a non-profit, but the payment companies, internet merchants, venture capitalists, communication companies and blockchain enthusiasts involved all hope to make billions by using Libra to conduct business outside the current banking system. The Bottom Line for FB StockTrading on Libra today is trading on hype and hope.Facebook's value remains rooted in its free ad-supported services, which continue to churn out $15 billion of revenue each quarter, one-sixth of which becomes net income.  * 10 'Buy-and-Hold' Stocks to Own Forever Facebook's value is also based on its cloud network, with four data centers, three more on the way and more cloud capacity in Singapore.FB remains the smallest and, because of its business model, the most controversial and least stable of the Cloud Czars. (The others are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google.) Its goal in getting into financial services is to diversify its asset base and create a truly global footprint of data centers.It's all highly speculative. But it's also highly innovative. If that's what you're looking for in a cloud investment, look for an entry point in Facebook stock.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It's one thing for academics in Asia to rant against the tyranny of the dollar, or to make cheery forecasts about its impending eclipse by the Chinese yuan. But now that Facebook Inc. wants to spawn a new global currency – one that could meet the “daily financial needs of billions of people” and perhaps rival the greenback one day – central banks in Beijing, Jakarta, Manila or Mumbai won't exactly be ecstatic.To them, the prospect of being at the mercy of a cabal of tech czars and venture capitalists sitting in Switzerland could well mean swapping the yoke of the U.S. Federal Reserve for a less predictable and potentially more sinister dependence.What if Facebook's crypto, backed by fiat-currency assets and offering stable value, starts out by paying for coffee but over time becomes people's preferred store of wealth? What will it mean for monetary sovereignty? Suppose users of Libra, as the currency will be called, manage to set aside their outsize privacy concerns with Facebook. Were the tokens to take off and – against all regulatory odds at home and abroad – gain global acceptance, there will be several implications for governments around the world.Some of them will be of particular concern in Asia, where  most of the larger economies, starting with China, yearn for a growing role for their currencies in international commerce and as a store of value. Americans enjoy everything a little cheaper because the world – including money launderers, drug dealers and terrorists – wants the U.S. currency, which only the Fed can manufacture. China wants the same privilege for itself; and in a decade or two, India and Indonesia will, too. However, the long, patient game of internationalizing the yuan would get complicated if the Chinese on the mainland themselves take to Libra to bypass the country’s increasingly invasive social scoring system.Shielded by capital controls, Asian central banks at times seek weaker currencies to stimulate their export-led economies. But if people can move their wealth with one scan of a QR code to a digital coin backed by a reserve of low-risk assets – including bank deposits in various currencies and U.S. Treasuries – such stratagems won’t work any more. The People's Bank of China could then respond with its own digital currency, and unlike Facebook, pay interest on it.(2) Other central banks may join the battle for continued relevance. This competition, and not devaluation, could end up becoming the real currency war of the 21st century.None of us has experienced a central bank-sponsored digital currency yet: Our online payments are mediated by commercial banks or fintech. But it’s not a far-fetched idea. Seventy percent of the monetary authorities surveyed by the Bank for International Settlements last year said they’re working on the concept. So far they’ve had no reason to take the leap. Central banks already make digital cash available to financial institutions. Those are called bank reserves. Presumably, the Switzerland-based Libra Association, which will also include Visa Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz and other founders apart from Facebook, will also rely on a “geographically distributed network of custodians” to tap this closed user group for reserves.Nothing stops a central bank from providing its own digital tokens via commercial banks to compete with Facebook. If that doesn’t do the trick, the monetary authority can pull the ultimate stunt: It can open up its balance sheet to the public. Groups like the U.K.-based Positive Money, which is advocating for “Britcoin” to be held by individuals directly with the Bank of England, see it as the ultimate antidote to “extractive middlemen like banks and now tech companies.” Such a step would carry risks. In normal times, commercial banks can retain customer deposits by paying higher interest. But when panic strikes, deposits might flee to the central bank, even if the latter imposes a negative interest rate. Monetary authorities don’t want a funding shock to their banking systems. However, were Facebook to pose an existential threat, they may be compelled to walk an untrodden path.New purchasing power will increasingly come from Asia and Africa where the demographics are still favorable for high income growth. To the extent that global tech avoids paying national taxes when this purchasing power turns into digital consumption, it’s already a headache. Were Libra or another such project backed by the technology industry to take over where the dollar leaves off, concerns around a fair share of taxes could multiply. For that reason alone, Libra may not end up going anywhere in Asia.  (1) The Libra Association will use its income to pay operating expenses, and then to compensate early investors in the consortium.To contact the author of this story: Andy Mukherjee at amukherjee@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2019-06-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Line Corp., Japan’s largest messaging app, is close to getting a license to launch a cryptocurrency exchange in its home nation, according to people familiar with the matter.Japan’s Financial Services Agency could issue the license as early as this month, with exchange operations starting a few weeks after that, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. The service, which will be called BitMax, will allow Line’s 80 million users in Japan to buy and sell cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Line’s own token Link, one of the people said. Shares rose as much as 4.6%, the most intraday in two weeks.Line joins a crowded field of tech companies racing to roll out cryptocurrency products, including a move from Facebook Inc. earlier this week to create its own financial system with Visa Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. For Line, the pressure to succeed is particularly acute as stagnant user growth has pushed shares to their lowest since listing in 2016. The Japanese company booked a loss last fiscal year as it stepped up investments into new businesses to reduce its reliance on advertising revenue.Line spokeswoman Icho Saito declined to comment.BitMax will use the same back-end technology as BitBox, a Singapore-based crypto exchange that Line launched last year for global users, according to one person. BitBox is off limits to users in Japan because of the licensing issue and so far hasn’t delivered a big boost to the company’s earnings. Exchange volume over the past 24 hours was about $2 million, according to its website.Line is still awaiting a separate banking license in Japan that will allow deeper integration of cryptocurrencies with its other services like online shopping. That license is unlikely to be issued until next year, according to one person. Line aims to debut stock brokerage operations this year with Nomura Holdings Inc. and banking services next year with Mizuho Financial Group Inc., co-Chief Executive Officer Shin Jung-ho said this month.Facebook this week announced its new crypto project Libra, a so-called stablecoin that is expected to let users send and receive money, shop online and invest through the social media platform. In Japan, tech companies including Rakuten Inc. and Yahoo Japan Corp. have launched their own crypto exchanges this year after receiving licenses from the FSA.Crypto’s growing adoption by large companies is contributing to a rebound in prices this year, with Bitcoin more than doubling over the past three months.

2019-06-21,"It's been the prevailing wisdom that bank stocks can't rally, and so I've avoided betting on their upside. But there is an interesting sliver of the sector: fintech. These are the transactor companies and I personally favor Square (NASDAQ:SQ) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). The former, SQ stock, has been my go-to upside bet for months and it's been an easy trade.Source: Via SquareThis year, SQ stock has been out of favor on Wall Street. Suddenly, it lagged all the other major fintech competitors. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) are at or near all-time highs while Square stock has been languishing miles away from its own.  * 5 Boring Stocks to Buy This Summer Nevertheless, I remain positive on the company because the bull thesis has not changed. The world is still looking to migrate their transactions online, and SQ is part of the elite group of companies that will make that happen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecently Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced its indirect entry into the arena with their introduction of LIBRA. This further legitimizes all electronic financial transactors. So today's point is I should stay long Square stock regardless of the short-term dips for as long as the economic variables remains the same. Why To Go Long SQ StockThe macroeconomic conditions remain strong. This is in spite of the recent rhetoric that it's deteriorating. In the end, I suspect that it's not as bad as most fear.So, I am comfortable in my assumption that this environment is likely to persist for months if not years. And within it, SQ stock is still a buy right here. Luckily I have already written about buying the May dip. I sold bull put spreads and bought calls.The spreads yielded maximum gains already expiring today in my favor. My calls are already up 64% so I am letting them run. I may sell some covered calls against them to further leverage my asset. Because I sold the put spread means that I am understating my profit because my basis cost is null. It's basically a free trade from here.I am not sharing to brag but rather to offer perspective. Today's bullish SQ stock note stands alone. It still has more upside potential than downside risk this year. Currently, Square stock is in a tough zone which has been pivotal so it will offer resistance. Onus is on the bulls to plow through, and it may take a few tries.My first target for SQ is near $84 per share. But that would only bring it back to within 15% of the all-time high. This means I may be understating my target for the stock -- so the reward is pretty darn big even after the 25% bounce from $60 per share.This is not the same as saying SQ stock cheap because it's definitely not. Visa, MasterCard and PYPL are much cheaper from the traditional sense but SQ still needs time to grow into its valuation. So comparing them purely on value is wrong.Rallies rarely unfold in one straight line so there will be rough areas. I expect resistance around $76 per share. Clearly $84 will also be a challenge but if the bulls can break through it then they could finish the primary 2019 objective of $95 per share. Trading SQ StockNow that we've looked at what's above current price we also need to watch for potential pitfalls below.Depending on risk tolerance I would probably set my first stop at $71 per share. If that's lost then it could invite sellers down to $68 then $64 per share. While this is not my forecast, it is a realistic scenario that exist below especially if the geopolitical headlines cause a market wide panic sell in the next few weeks.If for any reason equities collapse I bet that SQ would find footing around $60 per share. This has been a big pivot level for 15 months. These tend to be sticky because both bulls and bears have battle histories at them.  * The 7 Best Dow Jones Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The bottom line is that Square stock had been in the penalty box for whatever reason but seems to have gotten out. It is now free to resume its prior trajectory because its products and service will be in high demand for years to come. I can even ignore the short-term dip because they are part of normal price action.

2019-06-23,"What a week! The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed over 2% last week, after the Fed cheered investors by indicating that it will cut interest rates next month. That sent tech and energy shares soaring- with the Dow climbing nearly 250 points on Thursday and reaching a record high in early trading on Friday. In short, the Dow is looking very strong right now- with the index up almost 15% year-to-date. In particular, the following five stocks are leading the pack in terms of year-to-date (YTD) performance. Here we turned to the Street to see whether these stocks still offer a compelling investing proposition. This is what top-performing analysts have to say: 1&#92;. Microsoft (MSFT)– up 35% YTDMicrosoft takes the award of best-performing Dow stock so far this year. The company has put on a remarkable sprint of over 30% year-to-date. And analysts are almost uniformly positive about the company’s outlook going forward. That’s despite the fact that the current average analyst price target of $143 only suggests upside potential of 4%. But if you take a longer-term outlook, the stock’s multiple opportunities quickly become apparent.One analyst singing MSFT’s praises is five-star KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin. He has just reiterated his Microsoft buy rating with a $143 price target. Bracelin made the call following a number of upbeat meetings with Microsoft Gaming executives. “Gaming represents a $100B+ TAM opportunity for Microsoft” commented Bracelin. “We see Microsoft Gaming as a small (9.4% of FY18 sales) but strategic growth segment where the transformation to a subscription-based model (i.e., the Netflix of gaming) could sustain healthy growth and improving margins over the next three to five years as it gains share within a $100B+ gaming industry” the analyst told investors on June 11. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley’s Keith Weiss calls Microsoft ‘the best positioned firm in tech for the emerging Hybrid Cloud architectures.’ He highlights the company’s unique position as both a top 'New Stack' share gainer and the 1 'Old Stack' share gainer.And let’s not forget the savvy deal Microsoft has just struck with Oracle. The two companies announced a “cloud interoperability partnership enabling customers to migrate and run mission-critical enterprise workloads across Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.” Moreover, “by enabling customers to run one part of a workload within Azure and another part of the same workload within the Oracle Cloud, the partnership delivers a highly optimized, best-of-both-clouds experience.” “Given Microsoft’s Azure is the 2 public cloud vendor in the world and Oracle is the clear 1 database vendor with a strong 2 position in enterprise applications that includes a fast-growing SaaS portfolio, we believe the two clouds complement each other well” writes Monness analyst Brian White, adding that the deal is a positive for both companies. View MSFT Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 2&#92;. Cisco (CSCO)– up 32% YTDClose on Microsoft’s heels comes networking giant Cisco Systems. Over the last three years, Cisco shares have doubled and the stock shows no sign of slowing down. Even in the last five days, shares have soared 4%. Even a ratings downgrade from William Blair analyst Jason Ader didn’t deter investors for long.The analyst cited &quot;signs of tightening demand across the IT infrastructure universe&quot; at the company. And this weaker demand environment &quot;could pressure growth in Cisco's fiscal 2020, especially when compared against unusually strong demand in fiscal 2019,&quot; the analyst said.As a result, Ader concludes that upside to consensus 2020 expectations, &quot;as well as multiple expansion, will be more challenging from here.&quot;Nonetheless, Cisco still boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus rating. The average analyst price target stands at $59 (4% upside potential). And with the ongoing trade war between US and China, Cisco continues to look relatively attractive to tech-focused investors. “Cisco remains our top pick for investors looking at safe havens in the current environment to navigate through the trade war noise,” commented JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee recently. He notes that “relatively modest exposure to China and largely immune to any trade-related impacts.” View CSCO Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 3&#92;. Visa (V)– up 31% YTDCredit card and payments giant Visa continues to outperform. And now top-rated Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri has raised his V price target from $170 to $187 (8% upside potential). According to Katri, Visa benefits from a double whammy of &quot;strong secular growth tailwinds,&quot; and accelerated, ongoing monetization efforts. He is confident Visa can deliver annual growth of 10% to 15% in credit-card revenue and 20% growth in adjusted EPS over the next few years.Encouragingly, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Joseph Foresi also sees a whole ‘basket of catalysts’ for Visa stock. Note that Foresi is ranked 2 out of over 5,200 analysts - so he clearly knows what he is talking about when it comes to stock picking. Not only does the company have a leading credit card position, it also offers significant opportunities for growth internationally and digitally. “We like Visa’s opportunity to capitalize on the global conversion of cash into credit, international opportunities, and digital payment tailwinds. Visa has a basket of catalysts expanding its TAM including Visa Direct, contactless payments, & B2B to name a few” writes the analyst. “We remain attracted to Visa's dominant position in the global card network market and its strong, recognizable international brand” the analyst told investors. View V Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 4&#92;. American Express (AXP)– up 31% YTDVisa isn’t the only credit card company delivering sizable gains. AXP is also up over 30% year-to-date. What sets AXP apart is that it is one of only a few financial service companies capable of both issuing and processing electronic payment cards. This means the company can generate revenue from interest earning products on top of network processing transaction fees.For Merrill Lynch’s Jason Kupferberg the company continues to look undervalued. He has just reinstated coverage of AXP with a buy rating with a Street-high price target of $145. From current levels this suggests shares can surge a further 17% in the coming months.He calls the company’s credit card membership program “a worthy investment which offers customers unique experiences beyond traditional rewards points.” And even though costs have been rising as a proportion of revenue, the analysts writes that he has nevertheless “been pleasantly surprised to see [American Express] strategically raise card fees to help offset these costs.”View AXP Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail 5&#92;. Disney (DIS)– up 28% YTD Walt Disney Co is enjoying a wild ride so far in 2019. The company is gearing up for the launch of its highly anticipated Disney+ streaming service in November. “Disney is our top pick in the content space as we reiterate our Buy rating and raise our price target to $175” cheers Rosenblatt analyst Mark Zgutowicz. Meanwhile Loop Capital’s Alan Gould sees Disney +’s first year subscriber count topping the 10M consensus.    Plus excitement is building over the opening of its highly anticipated $1 billion theme park expansion Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge. Starting June 24, the park will be open to the public without reservations. “The segment has been a key growth driver for the company over the last few years… Given the incremental returns from investment we are encouraged the company continues to invest in this segment with Star Wars Galaxy Edge” commented Zgutowicz. As if that wasn’t enough, Disney’s 2019 blockbuster Avengers: Endgame is now the second-highest grossing movie of all-time worldwide. And now Disney plans to rerelease the movie with additional scenes- a sneaky attempt to topple box-office leader Avatar from first place according to commentators.However, Imperial Capital’s David Miller has a word of warning for investors. He has just downgraded DIS from Buy to Hold, writing: &quot;The core rationale for lowering our rating to In-Line is simply due to the fact that the stock has performed consistent with our previous Outperform rating.”“Most of the catalysts we focused on at the time of that ratings change: the film slate, the opening of the two Star Wars lands, the disposal of the Regional Sports Networks, the Disney+ analyst day, and the re-financing of the various 21st Century Fox legacy debt tranches, have either happened, or are set to happen, and at a record multiple on 2021 earnings, are pretty much built in to the stock, in our view&quot; the analyst concludes.

2019-06-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apparently, Mark Zuckerberg has helped Bitcoin to surge past $10,000 again, a price it first surpassed in 2017 as part of an epic speculative bubble that popped not long after.Last week, the Facebook Inc. co-founder unveiled his social network’s cryptocurrency, Libra, a corporate version of Bitcoin that embraces regulation and is backed by fiat money like dollars or euros. (Bitcoin doesn’t and isn’t.)No matter the glaring differences between the two digital tokens, the symbolic coming-together of Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins – whose post-Facebook career has been all about dragging Bitcoin into the daylight of mainstream finance – has created a narrative where crypto has “made it.” If Zuckerberg is praising it, not burying it, this thing must be real.For those who have lived through three hype cycles in the space of five years, though, it is hard to put faith in the idea that the price of Bitcoin – which is up 100% since April, up 200% since February, yet still 50% down from December 2017 – reflects any intrinsic value better than one or two years ago. Much like the last time the currency hit $10,000, there is nothing stopping it from rocketing higher before crashing.What has changed since 2017? Much about the market is still murky, and regulators are probing potential price manipulation amid concern that a large proportion of reported trading volumes are fake or exaggerated. Tokens like Tether, which plays a big role in spurring Bitcoin trading, are firmly in investigators’ cross-hairs.For those who support Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment mechanism that cuts out banks, there's not much to cheer either. The virtual currency is still slow, cumbersome and costly. It processes about five transactions per second, versus about 1,700 on the Visa network. In times of high demand, the capacity problem becomes glaring; in April, transaction fees rose some 200 percent. Fixes like increasing the block size and off-chain transactions have only helped a bit.Nor is Bitcoin any more useful for retailers. The price volatility and high fees were already a turn-off for those dabbling in 2017. Two years later, companies that are testing crypto, like AT&T Inc., still prefer not to handle Bitcoin itself but to use a third party to convert it into dollars.Thus follows the “digital gold” argument – or, Bitcoin is so bad at payments it should only be HODL’d. Supposedly, every millennial needs crypto as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk: Central banks are keeping interest rates low, war in the Middle East is a rising possibility, and the EU is set to lose one of its biggest members.But that line of reasoning requires people to believe in Bitcoin as a store of value – a stretch for most – and for its price to reflect that. The currency’s three-year price chart offers little comfort.What’s left is exactly what’s always been there: A token whose price goes through the roof during times of exuberance because of artificially imposed scarcity. Bitcoin’s rules dictate there will only be 21 million of them, and the difficulty and rewards of mining new ones adjust along the way. Provided people always want some, and believe they are worth more than the Pokemon cards under the bed, the potential for price swings is unlimited. It’s a speculator’s paradise.Rather than blame Zuckerberg, we need to grapple with the real-world problems that fuel people’s desire for a golden ticket. For many millennials, saving money earns no interest, retirement looks to be a dream, and owning a house is beyond reach. That’s what allows people like Bitcoin icon Charlie Shrem to tweet: “5 BTC is all you need, HODL for 15-20 years and you’ll never need to work again.”Why blame Zuckerberg? Blame Satoshi, Bitcoin’s creator, or policymakers who haven’t worked out how to control speculative asset bubbles anywhere, let alone crypto’s. For once, Facebook isn’t the bad guy.To contact the author of this story: Lionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Brussels.

2019-06-23,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks might be happy to stay away from Facebook Inc.’s push into cryptocurrencies. For now.The Libra Association, the governing body for the coin, is in talks with lenders around the world to join its ranks. Banks are mostly keeping their distance after seeing tepid consumer reaction to digital wallets such as Apple Pay and regulatory scrutiny of digital currencies.“If Facebook is able to create mass adoption on this platform, then banks will want in,” David Donovan, who leads the global financial-services consulting practice at Publicis Sapient, said in a phone interview. “There’s a business decision they have to make. Facebook is saying the market is not being served well.”Banks were absent when Facebook announced Libra last week, saying that more than two dozen other companies, including payment networks Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., joined the project. The social-media giant said Libra will be backed by fiat currencies to provide payment services to the 1.7 billion people worldwide without easy access to banking.Facebook and its 2.4 billion active users are hard for the largest U.S. banks to ignore -- and Citigroup Inc.’s Michael Corbat has said his firm would consider joining Libra if asked. But it’s not the first time a technology giant promised sweeping changes to the payments world.Apple Inc. introduced Apple Pay in 2014 to much fanfare. Banks spent millions promoting the service and created card rewards tied to customer use of the product. In a sign of how eager they were, banks even gave Apple a cut of the coveted interchange fees they earn from each swipe of a card.But five years in, Apple Pay has struggled to take off. Large retailers including Walmart Inc. have been hesitant to accept the technology. And while consumers spent roughly $3 trillion using digital wallets in 2018, almost two-thirds of that spending occurred in China where apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay dominate commerce, according to a report from Juniper Research.“Advanced payment methods haven’t really taken hold unless they’re mandated,” Tim Spenny, a senior vice president at market researcher Magid who has consulted for Facebook and Visa, said in an interview. For him, the question is: “What is the use case or what is the pain point that would cause people to say ‘Hey, I’m going to put money into a cryptocurrency to start paying for things.’”After years spent trying to promote Apple Pay, U.S. banks turned their attention to tap-to-pay cards, which use the same technology while keeping the familiar card product. It’s a recipe that’s worked for JPMorgan Chase & Co. customers.“There’s a big segment that never used mobile wallets, but the moment they got their contactless cards, they’re starting to tap right away,” Abeer Bhatia, president of card marketing, pricing and innovation for the bank, said in an interview last month. “When they have the choice to use either, they’re overwhelmingly using tap-to-pay.”Banks have been conducting their own experiments with cryptocurrencies, such as JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, which is meant to speed up corporate payments. The largest U.S. lenders have also promoted a new real-time payments service spearheaded by The Clearing House.Regulatory ResponseThere have been cases where startups were assessed for compliance lapses. And Libra’s debut drew attention from regulators, as members of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee promised hearings on the digital coin and its governance.John Smith, who used to lead the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said tech companies and the banks they work with “will be held accountable” if they violate the law.“There’s a view within the fintechs that, ‘We couldn’t possibly do the rules that big banks do because we’re trying to be quick,’” Smith, co-head of Morrison & Foerster’s national security law practice, said Friday at a conference. “There’s going to be a rude awakening.”&#92;--With assistance from Lananh Nguyen, Michelle F.

2019-06-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin traded above $11,000 for the first time in 15 months, recouping more than half of the parabolic increase that captured the attention of mainstream investors before the cryptocurrency bubble burst last year.“The bounce-back of Bitcoin has been fairly extraordinary,” said George McDonaugh, chief executive and co-founder of London-based blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm KR1 Plc. “Money didn’t leave the asset behind, it just sat on the sidelines waiting to get back in.”Bitcoin surged as high as $11,251.21 on Monday, a 13% gain from late Friday that put it at the highest levels since March 2018. It was at $10,919 as of 11:01 a.m. in New York.The largest cryptocurrency had a furious run higher in late 2017 that culminated with a top above $19,500, before an almost-as-relentless move downward over much of 2018. It languished around the $3,300 to $4,100 range for several months.Bitcoin’s ride back accelerated in April, puzzling onlookers trying to pinpoint a reason for the surge. A study by Indexica, an alternative data provider, showed three main drivers: a more complex conversation surrounding Bitcoin, fewer concerns about fraud and a shift in the tense of how Bitcoin is talked about from the past to the future.“The market has matured greatly since the last time Bitcoin crossed $10,000,” said Matt Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro. “This run is far more justified given the current level of adoption.”Read more: Why Is Bitcoin Surging? Alternative Data Shows It’s Grown-UpIn contrast with last year, there are now signs of renewed mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology, most prominently Facebook Inc.’s Libra. The social-media giant is working with a broad group of partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. to develop the system, which has already attracted attention and criticism from politicians raising privacy and security concerns.Read more: Facebook Wants Its Cryptocurrency to Rival the GreenbackThe advent of Libra “is validating the crypto space and sending all the major digital coins higher,” said Edward Moya, chief market strategist at Oanda Corp. in New York. “Bitcoin volatility is likely to persist, with $12,000 and $15,000 as the next two critical resistance levels.”Technical gauges followed by some traders suggest the rally may not be over soon. Bitcoin’s directional movement index is currently in the longest positive divergence since the 2017 euphoric rise. The DMI shows the direction of a price trend by charting the divergence between positive and negative levels. The index is currently in a strong positive divergence as seen by the divergence between the +DMI and -DMI indicators and the average directional index is above the pivotal 25 mark, which signals a strong trend and is tailing upwards towards 50 which indicates a very strong trend.Still, the speed of the rally has some observers warning caution is once again warranted.To Whitney Tilson, founder of Empire Financial Research and a former hedge-fund manager, Bitcoin is “exhibit A” in the lexicon of “scams that enrich insiders at the expense of average folks.”“Don’t get fooled by the dead-cat bounce this year,” Tilson said in comments last week. “Mark my words: A year from now, it will be a lot lower. This is a techno-libertarian pump-and-dump scheme that will end in ruin.”(Adds technical analysis of the price trend.)&#92;--With assistance from Adam Haigh, Sarah Wells, Kurt Schussler and Kenneth Sexton (Global Data).To contact the reporters on this story: Eric Lam in Hong Kong at elam87@bloomberg.net;Vildana Hajric in New York at vhajric1@bloomberg.net;Joanna Ossinger in Singapore at jossinger@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Ravil Shirodkar, Dave LiedtkaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Bitcoin Surpasses $11,000 as Memories of Popped Bubble Fade"

2019-06-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Among Facebook Inc.’s justifications for introducing a new digital currency, Libra, the company has offered one pious rationale: to connect the 1.7 billion adults who lack bank accounts to the global financial system. That’s certainly one way for the “unbanked” to enjoy the convenience of digital money. Or they could just use a DeathAdder Elite.The DeathAdder is, of course, a high-performance gaming mouse made by Razer Inc. The Singapore-based gaming company recently entered a partnership with Visa Inc. that will allow players to go to a convenience store and buy prepaid credits to load onto their mobile phones, which they can then use to buy goods not just within Razer games but in the real world, at tens of millions of merchants who accept Visa.The credits effectively do what Facebook claims Libra will – provide electronic money to those without bank accounts or credit cards. And, though the Razer-Visa partnership is new, this prepaid model is relatively mature compared to Libra and other digital currencies. Facebook may well find that those it’s supposedly trying to help don’t need its help after all.The idea of allowing consumers to top-up their mobile phones with prepaid credits originated in Kenya more than a decade ago. During the mid-2000s, executives at Safaricom Plc., the country's largest telecom company, noticed that Kenyans were bypassing the traditional banking system, which was expensive and difficult to join, and traveling long distances to deliver cash to family members. So they developed M-Pesa, a system whereby Safaricom customers could buy mobile-money credits from agents who already sold Safaricom airtime. Those credits could be transferred via SMS text message and withdrawn as cash from another agent.When it launched in 2007, M-Pesa served 1.2 million customers. Today, 74% of Kenyans have mobile-money accounts; in 2018, they moved the equivalent of nearly half the country's GDP through their phones. And the trend has spread well beyond Kenya. In sub-Saharan Africa, roughly 60% of the population now uses such services; nearly 3 out of 4 Somalis over the age of 16 do so at least once a month. Similar services have sprung up in Asia and elsewhere. As of 2018, there were more than 866 million mobile-money accounts in 90 countries, and transactions totaled $1.3 billion daily.The uses for such products have multiplied as the number of customers has. Mobile money has contributed to the financing of microenterprises and small businesses. Interoperability between services facilitates remittances and trade across borders. M-Pesa, for example, has partnered with PayPal Inc. to allow seamless transfers between the two companies' respective wallets.Mobile money is also enabling e-commerce: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. recently opened up its AliExpress international platform to M-Pesa payments. In Southeast Asia, the region's two leading ridesharing companies - Go-Jek Indonesia PT and GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. - have been actively building themselves into mobile-payment systems. Already, users of both services can transfer credits to other users, or use them to shop or dine in physical establishments and, of course, pay for rides and food delivery.Mobile money can also be tailored to appeal to specific demographics within a region. For example, in Southeast Asia, the world's fastest-growing videogame market, a lack of credit cards and bank accounts limits the ability of companies to sell in-game products. Razer's solution was to acquire an online micropayment system so that users could buy credits from vendors such as convenience stores. Then the company created an e-wallet - Razer Pay – for players to spend or transfer credits, or cash them out. The deal with Visa, which will issue physical and virtual prepaid cards, allows Razer Pay to be used at 54 million merchants globally.Libra has advantages in the battle for the unbanked, starting with its perceived security in emerging markets where fraud has damaged the reputation of mobile money. More important, Facebook is already a crucial tool for small businesses and entrepreneurs in the developing world. A 2018 survey of consumers in Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria revealed that Facebook's groups were the second-most popular e-commerce site, preferred by 32% of respondents. By integrating Libra with Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, Facebook is positioning itself to become the first and easiest payment option for consumers in emerging markets.At the same time, for many consumers, Libra doesn't offer anything that mobile-money services don’t. More local alternatives also have the advantage of familiarity; many consumers will naturally prefer payment options that are already widely used by friends, family and local businesses, and that have well-established local agent networks. Meanwhile, governments already struggling to manage mobile-money services are likely going to favor those local champions rather than a transnational global behemoth. Facebook may find that doing good is harder than it looks.To contact the author of this story: Adam Minter at aminter@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Nisid Hajari at nhajari@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-06-26,"(Bloomberg) -- The Winklevoss twins have seen their wealth more than double since January, thanks to the frenzied rally of Bitcoin, which surged as much as 22% Wednesday.Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’s combined net worth -- consisting mainly of Bitcoin and crypto assets -- climbed to $1.45 billion, the highest since March of 2018, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Their combined fortune was $654 million at the beginning of the year.Bitcoin surpassed $13,000 Wednesday for the first time since January of last year after Facebook Inc. announced last week it planned to issue its own cryptocurrency in conjunction with partners including Uber Technologies Inc. and Visa Inc. Bitcoin has more than tripled since December, prompting many investors to ignore the 74% drop last year that followed the 1,400% surge in 2017.Read more: Facebook Wants Its Cryptocurrency to Rival the Greenback“The confidence is certainly returning,” Qiao Wang, director of product at crypto data startup Messari, said in an email. “The difference between now and the last time Bitcoin reached $13,000 is that the market is currently far more rational.&quot;The 37-year-old twins, known for their portrayal in the 2010 movie “The Social Network,” were among early investors in Bitcoin. In March, when it was trading below $4,000, they said that better oversight and compliance will help Bitcoin’s price recover.While the 2017 bull run was driven predominantly by hype and retail investment, there’s no obvious reason for the current rally, which is more “tame and rational,” said Larry Cermak, director of research at the Block.“There’s no evidence that it’s coming from one country,” Cermak said, referring to the theory that Iran is driving the surge. “If I were to make an educated guess, the rally was started by larger investors and sustained by some retail investors.”The price surge also may be a reaction to broader macroeconomic events, such as the devaluation of the yuan, which could be incentivizing Chinese buyers to acquire the currency to protect their wealth, Wang said. The Federal Reserve’s plan to pursue expansionary monetary policies may also be a factor, he said.“Bitcoin is digital gold and a hedge against inflationary economic crises,” Wang said. “If investors believe in this thesis, they should slowly accumulate Bitcoin and hold it for years to come. They should not go all-in or trade frequently.”Read more: Bitcoin Surge Pushes Weekly Gain to 40%, and It’s Only WednesdayTo contact the reporter on this story: Jasmine Teng in New York at jteng50@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill, Peter EichenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Winklevoss Twins' Fortune Doubles as Bitcoin Rallies

2019-07-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. may have boosted the single, greatest risk they face -- that of tougher regulation -- by becoming early backers for Facebook Inc.’s new digital money, called Libra.That’s according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette, who wrote that the three companies face a potentially “heavy burden” as already-fierce regulatory scrutiny is likely to keep growing.“It is not a stretch to imagine that widespread take-up and usage of Libra could result in the coin being able to become a free-floating currency,” Faucette said. That may turn it into a “supranational currency beyond the control of governments and central banks,” which means there’s probably going to an “up-swell of vocal opposition from regulators, central bankers, and lawmakers globally.”Mastercard and Visa face greater regulatory and political risk than technology risk, he said. As the cost of transactions fall, it will be hard to dislodge them as industry leaders -- unless there’s political or regulatory opposition. &quot;But such pushback is real,&quot; Faucette said.However, he’s still bullish on the companies, along with PayPal, as Libra isn’t yet “far enough along to dent our enthusiasm.” He also takes solace from some companies’ openness to leaving the Libra group “if opposition and process seem too daunting.”House and Senate hearings on Facebook’s digital coin, scheduled for mid-July, are “significant” for the company, and for Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and other firms, Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note.“These hearings are critical for Facebook,” he said. “There is only one chance to frame the debate. It has to set a tone at these two hearings for how Libra will benefit consumers while protecting their privacy.”That’s a hard task, as the hearings will likely be hostile and most lawmakers are likely to be skeptical. “Even lawmakers who generally support crypto are likely to see little political upside in supporting Facebook’s entry into the space,” Seiberg said.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will DaleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Visa, PayPal May Bear a ‘Heavy Burden’ With Facebook Crypto Plan"

It is worth noting President Donald Trump previously singled out the EU as a trade offender.The U.S. is already imposing tariffs on $21 billion worth of EU goods.

Dow Jones Loser: NikeBefore getting into some of today's Dow winners, let's take a look at Nike (NYSE:NKE), one of Dow's Tuesday losers with a loss of almost 1%. It is doubtful that Tuesday's loss represents the start of material declines for Nike stock, but today's action in the athletic apparel giant is endemic of the current political environment in the U.S.Nike was prepared to launch sneakers featuring the Betsy Ross version of the American flag. Former NFL football player Colin Kaepernick, a Nike endorser, complained that the flag was used during a period of slavery in the U.S. Nike decided to scrap the sneaker.It did not end there. Admonishing the perceived political correctness, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said he would yank the financial incentives his state offers Nike if the Betsy sneaker is pulled. Today's Dow Jones WinnersHats off to Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) for leading the way in the Dow today. On seemingly no company-specific news and below-average volume, the telecommunications giant jumped 2.59%. In the stocks favor today is this: Verizon did not rally simply because investors favored defensive stocks today. Many of the Dow's Tuesday winners were not boring or defensive stocks.Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) nudged up 0.59%, but some analysts are forecasting volatility for the iPhone maker between now and its next earnings date on July 30.Citigroup analyst Jim Suva &quot;estimated revenue of $52.6 billion, with iPhone revenues down 12% to $25.76 billion, and profits of $2.06 per share,&quot; reports Barron's. For Apple's June quarter, those figures are below consensus estimates.In a few months, Apple will likely unveil a new iPhone. Some analysts are not expecting major hardware improvements and it is expected the company will not have 5G-compatible phones out until 2020.Visa (NYSE:V) had a decent day, rising 0.77% after Wedbush analyst Moshe Katri said Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) recently unveiled Libra digital currency does not present a significant threat to Visa. Visa investors may get more word on that when the company reports earnings on July 23. Bottom LineWe've discussed several times in this space the aftermath of U.S.-China trade talks and their implications. That aftermath is here and while there will be ongoing talks between the two sides, for now, investors are asking, &quot;what's next?&quot;Recent global economic points have been sluggish, a scenario that if persistent, puts burden on various central banks -- including the Federal Reserve -- to act. That means investors should focus on monetary policy and earnings over the next several weeks. Those will be the clues for broader market direction this summer.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-02,"Square (NYSE:SQ), the financial services and mobile-payments company, is expected to report its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 7. Of course, the report could have a major impact on SQ stock.Source: Chris Harrison via Flickr (Modified)The global payments industry is a $100 trillion plus market. And the financial technology (fintech) apps revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against SQ stock, the fintech payments company that is regarded as a disruptive force in the sector. In the short-term, though, SQ stock is likely to be choppy.  * 7 Restaurant Stocks to Put on Your Plate  Square Stock's Ecosystem Is GrowingSquare was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). This innovative financial services company has expanded quickly,  with its unique dongles for mobile phones that enable virtually everyone to accept credit-card payments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSquare has come a long way since its more humble beginnings. Although SQ started as a payments company, in recent quarters it has introduced a range of software, hardware and apps for small businesses and individual clients. Square's ecosystem also includes business loans, payroll services, point-of-sale solutions, and omnichannel commerce.For example, SQ's peer-to-peer mobile payments product, Cash App, has more than 15 million monthly active customers. Square charges businesses that accept Cash App payments 2.75% per transaction.Management would like to see Cash App become more like a traditional bank whose core customers are small businesses as well as individuals. As the younger generations especially are making a drastic shift to using electronic payments, Square would like to benefit from that growth.Indeed, SQ has recently applied to become a traditional bank. Becoming a bank could jump-start Square's long-term growth, eventually driving SQ stock higher.In other words, through various growth initiatives, SQ is now aiming to become a major player in the fintech apps sphere as well as a small business platform that offers a wide range of services.When Square acquires a new client, it may be able to sell other services to the client.  Therefore, the future of SQ stock is partly dependent on the number of new clients it can attain and partly on the range of services it can offer.Released on May 1, its most recent earnings report and accompanying shareholder letter provide a good overview of the growth of its service offerings. Square's business model is evolving as the global payments space develops. The Fundamentals of SQ StockClearly, SQ is expanding its services and merchant ecosystem across different channels, and many growth investors are bullish about the long-term outlook of Square stock. However, they need to examine how each business that Square is now creating will contribute to its bottom line.While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has some questions about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.As a company that was founded in 2009, Square has not yet lived through an economic downturn. In other words, if the U.S. economy stalls, investors do not yet know how Square's management will respond. Additionally, since most of Square's customers are small businesses, which tend to be more vulnerable to economic hardships,Wall Street does not yet know how SQ stock may react if the economy sours.Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits for the company. And unless SQ increases its revenue, Wall Street may not be too forgiving of the high valuation of SQ stock. Therefore, I'd urge long-term investors to be cautious about Square stock at its current levels.In investing, it is not enough to personally like a potential product or service offering; instead, investors should also search for companies that have catalysts which can drive the value of their stocks higher.But many analysts are now expressing doubts over Square's expansion into lending and questioning whether SQ is taking on too much risk.Another area of potential concern is the declining growth of its transaction fees, which still generate the majority of its revenue. Square's shifts toward subscription and services revenues may not make up for the decelerating growth of its transaction fees.Square's most recent earnings report showed that the company's gross-payment volume grew a relatively modest 27% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.6 billion, causing Wall Street to become concerned about the outlook of Square stock. However, Square's gross revenues increased 43% YoY to $959.36 million.Yet SQ stock's quarterly net loss was $38 million, or 9 cents per share, compared with a loss of $24 million, or 6 cents per share a year ago.Moreover, management's subdued outlook disappointed the market, and investors penalized SQ stock in the wake of the news.Finally, the expansion of Square's ecosystem also means that SQ will face increased competition. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction-processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global- payments giant.Therefore, the owners of SQ stock need to decide whether the company has potentially diversified way too much away from its core business of payment processing. SQ Stock's Short-Term Technical Chart Paints a Mixed PictureLet us briefly remember how SQ stock price has acted over the years.Following the initial public offering (IPO) of Square stock in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, and lots of euphoria became baked into the stock price. As a result, Square stock has been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late December 2018, the stock was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 30%, April and May have not been good months for the shares. The company's weak Q2 guidance has triggered the recent volatility of Square stock.However, in June, Square stock participated in the stock market's rally and went up from an intraday low of $59.89 on June 3 to an intraday high of $74.55 on June 20.From a technical perspective, I am not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, possibly up until its earnings report in early August, SQ stock is likely to be rangebound between $65 and $75.SQ has strong support between $60 and $65. However, if there are any negative headlines that affect the technology sector in general or the fintech sector specifically, then Square stock may easily go below $60.I do not expect SQ stock to reach the $100 level in the coming weeks, as the market may be starting to value the earnings growth of the stock more realistically.The daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect SQ to be choppy at best in the near-term.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing the stock at this point. Strategies for Buying SQ StockSquare stock has fallen meaningfully in recent months. In the coming weeks, I would be a buyer of the shares of the payments company around $60 or lower, especially between $55 and $60.Investors who already own Square stock might want to stay the course and hold their position. That said, the owners of SQ stock who are worried about short-term profit-taking may, within the parameters of their portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, consider placing a stop loss about 3%-5% below the current price point, to protect the profits they've made so far.Experienced options investors may also consider using a covered call strategy with approximately a six-week time horizon. In that case, they may, for example, buy 100 shares of SQ stock around its current price of $72, and at the same time, sell, for example, a SQ Aug 16 $75 call option.The $75-strike option offers downside protection in case of volatility and a decline of SQ stock. The strategy would also allow investors to participate in a potential price increase of Square stock. This call option will stop trading on Aug. 16 and expire on Aug. 17.Such a covered call would provide breathing space until the markets potentially calm down. Then, after earnings season, investors can decide on the best course of action for their portfolios, with less anxiety than those who are unhedged. The owners of a growth stock like Square need to regularly assess their views based on updated earnings results and developments that affect the company and the economy. The Bottom Line on Square StockThe current economic and political environment in the U.S. and globally poses plenty of questions for market participants. And the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. If Square's revenue growth decelerates, then the price of SQ stock will also go down.I would consider buying SQ stock if  its price declines towards the $55-$60 level. I think the long-term  owners of SQ stock will be well-rewarded within three or four years as the company increases its ecosystem for small and mid-sized businesses and capitalizes on the potential of its Cash App.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Or was it? The ADP private payroll survey, which excludes local and federal government hiring, showed the addition of 102,000 private sector jobs last month, well below expectations of 135,000.The June jobs report is due out Friday, with economists expecting the addition of 165,000 jobs. In May, the U.S. economy added a disappointing 75,000 jobs. On the other hand, if jobs numbers and other marquee data points remain sluggish, the Fed could be compelled to act and lower interest rates, which would benefit riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that line of thinking in mind, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 added 0.75% and 0.77% respectively, today while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.67%. Lots Of WinnersIn late trading, 25 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were in the green, one of the highest numbers we've had the pleasure of revealing since we started this feature just over a month ago. None of the five losers had losses of 1% or more, and most were on the modest side. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was the Dow's worst-performing member today, losing 0.86%, but that was likely the result of some profit-taking, as the largest U.S. bank is up 5.6% over the past week.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Finishing the day higher by 2.3%, the consumer products behemoth Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was the Dow's best performer on a percentage basis. All of the Dow's consumer staples names closed to the upside today. As for P&G, the Ohio-based company reports earnings on July 30.Sticking with staples for a moment, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the largest domestic retailer, rose 0.7% despite reports that the company's e-commerce effort is losing $1 billion. Apparently, those are the costs associated with trying to take on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the online retail space.It was a light day in terms of analyst action on Dow stocks, but Visa (NYSE:V) added almost 1% after Wedbush reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the stock.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) gained almost 1% following reports that the stock is slated to enter a prestigious dividend index. Assuming IBM raises its dividend next year, that will mark 25 consecutive years of higher payouts, meaning the stock can enter the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a benchmark that requires members to have raised payouts for at least 25 straight years.Pharmaceuticals name Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) was one of the Dow's best names today, jumping 1.71% after Mizuho initiated coverage of the stock with a &quot;buy&quot; rating and $97 price target. The shares closed just under $87 Wednesday. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt is often said that the Fed is &quot;data dependent,&quot; a notion that could be tested as soon as Friday with the arrival of the June jobs report. Simply put, if that number is perceived to be concerning, stocks could still rally because traders will price in the Fed acting to help the economy, including with an interest rate cut.For those with bullish leanings, take heart: Barclays was out with a note indicating it is highly possible that the S&P 500 rallies another 10% from current levels.

That includes Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL).   * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 However, in this article, I'm got to look at the ramifications of FB's cryptocurrency, both good and bad, for Visa stockholders.  Why Visa Should Be Worried About LibraWhen I first read the news about Libra, my immediate thought was that companies like Visa would lose market share as individuals and corporations around the world switch to Libra to carry out transactions. But, as I read more about Libra and what it is and isn't, I realized that Visa shouldn't fear the cryptocurrency; instead, it should fear the regulators who are going to shine a big light on its systems as a result of FB's move to create a global currency for the unbanked. &quot;It is not a stretch to imagine that widespread take-up and usage of Libra could result in the coin being able to become a free-floating currency,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette stated recently. &quot;That may turn it into a 'supranational currency beyond the control of governments and central banks,' which means there's probably going to (be) an up-swell of vocal opposition from regulators, central bankers, and lawmakers globally,' he added. So, if Visa chooses to compete with Libra, what will happen if U.S. lawmakers get a sense that the company is standing in the way of lower transaction processing costs? Or, alternatively, if it cooperates  with the cryptocurrency, will governments take out some of their frustration with FB's cryptocurrency on Visa?  The members of the Libra Association, which includes FB, Visa, and 26 other companies, have each agreed, on a non-binding basis, to commit $10 million to the association. However, because so many details about Libra have yet to be worked out, including those surrounding security and privacy, it's unlikely that the funds will be forthcoming anytime soon.     The Libra Association says it will launch in 2020. Somehow, I doubt it will be able to meet its goal.  Why Visa Has No Reason for AlarmKeep your friends close and your enemies closer. Visa is one of the founding members of the Libra Association. It's got a seat at the table. If it doesn't like where the association is headed, it can always leave or vocally complain about what's happening. I have to believe that all the payments companies are going into this with their eyes wide open. The Verge's Elizabeth Lopatto recently wrote an interesting piece about Libra that everyone should read. It goes into detail about what Libra is and isn't. It's an excellent piece. She makes the point that a company like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) could develop its own cryptocurrency. Furthermore, Lopatto and University of Virginia Assistant Professor of Media Studies Lana Swartz  noted that FB isn't trusted by most consumers. &quot;People don't trust Facebook. They do trust Starbucks. Trust is a huge part of how money works,&quot; Swartz, told me. Starbucks has a greater geographical reach in terms of branches than any bank in the world, she says. &quot;Moreover, SBUX has a heavily used payment app and some of the most sophisticated fintech in the world,&quot; The Verge's Lopatto wrote in an article published on June 26. &quot;So maybe that's the answer: Starbucks launches StarBucks, its own branded cryptocurrency, and it just massacres Libra because we like and trust Starbucks, and we don't like or trust Facebook,&quot; she stated.She's absolutely right. Starbucks is in a much better position with consumers than FB ever will be. I, for one, would like to see SBUX do something to help the unbanked. Whatever happens, I'm sure Visa's got a plan to cope with competition from SBUX and/or FB.  The Bottom Line  Whether you own Visa, Mastercard, or Paypal, I think you've got an excellent investment and should continue to hold onto the shares for the long haul.

2019-07-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Even before Gram is released to the public, Telegram Messenger’s cryptocurrency may have appreciated by 200% from last year, when it began one of history’s biggest ever initial coin offerings. Just ask one of the early investors.South Korea’s Gram Asia offered to sell rights to the Grams it holds at $4 apiece in a sale beginning July 10, according to Japanese crypto-exchange Liquid. This compares with $1.33 paid by private investors in the second ICO round in March 2018. The price will be lowered to $3.50 per Gram if buyers hold a specific amount of Liquid’s cryptocurrency QASH, the exchange said in emailed statement Wednesday.The fund-raising is a landmark in the crypto world not only because of its size. Telegram’s encrypted-messaging app boasts over 200 million users. The enterprise, founded by self-exiled Russian Pavel Durov, raised $1.7 billion from qualified investors last year to fund developing the Telegram Open Network blockchain, which will use the cryptocurrency Gram.Telegram has targeted a start date by the end of the third quarter 2019, before Facebook Inc.’s Libra token debuts. A company representative declined to comment.Durov aims to enable transaction speeds faster than the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains and may seek to compete with Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., according to company documents. Grams are planned to be used to pay for different services on TON blockchain, including user applications, decentralized data storage and bypassing censorship.The sale on Liquid comes at a whippy time in the markets. The 30-day volatility for the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index is 109%, the highest level since January.

2019-07-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc., facing fury from skeptical lawmakers, sought to mitigate concerns that have been raised about its proposed cryptocurrency, stating that the token’s purpose is to create a secure and low-cost way for consumers to move money around the world.“We understand that big ideas take time, that policy makers and others are raising questions, and that we can’t do this alone,” Facebook’s David Marcus wrote in the letter dated July 8. “We want, and need, governments, central banks, regulators, non-profits, and other stakeholders at the table and value all of the feedback we have received.”Marcus’s letter follows repeated demands from House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, that Facebook halt the token’s development until policy makers have a better sense of how it might be regulated.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the banking panel’s top Democrat, has asked a question on many lawmakers’ minds: if Facebook can’t safeguard its users’ personal information, how can it be trusted to secure their financial data?A big test for Facebook in trying to persuade lawmakers that there’s nothing nefarious about its coin, called Libra, comes next week. The Senate Banking Committee is holding a hearing on the token July 16, followed by a House Financial Services Committee hearing the next day. Marcus, the executive leading Facebook’s Libra and blockchain efforts, is scheduled to testify before both committees.The hearings come at a pivotal time for Facebook, which already faces distrust in Washington over its power, major data breaches and a Russian hijack of its platform during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. In the letter released by the Senate panel Tuesday, Marcus said Facebook has reached out to regulators across the globe, and will ensure that consumers are protected and that the role of central banks and governments with Libra is “appropriate.” He also said that Facebook’s Libra subsidiary, Calibra, has applied for state money transmitter licenses and is registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which tries to detect money laundering and other financial crimes.Facebook, which is ostensibly just one member of a larger Libra Association, has taken the lead on reaching out to regulators and stakeholders to lobby for the digital currency. But Marcus said in the letter that the Libra Association, which includes payments giants like Mastercard and Visa, will continue Facebook’s outreach role as the association grows.(Updates with lawmakers’ comments starting in the third paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Austin Weinstein in New York at aweinstein18@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory MottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Defends Libra Token Ahead of Congressional Scrutiny

Consider that the offering came a week after JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) acquired Bear Stearns for a measly $2 per share (the deal also required a mega loan from the Federal Reserve).Source:  Kārlis Dambrāns via FlickrDespite all that, investors still bought  $17.9 billion of V stock. On its first day of trading, V stock price rose by an impressive 28%.Anyone who bought Visa stock during its IPO and held onto it would have benefited from hefty gains. For the past ten years, the average annual return of V stock was 28.28%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 While all this is great, what can we expect in the years ahead? Is V stock still a good buy? To find out, let's take a look at three pros and cons of Visa stock: Visa Stock Pro: Dominant PlatformVisa operates the world's largest payment network, with 3.3 million cards in use across the globe. The company processes an enormous 188.1 billion transactions per year.The result is that Visa has been able to benefit from powerful network effects. That means that the more consumers become part of the system, the more attractive it is for merchants to participate in it. As a result, it is extremely difficult for other companies to effectively compete with Visa. Besides Visa, only Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) have credit-card networks in the U.S. Visa Stock Pro: InnovationVisa continues to invest heavily in R&D. For example, the company has built Visa Direct, which enables payments to be sent to credit cards.Then there is the company's tokens. which are used for digital payments. This technology has been shown to greatly reduce fraud, but is also quite convenient.M&A and venture-capital investments have been critical for bolstering Visa's innovation. Note that Visa has taken equity positions in companies like Square (NYSE:SQ), Klarna, Payworks, Stripe and SolarisBank. Visa Stock Pro: Strong FinancialsAs shown by the company's, second-quarter results, released in April,  Visa's growth remains fairly steady. Its revenues increased  8% to $5.5 billion, as there was strength across all its main businessesVisa's margins remain juicy, at over 54%. In Q2, its net income came in at $3 billion, up 14% year-over-year.And its balance sheet is solid. It has about $15 billion of cash. Visa Stock Con: Regulatory RiskA key part of Visa's business model is interchange fees. But for many merchants, those fees have become a costly burden. So they have lobbied in multiple countries, including the U.S., to  convince regulators to reduce the fees. If they succeed, Visa's bottom line would definitely be adversely impacted. According to the company's 10-K:&quot;When we cannot set default interchange reimbursement rates at optimal levels, issuers and acquirers may find our payments system less attractive. This may increase the attractiveness of other payments systems, such as our competitors' closed-loop payments systems with direct connections to both merchants and consumers. We believe some issuers may react to such regulations by charging new or higher fees, or reducing certain benefits to consumers, which make our products less appealing to consumers. Some acquirers may elect to charge higher merchant discount rates regardless of the Visa interchange reimbursement rate, causing merchants not to accept our products or to steer customers to alternate payments systems or forms of payment.&quot; Visa Stock Con: CompetitionVisa faces intense competition from alternate payment providers, such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Alipay and China's WeChat. All of those competitors have the benefit of massive digital platforms.Then there is Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is creating a cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology. Called Libra, FB's cryptocurrency is expected to hit the market next year, with a focus on  consumers who don't use banks. If it catches on,Visa stock price could be negatively impacted, since FB has the benefit of its 2+ billion user base. Visa Stock Con: ValuationGiven Visa's competitive advantages, Visa stock does deserve to trade at a premium. But then again, the valuation of V stock has become steep. Note that the forward price-earnings ratio of V stock is about 28  and that Visa stock does not pay a dividend. To put that into perspective, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) has a PE ratio of 21 and FB is at roughly the same level. Those companies are also growing much more quickly than Visa.As for Wall Street analysts, they remain bullish on V stock, but their enthusiasm is tempered. Based on analysts' average target price on V, Visa stock price is expected to climb about 13%. The Verdict on VisaVisa certainly has some major risk factors. Perhaps the most important one is its competition. As we've seen in various industries, startups can unleash disruption quickly.But so far, Visa has done a good job of innovating. Moreover, the overall credit-card market is likely to  grow in a non-cyclical manner. Keep in mind that, worldwide, consumers still use  cash and checks to pay for about $17 trillion of goods and services. Consequently, there's still a great deal of room for credit-card usage to increase. There are also big opportunities for Visa in business-to-business transactions and peer-to-peer payments.Given all of Visa's positive attributes - including its strong financials, robust platform and powerful technologies - the pros of V stock outweigh its cons.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-15,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s long seemed that nothing could unite President Donald Trump and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Then Facebook Inc. decided to create a cryptocurrency.Washington’s bipartisan distrust of the social-networking giant will be on display this week as it defends the digital-money proposal in two congressional hearings. In a sign that the testimony is likely to be an ordeal for Facebook, Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to bash the effort.The presidential lashing was just the latest setback for Facebook, which rolled out its plan for a token called Libra in June –- a move that many policy makers called hubristic and ill-timed, considering the political turmoil that continues to swirl around the company. Last week, Facebook agreed to pay about $5 billion in a record privacy settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.Facebook’s traditional pre-hearing courtesy visits to discuss Libra in the House and Senate aren’t going well, according to interviews with lawmakers and congressional staff. While the company has taken pains to describe its initiative in utopian and futuristic terms, lawmakers have been more interested in data security, the company’s awesome market power and why it decided to base the operation outside the U.S.Facebook’s Libra Crypto Coin: 5 Things We Know, and 5 We Don’t“Look at their arrogance, look at their role in the 2016 presidential campaign, look at the fact that they’ve rarely shown any contrition on much of anything,’’ Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the Banking Committee’s top Democrat, said in an interview. “There’s going to be a group of us that’s going to demand some real information.’’Complaints about Libra haven’t just come from politicians. Trump-appointed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers last week he has “serious concerns’’ about the token and cast doubt on Facebook’s timeline for launching it by next year. He also warned that the U.S. regulatory system may not be equipped to handle the enormous digital payment system envisioned by Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users.Democrats, including Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California, have already demanded that the company put its plans on hold while Congress investigates. Republicans, though less vocal, also haven’t been supportive.Power to DominateThe controversy around the project, however unwanted by Facebook, nevertheless highlights the company’s power to dominate policy debates and, to some extent, set the agenda in Washington. Until Facebook jumped in a few weeks ago, cryptocurrency was more of a fringe issue that attracted an unusual crowd of libertarians, speculators and blockchain geeks. Many in Congress were uninterested.The stakes are high for both Facebook and the broader digital coin industry as David Marcus, a top executive at the company, prepares to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.In his prepared remarks, released by the Senate panel Monday, Marcus acknowledged the extensive criticism and pledged to work closely with regulators and governments across the globe. He also addressed one of Washington’s top concerns, saying Libra isn’t intended to compete with national currencies or interfere with central banks on monetary policy. “We know we need to take the time to get this right,” Marcus said in the testimony. “And I want to be clear: Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.”Existing LawsMarcus, whose preparation has included a mock hearing, also told the senators that while Facebook has spearheaded the Libra project, it’s not acting alone. The company has said that it envisions a governing body that would include at least 100 organizations. There are currently 28 listed as founders for the Libra Association, although none has paid the $10 million entrance fee.Libra, he added, will help consumers across the world transfer money much more efficiently and cheaply. And, Marcus warned that if “we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.” Though he didn’t offer specifics, the People’s Bank of China has already said it’s developing a digital currency.Facebook has been making similar arguments in briefings with lawmakers and congressional aides, according to interviews. The major companies that have partnered with Facebook on the project, including Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., have been mostly silent about Libra and largely absent from the lobbying effort.Few details on Libra have been disclosed beyond a 12-page white paper issued in June, which said Libra will be built on a new blockchain infrastructure accessible from anywhere in the world. Facebook and its partners have set up a non-profit organization in Switzerland to oversee the payment network. The token will be backed by a reserve of bank deposits and short-term government securities.Trump, in his tweets last week, said he’s “not a fan” of digital coins in general because of their potential use in criminal activity. As for Libra, Trump wrote that it “will have little standing or dependability.” He added that if Facebook really wanted to get into finance it should become a bank -- and be regulated like one.Though the price of Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies has gained on the surge in mainstream interest in the concept, a number of competing digital coin companies are distancing themselves from Facebook. Some industry groups are also conducting briefings for congressional staff, pointing out that Facebook’s plan is light on details and not necessarily representative of all tokens.Libra is more of a “company-issued asset” rather than than a true cyptocurrency like Bitcoin, said Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito, who’s been involved in some of the meetings on Capitol Hill. A key complaint among purists has been that Libra isn’t decentralized. “There is no company that issues Bitcoin,” Brito added.$5 Billion SettlementBlockchain Association Director Kristin Smith, whose group represents several large crypto companies, said she’s generally not opposed to Facebook’s entrance into the market. She acknowledged, however, that there’s a lot of potential risk.“It’s mixed,” she said. “We certainly don’t want the whole industry to become associated with some of the issues that Facebook has had as a company in the past.’’Along with complaints that it allowed Russia to hijack its platform to support Trump’s election campaign, the company has also drawn fire for numerous consumer privacy breaches. The $5 billion FTC settlement, which still needs final approval from the U.S. Department of Justice, resolves an investigation stemming from Facebook’s involvement with Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica.Need to ClarifySmith attended a news conference at the Capitol last week with four moderate Democratic and Republican members of the House who are strongly supportive of the financial technology industry. They, too, weren’t leaping to endorse the Libra project.Representative Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the financial services panel, said at the event that he hopes the focus on Facebook’s proposal will prompt lawmakers to consider legislation that clarifies the regulatory landscape. Some of the laws governing digital currency, he noted, go back to the 1930s.“We have to have the conversation,’’ he said. “I don’t want to lose the jobs and innovation elsewhere.’’Gottheimer plans to strike a similar theme at the Facebook hearing this week, but it’s not clear how many other members of the House panel will be interested in the finer details of Libra or digital payments.Some lawmakers predicted that the hearing may quickly devolve into a series of anti-Facebook rants, on issues like fake news in the 2016 campaign, data protection, the company’s market dominance and the FTC settlement. Those topics are often easier to understand for some members of Congress who are decidedly not techies.In what may be a harbinger, Financial Services Committee member David Scott, a Georgia Democrat, mistakenly referred to the digital token Libra as Libor, an interbank lending rate, while questioning the Powell last week. The Fed chief didn’t bother to correct him.(Updates with Marcus testimony beginning in 10th paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Lydia Beyoud, Austin Weinstein and Julie Verhage.To contact the reporters on this story: Robert Schmidt in Washington at rschmidt5@bloomberg.net;Ben Bain in Washington at bbain2@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Gregory MottFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook's Crypto Plan Unites Trump and Democrats in Disdain
2019-07-16,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average may be a fundamentally flawed index in terms of how it's weighted -- choosing to use price rather than the market cap -- but in terms of what companies are in the index, the Dow Jones can't be beat. Dow Jones stocks represent the &quot;Bedrock of America&quot; and some of the most important companies on the planet. There's a reason why financial media still quotes the close and movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.However, some of the thirty Dow Jones stocks are better than others. This is especially true when looking at what names will still be in the index down the road and continuing to lead in the world of business.Some Dow stocks feature very forward-looking businesses models and operations. It's these firms that will still be alive and kicking far into the future. And it's here that investors can score on some future potential and the gains and dividends that come with it. In the end, while the Dow is still important, but some stocks within the index are just better than others.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills With all of that said, you might be wondering: Which Dow Jones stocks have the best long-term potential? Here are three of the best stocks to buy from the index. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to long-term bets with the Dow Jones stocks, Visa (NYSE:V) has to be at the top of the list. The firm is one of the biggest plays on the continued shift toward a cashless society. And as one of the oldest and largest names in the space, V continues to dominate as we reach for plastic rather than cash.The reason is Visa's business model. The firm functions as a toll-road and collects fees from merchants, banks and other institutions every time someone uses a credit or debit card. V simply operates a secured payment network and moves money from one account to another. So, despite having a Visa logo on your credit card, V itself isn't issuing credit or lending you money.This middleman position is incredibly important for the future. More transactions continue to hit Visa's network. Over the first three months of the year, Visa processed more than 47 billion transactions. This was a 9% year-over-year jump and it's only growing further. With online commerce and fewer people using cash, Visa will be the dominant force going forward. The firm also continues to make inroads into additional services to keep upstarts like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) at bay.The best part of all of this is that V features very fat margins and amazing cash flow growth. More transactions on its network simply mean bigger profits for the firm. And it continues to share those profits with its investors -- growing its dividend by 850% over the last decade.The future cashless society will run on Visa. That fact makes one of the best Dow stocks to buy for the long haul. Disney (DIS)Source: Shutterstock Let's be honest, as long people have children, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is going to be making money hand over fist. And lately, DIS has plenty of reasons to underscore that fact.For one thing, its buyout of 21st Century Fox created a media powerhouse. This brought many major movie and T.V. franchises under one roof. And if anybody can monetize that content through a variety of channels, it's Disney. And one of those ways will be its new streaming services.Disney has already begun pulling its shows and movies from rival streaming services in order to make them exclusives to its new Disney+ service. That's big because the vast of streaming is kids programming. With the complete Disney, Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar movie libraries as plenty of its original programming content from the Disney Channel, Disney+ will be the go-to channel for parents looking for entertainment.When you combine with the firm's new moves in its park and recreation divisions -- such as Star War's Galaxy Edge -- as well as continued movie development from its studios, there's a lot to like about DIS stock for the long haul. And we've already begun to see those results. Just take a look at Disney's record second-quarter earnings. Those great results don't even take into account streaming yet.  * 7 ETFs With Oodles of Diversification For investors, DIS stock is a perfect blend of growth for the long haul. Cisco (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock These days, that famous scene in The Graduate wouldn't be about plastics, but about the cloud. Cloud computing, networking, the app economy continues to reshape how businesses and consumers do, well, everything. Which is why Dow Jones stock, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) continues to be an amazing long-term pick.CSCO's bread-n-butter remains networking and communications equipment. It still builds all the switches routers, modems and other guts needed to make modern data centers and the internet/cloud computing function. This isn't a bad business to be in as data center demand continues to grow. Analysts at Jones Lang LaSalle estimate that data center demand will double by 2021 as cloud adoption grows. That will send plenty of money Cisco's way.But the ace up Cisco's sleeve has to be its newfound focus on services and software.The firm now offers plenty of tangential products designed to go along with networking. They can not only build you a network but secure it, offer data analytics and other similar products to look after this equipment. These services often come with long subscription times and very fat margins. It's here, that CSCO has quickly become a cash cow and one of the best dividend stocks in the technology sector.Its approach on both equipment and services sales, coupled with rising overall data center demand, CSCO has the goods to keep growing far into the future.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-16,"Shares of global payments giant Visa (NYSE:V) have been on fire in 2019, rising 35% through the first six months of 2019 to fresh all-time highs. The catalyst? Broadly favorable macroeconomic and market conditions, which have simultaneously supported continued healthy consumer spending trends and a richer valuation for Visa.Source: Shutterstock In the long run, Visa stock is a winner. The global payments world continues to pivot away from cash payments to card payments. This trend will persist for the foreseeable future. In developed economies, cash usage is still relatively high, giving ample room for further card payment volume growth. Meanwhile, in developing economies, the rapid urbanization and expansion of consumer middle classes will support bigger card payment volume growth.Visa is the biggest card payment player in the world. Given the card payments space continues to grow at a healthy pace over the next several years, so will Visa's revenues, profits, and Visa stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut, that does not mean Visa stock is the best buy here and now.Visa stock has come a long way, very fast in 2019, and the present valuation on the stock looks slightly overextended. To be sure, low interest rates today support this slightly extended valuation. But, if and when rates do creep higher, that will pressure Visa's valuation.The investment implication? While Visa stock is a long-term winner, this victory is not worthy of paying $180 per share of V stock. Investors should rather wait for this red-hot winner to cool off, and consider buying the stock on the next dip. Visa Stock Is a Long-Term WinnerZooming out, the big picture trends supporting Visa stock are exceptionally favorable, and possess a high degree of visibility. This combination of high visibility and big growth ultimately pave a very tangible pathway for Visa stock to climb higher in the long run.Globally, consumers are pivoting away from cash transactions to non-cash transactions, because non-cash transactions are more convenient and more levered to digital shopping. Global non-cash transaction volume has risen at a steady 10%-plus clip over the past several years.This trend will persist. Cash usage is still relatively high in developed economies, despite the fact that cash is a less convenient and relevant payment method than card. Card penetration rates in developing economies are still low, and will continue to rise at a rapid pace as those developing economies urbanize and digitize. That's why global non-cash payments volume is expected to grow at a steady 10%-plus pace for the next several years, while emerging market non-cash payments volume is expected to grow at a 20%-plus pace.Visa is at the heart of this gloval global cards payment pivot. Excluding China, Visa controls 50% of the global card payments market. The company has consistently rattled off high single digit or better volume, transaction, and revenue growth over the past several quarters. As the global card payments market continues to expand, Visa's volume, transaction and revenue growth rates will continue to run, at least, at a high single digit. At the same time, margins will gradually expand with scale, and profit growth will be robust.By that time, Visa projects big profit growth. That growth will ultimately drive Visa stock higher in a multi-year window. The Valuation Today Is RichAlthough Visa stock is a long-term winner, the price tag on Visa stock today seems a bit rich, and may not produce the best multi-year returns.Visa reasonably projects as a high single digit revenue grower over the next several years. Margins also reasonably project to keep marching higher at ~100 basis points or less per year. Including buybacks, Visa's EPS growth should run around 10%-15% over the next several years. At that growth rate, Visa's EPS will settle around $11 by 2025. Based on a historically average 25 forward multiple and 10% discount rate, that equates to a fundamentally supported 2019 price target for Visa stock of roughly $170.Thus, at $180 mid-way through 2019, Visa stock seems slightly overvalued.To be sure, this slight overvaluation is supported by a low interest rate environment. As long as rates remain low, this slight overvaluation in Visa stock will hang around. But, if rates creep higher, that will pressure Visa's valuation, and ultimately drag on V­isa stock. Bottom Line on V StockOverall, Visa stock is a winner. But, in the near term, low rates seem to have inflated the valuation on Visa stock to artificially high levels. It is a &quot;tread with caution&quot; situation. I would not be a buyer until the presently stretched valuation comes down to more reasonable levels.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-16,"There are few companies that can match the profitability of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Source: Shutterstock In 2018, Facebook reported profits of over $22 billion, 40% of its $55 billion in revenue. Investors are paying more than 10 times revenue for that, based on the stock's price of about $204 per share and a market cap of $583 billion.But I covered such a company this week: Visa (NYSE:V). After bringing $10.2 billion to the net income line last year, Visa was worth over 20 times revenue as trading opened July 16 at $181 per share and a $406 billion market cap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsElectronic money is so powerful that Visa is now worth more than JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank, which has a market cap of $373 billion.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Visa is what Facebook wants to be when it grows up. Libra is how it gets there. Ensuring ComplianceAfter a month spent talking about Libra as cryptocurrency, Facebook plans to tell Congress this week that Libra is more like Visa.Libra has registered as a Money Services Business and says its blockchain will comply with U.S. regulations regarding money laundering and financing of terrorism.In a blog post, Libra co-creator David Marcus asserts the Libra blockchain's &quot;know your customer&quot; practices will be &quot;a big opportunity to increase the efficacy of financial crimes monitoring and enforcement.&quot;This turns the paradigm of cryptocurrencies on its head. It makes transactions less anonymous and more difficult to hide than in the present system.The difference is that, while banks today have to police compliance at the teller's window, so to speak, Libra will make its blockchain available to police. Facebook will control neither the network, the currency, nor the reserve backing it. Its Calibra subsidiary will just be running digital wallets. Is That Enough?Whether that's enough for Democrats is an open question. The House Financial Services Committee is drafting legislation called the &quot;Keep Big Tech Out of Finance&quot; act, specifically aimed at keeping Facebook out of the money business.Even the rest of the tech industry doubts Libra will get off the ground next year as planned. The wallet has already been banned in India, where banks are forbidden from handling cryptocurrencies.Marcus has disposed of objections about money laundering, but economists now claim Facebook threatens to replace the dollar and other currencies.  That's because the Libra Association, based in Switzerland, would hold reserves of various currencies to back Libra, acting as a digital central bank. If it's less expensive to run than a real central bank - and that's the whole point - it could replace national banks, according to economist Peter Morici. The Bottom LineThe blockchain paradigm, in which transactions are part of a central database, avoiding the costs of real money, has inherent cost advantages over the systems used by central banks and transaction processors like Visa.Libra's structure, transactions backed by a currency reserve, is similar to that of Alibaba's (NASDAQ:BABA) Alipay. Its costs are like those of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI).What those two systems have are huge, unified markets to grow in. China controls Alipay, India controls UPI. Low-cost systems for electronic transaction processing exist, and unless the West gets in the game it could be buried by them.That's the card Facebook, and other &quot;fiat&quot; coins like JPMorgan Chase's JPM Coin, are going to be playing in order to go into electronic money. Let us in, they'll say, or China and India get the business.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-16,Visa (V) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations.,Visa (V) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release
2019-07-16,"Few industries drip money as copiously as the credit card industry. Card issuers make money on both ends of every transaction – from fees and interest charges to the customer, as well as to the merchant. It’s a business model that has propelled both Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) to the top of the financial world, as leaders in the electronic transaction and payment processing segment.The two companies have other factors in common. Both report earnings this month, Visa on July 23 and Mastercard one week later, and both are expected to show notable gains. Last month, both companies were announced as founding members of Facebook’s (FB) Libra Association, indicating their joint interest in staying on top of developments in online transaction, and an indication of their corporate view toward P2P services and cryptocurrency.There is another commonality: both stocks have attracted attention from the same top analysts in the TipRanks database. Five-star analysts Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank and Moshe Katri of Wedbush published notes on both companies, and raised their price targets based on their common upbeat outlook for the stocks. Let’s see what they had to say. Mastercard, Inc. (MA)Start with Mastercard. While the logo is ubiquitous on charge cards worldwide, Mastercard does not actually issue them itself. In this, it shares another similarity with Visa. Both companies permit their branding on cards issued by banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions, and then process the payments and transactions between card holders at point of purchase and the merchant.Katri was first to weigh in on Mastercard, writing on June 13, “expect results to benefit from strong secular growth tailwinds, as well as from accelerated, ongoing monetization efforts. MasterCard generates roughly 15% of revenues from non-transaction processing, services, and expect the mix to expand further as some of the new growth areas gain scale/traction.” In short, Katri expects that emerging non-card, online payment systems will form an increasing portion Mastercard’s business as the company adapts to the changing conditions of the app-based online world. In line with his expectation of the company’s success, Katri raised his price target on MA by 10% to $287, indicative of a modest 2.73% upside to the stock.Bryan Keane published his note on the charge card companies earlier this month, taking especial note of both companies’ participation in Libra. Of Mastercard, he believes that, while new transaction models will continue build, the company has “a long runway to benefit from the secular growth of card-based transactions.” Like Katri, he raised his target on MA, setting it at $330. His target indicates greater confidence in Mastercard, with an 18% upside.MA Earnings HistoryMastercard will report Q2 earnings on July 30. The company is expected to show an EPS of $1.82, a strong gain of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.66. MA has beaten the earnings forecast for the last 10 quarters.Overall, Mastercard has a strong buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 20 buys and 1 hold given in the past three months. Shares sell for $279, so the current average price target of $281 suggests a surprisingly modest 0.7% upside. As analysts Katri and Keane indicate, however, that price target may be too low.&gt;&gt;Click Here to see the full list of MA Analyst Ratings Visa, Inc. (V) Visa shares the branded card payment processor market space with Mastercard. It’s the larger of the two companies, with a market of $394 billion, compared to MA’s $285. Visa has the higher upside at the moment, too, but like Mastercard, it’s average price target may be too low.Turning to the details, in a July 2 note Moshe Katri focused on Visa’s participation in Libra. He notes that each member will be required to fund the new crypt to at least $10 million, but that that sum is small change for a company Visa’s size. He took closer note of the regulatory aspects and growth impact that Libra membership may offer Visa: “Regulatory bodies will be looking at Libra across multiple angles, including data privacy and security and the impact of a new currency on the global financial system. Visa is expected to benefit from a new secular growth tailwind as it gains market share in electronic payments through its involvement with Libra.” Katri added that market watchers may be overestimating how much disruption Libra will cause in the online transaction segment.With intrusive regulation and a possible flop for Libra, Katri did not change his price target on V, keeping it $187 for a 3.56% upside.Keane, on the other hand, sees greater potential benefits for Visa, both from the secular trends and participation in emerging trends like crypto. He says, “The expanding market share opportunity into new account-to-account payment flows and non-interchange-based revenue models are being underappreciated.” With this in mind, he sets a $225 price target on the stock, a 27% increase over his previous target and suggesting a 24% upside to the stock.When Visa is expected to report $1.33 EPS on July 23, in its Q1 2020 earnings call. The expectation is 10.8% higher than the year-ago quarter, and like MA, continues a trend of increasing earnings.V Earnings HistoryVisa is another strong buy, having received 13 buy ratings and 1 hold in the last three months. The stocks $185 price target suggests an upside of 2.6% to the current share price of $180. While Katri believes this is about right for the stock, Keane’s target would suggest greater room on the upside.&gt;&gt;Click Here for the full list of V Analyst RatingsVisit TipRanks’ Earnings Calendar to see which companies will be reporting in coming days.",Mastercard and Visa Following Parallel Paths to Success

2019-07-16,"Despite a valuation that would give an Internet entrepreneur a nosebleed, Visa (NYSE:V) still has analysts pounding the table for it. Marketwatch, for instance, still counts 39 analysts on the Visa stock beat.  Click to Enlarge Source: Shutterstock Of that number 30 have it rated a buy, and only one has it as low as an underweight on valuation. This despite Visa being up 31% in the first half of 2019.It's extraordinary faith for a company that now has a market cap of $406 billion on $20.6 billion in 2018 revenue. Expectations are for earnings of $1.33 per share when it reports July 23, with a &quot;whisper number&quot; of $1.37 per share, on revenue of $5.7 billion.  The price to earnings ratio for the last four quarters is over 37.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong transaction processors, high valuations aren't unusual, but this is extreme. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has a market cap of $285 billion on revenue of $15 billion. Square (NASDAQ:SQ) is worth $34 billion on 2018 revenue of $3.3 billion.  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy  The Bull Case for Visa StockWhat the bulls see is the end of cash and its replacement by Visa's payment system. They also see a company with a net margin of  50%. Last year $10.3 billion of its $19.9 billion of revenue hit the net income line.Bulls say Visa continues to innovate with Visa B2B Connect, a business payment system enabling seamless payment connections between international banks.They like its purchase of privately-held Verifi, for an undisclosed price, as a way to help merchants reduce chargebacks.They love a pilot program that will let merchants offer installment payments directly from their cash registers. They're even cheering the $75 million purchase of Rambus' token and smart-ticketing business, even though that business cost Rambus itself $105 million two years ago.Quite simply, analysts believe Visa stock is unstoppable. Because its bank payment network is used by so many third-party processors, innovations that fail outside it can succeed inside it. When Visa tells other processors to jump, they still drop what they're doing to ask, &quot;How high?&quot; Visa Stock Has Real RisksThe risks with Visa are those of the global economy.This means the risks are rising. The global economy is now growing at just 2.6% per year, and the World Bank says risks are firmly on the downside. China's growth has slumped to an annual rate of 6.2% and the trade war continues to bite.Even if electronic payments are taking an ever-bigger piece of that pie, processors like Visa remain under threat on pricing and costs. India's Unified Payments Interface offers lower costs in order to reduce the use of cash there. Chinese systems like Alipay from Alibaba Group Holding (NASDAQ:BABA) cost less, too.  Nationalism is also increasing. India won't let processors take customer data outside the country.Visa is trying to get ahead of low-cost systems by joining Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra Association, but it still has enormous technology debt. Visa runs an incredibly costly network of charge agreements among banks, merchants and customers that has developed over decades and costs money to maintain. The Bottom Line on Visa StockVisa is the premier player in the global payments space, but does that make it a great investment at its current price?Square costs just 10 times revenue, and it's growing much faster. True, Square is only marginally profitable, while Visa is a profit-making machine, still growing at 10% per year. Visa looks safer.If you got into Visa as an income investor five years ago, when it was paying a dividend of nearly $2 per share on an investment of $63, your current yield is just 1.5%. It might be time to take some profits and invest them for a higher yield. Even younger investors might start looking for a good exit point. A profit is only paper until the cash is in your hand.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-17,"(Bloomberg) -- After surviving a two-day battering on Capitol Hill, now comes the hard part for Facebook Inc.: turning its 12-page white paper into a legitimate cryptocurrency in the face of deep skepticism from central banks, regulators and politicians of all stripes.David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading its blockchain efforts, spent much of his time at congressional hearings this week apologizing for the past mistakes of his employer. When he wasn’t defending Facebook, Marcus tried to explain how Libra -- the proposed currency -- would actually work. He said repeatedly that he wants to work with Congress and regulators to get Libra off the ground, and has no plans to debut the new currency before regulatory bodies are satisfied.“Nothing is launched and nothing will launch until all concerns are addressed,” Marcus said Wednesday. He reiterated a version of that promise over and over during more than six hours of testimony in Washington this week before members of the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee.Still, large existential questions remain about the project, including who or what will be regulating Libra. Marcus said it was not his place to decide who Libra’s regulator would be, though he appeared to reject the idea that Facebook should be treated like a bank. Marcus denied that the company would offer banking services, and also argued that he doesn’t believe Libra is a security that should fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission.Those issues are unlikely to be resolved soon, since the Libra currency doesn’t yet exist; and the Libra Association, the governing body made up of Facebook and other institutional partners that will be charged with overseeing the currency, has yet to be fully formed.The 28 companies that currently make up the association have not yet drafted a charter, and still must appoint a board and a general manager. Libra will also face additional concerns from international regulators and lawmakers, which could further delay its progress.In the meantime, two people familiar with Facebook’s cryptocurrency plans say the hearings did not give the company any immediate reason to change course.The people, who asked not to be identified because the planning is private, also said that Facebook’s team hoped that other members of the Libra Association would be more active in conversations with the media and with regulators. Of the group’s 28 “founding” members, including PayPal Holdings Inc., Visa Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., Facebook is the only one that testified before Congress, and is by far the company most closely associated with the effort.Over the course of the hearings, a few central questions emerged. Here’s what we know now about how Facebook and the Libra Association will try to answer them in the coming months.1&#92;. What is Libra, exactly?The coin’s legal classification remains murky, which could pose challenges for federal watchdogs eager to slide the token into the U.S.’s existing regulatory regime.Some observers have argued that Libra resembles a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that is based on an index, an investment that would be regulated by the SEC. Labeling Libra a similar product could provide policy makers the hook they need to police the coin, while also giving regulators a mechanism to slow the project down as Facebook goes through a lengthy SEC approval process.At Wednesday’s hearing, Marcus insisted the coin is a just “payment tool” or maybe a commodity that shouldn’t be subject to the SEC’s rules.2&#92;. Is Facebook getting into banking?Marcus went to great lengths in his Senate and House testimony to insist that the company was not. There won’t be bank accounts; holders of Libra won’t be earning interest; and Facebook won’t be taking deposits, he told lawmakers.“It’s like digital cash,” Marcus said. One reason Facebook wants to stay away from these activities is that they would require a federal banking charter. That would open the company up to much stricter oversight, likely by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. The company would face many new, costly regulatory requirements like capital standards and stepped-up disclosures. It would also be subject to monitoring by government examiners.3&#92;. Why is the Libra Association headquartered in Switzerland?This was a very popular question from members of both the House and Senate. Lawmakers raised concerns that Facebook set up the Libra Association in Switzerland to avoid U.S. regulations. Marcus said that was not the case, and said that the location of Libra’s headquarters had “nothing to do with us evading our responsibilities.”Marcus said that Switzerland offered Libra an “international platform” so that it would be recognized globally, and noted that Switzerland is home to other global institutions, like the World Trade Organization.4&#92;. How will Facebook make money from this?In the short term, Marcus says Libra will improve Facebook’s advertising business by increasing the amount of commerce that happens through Facebook’s products. If more people have digital wallets, they may be more likely to make purchases through Facebook or its other properties, like Instagram or Messenger. That, Marcus says, makes Facebook’s ads more valuable because it gives marketers more incentive to reach users with money at their disposal.Marcus also said that it’s possible Facebook could one day offer financial services, including, potentially, loans, but that those products would be done through partnerships with an existing bank, allowing the company to avoid opening a bank of its own.5&#92;. What, if anything, can Congress actually do to stop Libra?While both chambers of Congress are clearly concerned, whether or not they will pass any legislation that would affect the project is less clear. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, discussed a bill that would bar large tech platforms from being financial institutions -- possibly blocking Libra -- though it’s unclear how much support such a proposal would garner.Other lawmakers discussed creating a regulator just for digital currencies or using broader data privacy legislation to address Libra. But so far, there’s no consensus on a resolution. As Congress nears its August recess, it’s unlikely any of those issues will be addressed quickly.&#92;--With assistance from Austin Weinstein, Ben Bain and Robert Schmidt.To contact the reporters on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.net;Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMey, John HarneyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Is Facebook a Bank?

2019-07-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. has become the latest investor in ride-hailing giant Go-Jek as the two companies push digital payments across Southeast Asia.The world’s biggest payments network has invested an undisclosed amount in Go-Jek as part of the Indonesian company’s ongoing series F fundraising round, the two companies said Wednesday. The move follows Go-Jek’s announcement this month it had secured funding from Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank Plc, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Co.

It’s valued at $10 billion according to CB Insights, and hosts more than 20 on-demand services on its platform from food delivery to digital payments.The two companies have “a shared goal to bring formal financial services to the unbanked and underserved, including micro, small and medium businesses,” Visa Regional President Asia Pacific Chris Clark said in a statement. “We will explore ways to leverage the power of Go-Jek and Visa’s networks to expand financial access in Southeast Asia.”Visa and Mastercard Inc. have teamed up with mobile startups in Southeast Asia in recent years, where the vast majority of transactions are still cash-based and the pace of adoption of digital payments is slow.

2019-07-18,"Hardware becoming software is one of the key trends of this decade. As Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) prepares to refresh its product line for the fall of 2019, it is selling its software as a lifestyle.Source: Shutterstock The key product launch investors need to consider is the Apple Card, the company's entry into finance.While Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) wants to create its own money and replace the current Visa (NYSE:V)-dominated payment infrastructure with something cheaper, Apple Card is a gloss on MasterCard (NYSE:MA), with personal finance delivered through an app and integration with existing wireless payment technology.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsApple is also throwing money at original content, hoping to overwhelm Spotify (NASDAQ:SPOT) in podcasts and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in streaming entertainment.  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Apple's strategy is coming into focus. It's a lifestyle and an indenture. It's a walled garden where, in exchange for promises of privacy, Apple controls everything you have, including your cash flow. The Biggest iOS LaunchApple's biggest product launch is now going through its final beta test, iOS 12.4 beta 7.  Its successor, iOS 13, was announced at the June Worldwide Developer's Conference.The key new feature supported by 12.4 is the Apple Card, on which Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates it has spent nearly $275 million, transforming itself from an investment bank into a consumer bank. The card itself is designed around the app, with daily cash rewards and full integration with the Apple Wallet to track spending.The card is thus meant to change behavior, which now favors physical debit cards for most transactions. The potential bonanza here is enormous. People who pay off their cards spend an average of $1,154 with them each month, and the average user carries $6,354 of credit card debt. Goldman expects to offer $1,000 in credit to those with credit scores as low as 600, and charge Apple Card customers interest rates of 13%-24% on balances. Apple's Ho-Hum HardwareWith the next iPhone already being called a clunker, Apple has to extract more from software and services to maintain last year's 15% growth rate, with 22% of revenue hitting the net income line.The iPhone 11 design itself looks like a greatest hits album from previous iterations. Its main improvement is a bigger battery. The same is true for the latest MacBook, which only received minor tweaks on existing designs.But the hardware is the center of a software ecosystem that brings Apple profit from every corner of a customer's life. Software and services are more profitable than hardware.This extends to the Apple Watch. Given how many stores had the watch at clearance prices this month, including the Apple Watch 4, an Apple Watch 5 can't be far off. But the hardware isn't likely to change much. It will just be capable of running more software, especially health software. Health will follow cash into the Apple profit column.Critics worry the emphasis on service revenue will compromise the user experience. But people who believe in Apple tend to go all-in. The most important point about the iPhone's market share is its stability. They have half of the U.S. market and over one-fifth of the global market. The Bottom LineAn Android is a phone, a utility that offers unlimited choice. An iPhone is a lover, seducing and then demanding increasing loyalty.Once you're in the Apple ecosystem, the company wants to make it a lifestyle, handling your money, your entertainment, even your health.That's CEO Tim Cook's bet, that Apple products can be more than phones or watches or PCs, but a lifestyle for those seduced by its design and brand promise.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-07-19,"The investing public should get an idea about the performance of the payments industry as the earnings report on Visa (NYSE:V) comes out. The world's largest payments processor will report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, July 23rd after the bell. However, expectations will probably run as high as Visa stock.Source: Shutterstock As of last year, Visa controlled about 61.5% of the payment network market in the United States. Consequently, the stock has moved steadily throughout the year. However, given the valuation, the market appears to have fully priced in the market share and earnings growth of V stock. Earnings and Revenue Continue to RiseFor the quarter ending on June 30th, analysts predict Visa earnings of $1.32 per share. Should this hold, that will represent a 10% increase from the same quarter last year, when profits came in at $1.20 per share. Wall Street also projects revenues of $5.7 billion, 8.8% more than the $5.24 billion the company brought in during the third quarter of 2018.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks Top Investors Are Buying Now Visa stock has remained in a fortuitous position for some time. The demand for Visa's services continues to increase profits at double-digit rates as society becomes increasingly cashless. Visa Stock Is ExpensiveThose who hoped to buy on a dip have seen few opportunities. Visa stock fell along with the market, falling to a low of $121.60 per share on December 24th. Since then, it has moved steadily higher, climbing almost 50% since the Christmas Eve bottom. The current price of just over $180 per share comes very close to the all-time high on V stock.Unfortunately for new investors, the current price of Visa stock reflects this growth potential. The forward price-to-earnings ratio now exceeds 29. Wall Street believes that earnings will grow by 16.5% this year and 15.6% in 2020. Consequently, one can understand why V stock is not cheap.Visa stock appears expensive in more ways than one. Many at InvestorPlace seem to agree. Dana Blankenhorn says, &quot;it's time to take profits.&quot; Luke Lango calls it a &quot;long-term winner,&quot; but says it is &quot;not worthy of paying $180 per share.&quot; Even V stock bull Tom Taulli admitted valuations and pressure to reduce fees could undermine the case for Visa.These double-digit growth rates have existed for some time. This has helped the company fund ten straight years of dividend increases. However, the payout now stands at $1 per year. This takes the yield to only around to only 0.55%. That does not compare well to the average dividend return for the S&P 500, which currently stands at just under 1.9%.In fairness, investors seem to get what they pay for in this industry. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) trades at a forward P/E ratio of 31, a bit above Visa's multiple. However, analysts believe MA will post higher profit growth numbers than Visa.Some investors might prefer paying about 14 times forward earnings for American Express (NYSE:AXP). However, AXP stock barely exceeds 10% on profit growth. One can say the same about Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS). DFS stock trades at 8.7x forward earnings. However, Wall Street believes profit growth will fall below 10% after this year. Should I Buy Visa Stock Before Earnings?Despite the success of the company, investors should probably avoid Visa stock going into earnings. Without question, Visa runs the largest payment network. Moreover, thanks to the growing popularity of e-commerce and cashless payment options, its massive size has not precluded double-digit profit growth.However, at more than 29 times forward earnings, the current Visa stock price fully reflects both its value and growth. It will also account for the fact that the company will more than likely beat earnings.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) For those determined to invest in this industry, I would choose Visa stock, but not right now. I would urge investors to wait for a correction or a bear market for the S&P 500. As long as the payments industry stays in a growth mode, only a significant decline in the overall market will offer the opportunity to buy V stock at a reasonable price.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-07-19,"It's rare to find bipartisanship in today's polarized environment in Washington DC. But there is one issue that seems to unite the factions: the distrust of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and that's not good news for Facebook stock.Source: Shutterstock That's ironic. Keep in mind that FB continues to be quite popular with its users.  The company has also been aggressive when it comes to hiring and providing juicy salaries. In the first quarter, its headcount grew by 36% on a year-over-year basis to 37,773.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) But such things don't really matter much. Over the years, FB has been careless with users' data and privacy. And this has impacted views on FB within DC. After all, the company recently agreed to a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission regarding its privacy practices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet this week's testimony regarding FB's planned launch of the Libra cryptocurrency -- which has the backing of Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) -- is perhaps the most interesting evidence of the distrust towards FB from Washington.Here's what Democrat Congressman,Brad Sherman had to say: &quot;The most innovative thing that happened this century is when Osama bin Laden came up with the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers. That's the most consequential innovation, although this may do more to endanger America than even that.&quot;Yikes! Oh, and he referred to CEO Mark Zuckerberg as &quot;Zuckbucks.&quot;In the meantime, there was criticism from the other side of the aisle. For example, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Trump have expressed concerns about Libra. FB Stock and LibraDavid Marcus, who heads up the Libra project for FB, tried his best to handle the questions. He was actually fairly reasonable and understanding.  Keep in mind that Marcus said that the cryptocurrency would not be a vehicle for trading or for banking services. He added that it would also have a great deal of  transparency, helping to reduce its use in illicit activities.According to InvestorPlace.com columnist Dana Blankenhorn: &quot;The difference is that, while banks today have to police compliance at the teller's window, so to speak, Libra will make its blockchain available to police. Facebook will control neither the network, the currency, nor the reserve backing it. Its Calibra subsidiary will just be running digital wallets.&quot;Marcus also mentioned that FB would not move forward with Libra until regulators are satisfied with it.  In other words, he did demonstrate some finesse.It's difficult to predict what may ultimately happen to Libra. But given the pushback in Congress, I think the future of Libra does look dicey. Interestingly enough, the value of bitcoin has plunged recently, going from $13,000 to $9,800. The decline  indicates that investors are skeptical about Libra's future. The Bottom Line on Facebook StockThe success or failure of Libra probably does not mean a lot to FB and FB stock.  Rather, the hearings point to the ominous fact that FB does face serious political headwinds.FB's current problems with Washington look similar to those of  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) back in the 1990s, when the company came under pressure from antitrust regulators. In fact, the parallels are eerie. Both Bill Gates and Zuckerberg started their technology companies while at Harvard and subsequently cashed in on huge opportunities. Essentially, they ruthlessly created extremely powerful platforms and ecosystems which would be nearly impossible to destroy.MSFT  become an easy target. There were many companies that wanted to take it down to even the tech  playing field. As a result, MSFT had to focus more and more time and resources on battling regulators. This ultimately led to the company losing its momentum and dominance, until the past couple years.I could easily envision FB suffering a similar fate. The company has become a convenient punching bag - and for good reason.I'm not  implying that things will suddenly come undone for FB. For the most part, the company appears to be running on all cylinders. But in the years to come, it would not be surprising to see FB face more problems, making it tougher to be bullish about the long-term outlook of FB stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the upcoming book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-07-21,"As Visa, Inc.’s (V) July 23 earnings release approaches, the stock is seeing explosive growth. It gained almost 36% year-to-date, double the S&P 500’s 18% increase. As the number of non-cash payments is only expected to rise, analysts and financial bloggers are saying V is in it for the long haul. Not to mention Jefferies analyst, Trevor Williams, initiated his coverage of the stock with a Buy rating and set his price target to $210 on July 18, suggesting 17% upside potential. Is this enough to convince investors to buy Visa ahead of earnings? Expectations for Q3According to consensus estimates, the company should see quarterly revenue reach $5.7 billion, a 9% gain from the prior-year quarter. Growth for client incentives is expected to fall within the range of 22% to 23% as a percentage of gross revenues. It’s predicted that Q3 will have the highest exchange rate drag for the year at 200 basis points on net revenue and 300 basis points on EPS. However, by Q4, management believes this figure will drop to 100 basis points for net revenue and 150 for EPS. For the rest of fiscal year 2019, the company raised its expectations for EPS growth to be the high end of mid-teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis and the low 20s on GAAP nominal dollar basis. Visa Looks Strong Long-TermConsumers are relying more and more on non-cash payments as a more convenient way to pay. Over the last few years, non-cash transaction volume grew by 10% plus clip. Experts predict that this trend will continue. While cash payments are still common in developing countries, credit card usage is expected to rise as these countries adapt to the digital age. Global non-cash payments volume is expected to increase by at least 10%. A 20% plus growth rate is forecasted for emerging market non-cash payments volume. Visa has a majority stake in the market, with a $394 billion market cap compared to Mastercard, Inc.’s (MA) $285 billion. It controls 50% of the world’s card payments market excluding China.    Its volume, transaction and revenue growth rates are expected to persist as the card payments market continues to develop.    Business Model Expansion  On June 25, it was announced that V is set to acquire Rambus, Inc.’s (RMBS) token services and ticketing businesses. The technology gained from this acquisition should help Visa facilitate safer and more secure payments across all of its global commerce products. SVP, global head of payment products and platforms, TS Anil said, “Facilitating safer, more secure digital transactions is core to Visa’s brand promise and central to growing electronic payments for everyone, everywhere. As the way people and businesses pay and get paid continues to evolve, the addition of Rambus’ technology will allow us to deliver greater security beyond the card to support more transactions, payments systems and participants.” In Q3, Visa continued to expand its business model with the addition of several new product offerings. In June, the company launched new installment capabilities for cardholders. Issuers and merchants can now offer installment payment options through a buyer’s Visa card, simplifying the installment process for both buyers and sellers. In that same month, Visa released its B2B payment network, allowing financial institutions to process high-value corporate cross-border payments much more quickly. The company also announced it signed up Coinbase, a brokerage for trading Bitcoin, and partnered with the Libra Association, the governing body for Facebook's (FB) new digital currency.  Potential Valuation Problems Some investors are concerned that even with V’s strong long-term growth potential, its valuation is too high. The stock’s forward P/E ratio is 33.37, significantly higher than the industry’s average 24.66 forward P/E. Top financial blogger, Luke Lango, writes, “Visa’s EPS growth should run around 10%-15% over the next several years. At that growth rate, Visa’s EPS will settle around $11 by 2025. Based on a historically average 25 forward multiple and 10% discount rate, that equates to a fundamentally supported 2019 price target for Visa stock of roughly $170. Thus, at $180 mid-way through 2019, Visa stock seems slightly overvalued.” What are the Analysts Saying?Deutsche Bank analyst, Bryan Keane, reiterated his Buy rating while raising his price target from $177 to $225 on July 11. He believes share prices could jump by as much as 26% over the next twelve months. “Although the payment networks have a long runway to benefit from the secular growth of card-based transactions, the expanding market share opportunity into new account-to-account payment flows and non-interchange based revenue models are being underappreciated,” he said. Keane has an 80% success rate and a 22% average return per rating. Another five-star analyst from Baird, David Koning, expressed his confidence in V’s ability to sustain its growth rates. On July 19, he maintained his Buy rated and raised his price target from $182 to $196, indicating 9% upside potential. The analyst boasts an impressive 85% success rate as well as a 21% average return per rating.   The Final VerdictDespite an expensive valuation, the Street remains bullish on Visa. The stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus, with 14 Buy ratings vs 1 Hold received over the last three months. It has a $192 average price target, suggesting 7% upside potential.",Is Visa a Winning Stock This Earnings Season?

And in front of earnings this week, it's also time to keep what's yours and take profits in Visa stock. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock To say Visa shareholders have had a nice run is an understatement. Since the financial crisis low ten years ago V stock is up a staggering 1,500%, give or take 100% or so. But trends like Visa's shouldn't be taken for granted.Bottom line, all trends like Visa stock's do come to an end. I'm not simply talking about the V stock chart either. Consistent profit and sales beats over the past few years have been the norm for Visa. But taken together, that's worrisome. And considering expectations polled through crowd sourcing outfit Estimize are even higher for Visa to deliver yet again, maybe even more so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhether a corrective period or, worse yet, a bear market are the result of an actual earnings disappointment or a perceived quarterly slight from demanding expectations, the risk for holding through a report is increased in Visa right now. And from there, conditions could rightfully get a whole lot worse for Visa stock into the foreseeable future. Visa Stock Monthly ChartMost investors reminisce about owning the next big thing in technology. And no doubt gains in stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or a name like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are notoriously impressive.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Defensive Stocks For 2019 Still, as expressed above, Visa stock is no slouch either. More concerning, unlike the bull runs in AMZN, AAPL or NFLX, which have included tumultuous corrective periods to challenge even the most fervent bullish investors, V has barely been tested over the past decade.  Click to EnlargeThe closest technical test for Visa bulls was last winter's ubiquitous market correction when shares corrected by 19.62% or 2015's drop of 21% in less than two months' time. And those incidents barely constitute a bear scare which official signals at 20% or more. Bottom line, as well as simply looking at the squiggly price line of Visa stock's monthly price chart, I'd strongly caution all trends do come to an end and sometimes quite abruptly. Visa Stock StrategyGiven the nearly uninterrupted technical run Visa stock has enjoyed and shares now facing some angular trendline channel resistance, as well as a questionable stochastics set-up, taking profits in front of Tuesday night's earnings report makes prudent sense.For those investors looking to pick up long exposure in V, I'd personally wait for a more meaningful correction. And in our estimation, that correction will be one which can simultaneously test the patience of bulls, as well as reintroduce key and nearly forgotten technical supports no stock is immune from.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-24,"The markets silently marched higher on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 holding its own above the vital 3,000 mark. As we get into the thick of earnings this week, we've got movers in both directions. Let's take a closer look at some top stock trades. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Boeing  Click to EnlargeBoeing (NYSE:BA) investors are doing pretty good absorbing the fact that the company logged a multi-billion hit in the most recent quarter, given that shares are down about 3% on Wednesday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNear $362.50 and investors have a decent risk/reward setup. $360 has been a vital post-737 MAX level, while  the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages are all nearby. Further, short-term uptrend support is just below.  * 7 Stocks to Buy This Summer Earnings Season Should BA stock fall below $357, longs can bail, as $340 or lower may be on the table. If the $357 to $360 area holds as support, BA could climb to $380. Above that and $396 is possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Visa  Click to EnlargeVisa (NYSE:V) stock is holding up after earnings and investors shouldn't be too surprised by the steady nature of this stock. A move over $182 could trigger a breakout, pushing Visa to $185 and possibly higher.So long as it's holding its 20-day and 50-day moving averages though, it's hard to get bearish on this one. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Citigroup  Click to EnlargeEarlier in the month InvestorPlace readers were able to nail the breakout in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and on Tuesday, I tweeted a nearly identical setup in Citigroup (NYSE:C).With Citi breaking through resistance on Wednesday, we now need to see $72 hold as support. If it fails, see that uptrend support and the 20-day buoy the name. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Ford  Click to EnlargeThe setups today are relatively simple, which is good for investors. Ford (NYSE:F) also has the same bullish setup as Citigroup and Visa, which are ascending triangles.For Ford, a close over $10.40 could trigger more upside. On the downside, a close below the 50-day would be discouraging and likely ruin the bullish setup.**Remember, Ford reports after the close on Wednesday. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Twilio  Click to EnlargeTwilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock has a similar pattern to those above. Seeing so many of the same thing can be concerning, but until they break down, all we can do is follow the price.This one continues to hold its 20-day and uptrend support, while $150 is resistance.

2019-07-24,"Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has seen a nice boost in the past two months. Trading around $60 in early June, shares in the payment processing disruptor have soared to nearly $80 a share.Source: Shutterstock With expansion into other services, and analysts increasingly bullish on Square stock, is it time to buy?Compared to peers, SQ appears overvalued. With high expectations of growth, Square needs to deliver in order to justify its current valuation. Does Square have upside in the short term?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Read on to see whether SQ stock is a buy today. Analysts Increasingly Bullish on SQ StockThe analyst community has become increasingly bullish on Square stock. Earlier this month, Raymond James's John Davis upgraded the stock from &quot;Underperform&quot; to &quot;Market Perform.&quot; Davis initially was bearish on the company's valuation relative to growth expectations. He believes the company could see a boost in shares if second quarter earnings beat their guidance.Argus analyst Stephen Biggar is also bullish on Square's prospects. Initiating coverage earlier this month, Biggar gave the company a &quot;Buy&quot; rating, with a price target of $94 a share. Believing the company is positioned to capitalize on the migrations of payments to mobile applications, he is highly confident the company will meet sales growth expectations.But with sales slowing down, are the analysts on point? Let's take a look at Square's first quarter earnings release, and whether results will meet guidance for the second quarter. Square's Past and Future EarningsThe company had a strong first quarter, with revenue up 43% year-over-year (YoY). However, YoY revenue growth is slowing down. In the fourth quarter of 2018, YoY sales growth was 51%. With this slight slowdown, investors may be concerned that the SQ growth story is fading out.But the company has multiple avenues to expand their presence in the business services space. Thanks to the acquisition of Weebly, Square has launched Square Online Store. This platform gives Square the opportunity to seize market share from e-commerce dynamo Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).The launch of Square Invoices is another area of growth potential. By providing payments processing, online store software, and an invoicing application, Square is now a one-stop shop for the back-end needs of small businesses.SQ's Cash App also has potential to disrupt much of PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo peer-to-peer payments business. PayPal is ahead in terms of monetizing Venmo. Venmo and competitor Zelle also have stronger projected usage going into 2022. To keep Cash App from turning into an &quot;also-ran,&quot; Square has its work cut out for them.Square announces second quarter earnings in early August. Based on guidance provided in the first quarter press release, SQ estimates YoY sales growth of 43% for the second quarter. For the full year, the company also projects revenue growth of 43% in 2019 from 2018. This is an improvement over prior guidance, which projected 41% revenue growth for the year.It is clear that Square's growth is slowing down, but the business continues to compound at a rapid clip. With high growth expectations, is the company's current valuation (high premium to peers) justified? Square Stock Pricey Compared to PeersCompared to its peers, Square stock is expensive. SQ trades at a Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio (EV/EBITDA) of 1,270. Here are the EV/EBITDA ratios for Square's competitors:PayPal: EV/EBITDA of 48Mastercard (NYSE:MA): EV/EBITDA of 31Visa (NYSE:V): EV/EBITDA of 27.8Using the EV/EBITDA metric may not be relevant in determining the company's current valuation. Square is still in growth mode, and is years away from posting high operating margins. With substantial sales growth over the coming years, once the company becomes a cash generator, SQ stock's valuation should begin to trade in line with PayPal. The question is whether this current potential upside is already reflected in the current market value of Square stock ($33.6 billion market capitalization). Bottom Line: SQ Overvalued, But Could Go HigherSquare stock's valuation is due to high investor expectations. The company's payments processing business, sometimes referred to as &quot;payments as a service&quot; (PaaS) is a game changer in processing payments for small businesses. With their expansion into back-end business services (online store and invoicing software) and peer-to-peer payments, the company is becoming a stronger competitor to PayPal and Shopify.At the current trading price (around $80 a share), SQ stock could tread water from now until the next earnings call. Failure to meet high expectations could impact the stock, causing a dip (as seen after the first quarter earnings release).Investors looking for an opportunity may find a better entry point a few weeks down the road. Long-term, Square's successful disruption of the payments space could make the stock a strong performer.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-25,"Visa (NYSE:V) beat expectations on Tuesday, expectations that were relatively high to begin with. The transactions processor reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the June quarter versus analyst projections of $5.7 billion. Earnings of $1.37 per share topped the consensus forecast of $1.33 per share of Visa stock.Source: Shutterstock Revenue was up 11% year-over-year, and income grew at roughly the same pace.Yet, there's a reason shares didn't budge in response to the good news, however, even if current and would-be shareholders don't consciously realize it. As reliable as the payment middleman has been, there are too many headwinds blowing at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio Four stand out among them, even if none are particularly noticeable liabilities. Strong Dollar HurtsWhile it's true for chief rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) as well, and by and large, Visa has steered investors past the reality. Nevertheless, the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to year-ago levels is weighing on results. Last quarter's per-share earnings, for instance, would have been up 18% on a constant-dollar basis. As Visa increasingly looks to overseas markets for growth, the adverse impact of a strong greenback -- measured as nominal results compared to constant-dollar results -- will grow.  Click to EnlargeThe prospect of lower interest rates could help soften the blow, which admittedly hasn't become a stumbling block, yet. Neither is it a new dynamic.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio Still, should the Fed be mistiming its plans to drag interest rates lower and ultimately set the stage for an unexpected and unintended inflation/dollar surge, Visa's nominal results are increasingly vulnerable. Overvalued at Current V Stock PriceWall Street traditionalists are fond of saying, &quot;you have to pay for quality&quot; and Visa has unarguably delivered quality results. The premium that newcomers would have to pay for that quality right now, however, is significant.As of the latest look, Visa stock is priced at 37 times its trailing per-share earnings, and nearly 29 times its projected profits.Those aren't entirely outrageous figures. They're at the upper, extreme end of the valuation range V stock has been able to sustain since 2017 though, leaving shares open to at least a modest rethinking of what Visa stock is worth. Shares are Technically OverboughtOne has to take a big step back and look at the weekly chart to realize it, but with this month's gains, the rally that's been underway since late last year has bumped into a resistance line that extends back to early 2017. Visa stock has been able to push through overbought conditions before, but hasn't proven it can push this deep into overbought territory.  Click to Enlarge Payments are Becoming a CommodityFinally, although hardly a ticking time bomb, the former underpinnings of the payment business are shifting in a way that actually doesn't favor Visa.In its infancy, digital payments middlemen like PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) were a boon for card companies like Visa and Mastercard, which were given business they might not have otherwise garnered. The advent of Square (NYSE:SQ) only expanded the use of cards rather than cash, in that it catered to small and micro-sized businesses that had previously been unable to accept card payments of any type.Technology is now being leveraged in ways that effectively circumvent the likes of Visa and Mastercard altogether. So-called peer-to-peer (P2P) payments leave traditional credit card companies entirely out of the loop.Visa has pushed back against this trend where it could apply its best leverage, introducing a business-to-business (B2B) tool that has been given a reasonably warm reception.  * 10 Stocks to Buy From This Superstar Fund Like it has on most other fronts though, the internet is democratizing payments, establishing ways to drive costs to make and receive payments to an absolute bare minimum. Looking Ahead for Visa StockThe first three concerns are more immediate; the fourth is a longer-term issue. All are working against the company and Visa stock investors, however.Still, perspective is needed. The near-term headwinds are purely transitional or situational ones that have nothing to do with Visa's performance; there's nothing the company can do to address them. As for the commoditization undertow, it will become a bigger issue, though it's a paradigm shift that will take years to fully play out. Visa will be fine in the meantime.For traders wondering when and where Visa stock may be a name to step back into, however, the $156 area would be a line in the sand to note. V stock found a floor there several times during the second quarter, and the forward-looking P/E would be a more palatable (though still premium-priced) 25x at that level.Anything less than $156 could be considered a bargain.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

After the company recently beat average earnings expectations, investors continue to show high confidence in Visa's future prospects.But after this fantastic run, is Visa stock still a buy?At its current valuation levels, V stock price is elevated. But given macro factors that will be good for Visa's business over the long-term, V stock price could climb further.Is Visa stock still a buy? Should investors avoid V stock while the shares remain richly valued? Read on to learn the verdict on Visa stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Shutterstock  Strong Earnings Report Supports V StockOn July 23, Visa released its earnings for the quarter that ended on June 30. The company continues to post solid growth numbers. For the quarter, its sales came in at $5.8 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings per share climbed 14% YoY. The growth of global card payments continues to fuel increases in its revenues.  * 7 Oversold Stocks To Buy Right Now For fiscal year 2019, Visa anticipates revenue growth in the low double-digit percentage levels. But what are Visa's long-term growth strategies? Is it willing to look outside the box to sustain its growth? Based on recent developments, it appears Visa can continue to grow by providing new services. Cross-Border Payments Could be Key to Long-Term GrowthVisa dominates the card payments industry, with the largest global market share outside of China. But to sustain above-average growth,  Visa needs to look to new frontiers. One area of opportunity is cross-border payments.With the launch of Visa B2B Connect, the company now offers a seamless alternative to legacy bilateral networks. Traditionally, cross-border transactions required multiple hand-offs before the funds were fully transferred. But this costly, time consuming process is not compatible with today's global business environment. B2B connect uses blockchain technology to improve transparency and reduce complexity. That streamlines the whole cross-border payment process.Along with Visa's legacy competitors, many upstarts are getting into the cross-border payments space. But unlike competitors such as Ripple's Ripplenet, Visa's B2B Connect does not use cryptocurrency for transactions. Given the high volatility of cryptocurrency, financials institutions likely prefer the stability of B2B Connect. Visa's competitor, MasterCard (NYSE: MA), could also enter this space. But so far, MasterCard has focused on specific niches within B2B global payments.After the rollout of B2B Connect, does Visa have additional opportunities that can become positive catalysts for  Visa stock? Or is all the growth from the initiative already reflected in V stock price? After analyzing the valuation metrics of V stock, I believe that Visa's valuation is in-line with  its peers. Valuation: Visa Stock Richly Valued, But In Line With PeersConfident in the company's strong franchise and high operating margins, investors continue to bid up the V stock price. Similar to its peers, Visa stock trades at a premium valuation. The company's shares have a forward price-earnings ratio of 34.1. The company currently trades at an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio (EV/EBITDA) of 28.Here are the current earnings multiple valuations for Visa stock's peers:MasterCard: 36.7 times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 31.3PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL): 55.4 times forward earnings, EV/EBITDA of 48.6V stock trades at a slight discount to MasterCard stock. PayPal trades at a premium to both companies. That is understandable, given investors' high confidence in PayPal's ability to disrupt the market. Even so, the earnings multiple of V stock seems excessive.While the company continues to generate above-average revenue growth and high margins, paying a high premium for Visa stock may expose investors to material losses if its outlook deteriorates. The Bottom Line: Visa Stock Is Overvalued, But the Shares Could Continue to ClimbDespite Visa stock's rich valuation, investors continue to bid up the V stock price. Global card payments continue to grow, aided by the boom in e-commerce, as well as growth in emerging markets.Visa and MasterCard have solid franchises that give them significant moats. But with a variety of legacy competitors, along with fintech upstarts, gaining traction in the space, this advantage may be threatened over the long-term.However, Visa appears equipped to handle the challenges. With its strong brand equity and infrastructure, the company has leveraged its reputation to enter new areas of growth, such as B2B Connect. As a result, Visa could deliver above-average growth over the long-term.While in the short-term Visa stock's valuation appears excessive, it may not be smart to bet against V stock. From its past performance, it's clear that investors believe the company has a wonderful business and trades at a fair price. As the company's growth continues,Visa stock will likely appreciate, with its valuation staying level. While macro factors may lead to a valuation correction down the road, I do not expect  V stock price to drop significantly.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

In fact, the stock is setting up rather attractively. If Square stock weren't set to report earnings later this week on August 1st, it would be on most traders' radar by now.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up Because of the earnings report though, many will have to wait to see how the stock trades after the report is released. The flip side is of course, after the report is released, SQ stock could very well post a huge move -- either breaking out in big fashion or taking a noteworthy tumble.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet's look at the charts first. Trading SQ Stock  Click to EnlargeSQ stock has been on a very strong trajectory since its June lows. The stock has found itself in a solid uptrend channel (blue lines) and is making a series of higher lows. While it's hard to see because of channel support, the stock also reclaimed the 20-day moving average and is finding it as support as it pushes higher.Square stock also did a good job of bursting through prior downtrend resistance (purple line) in mid June. This was a troubling trend for SQ stock for most of 2019.However, the stock continues to butt its head up against the $82.50 to $83 level, (just as we suspected). This area has been significant over the past year, acting as support in September and resistance since Q4 2018. Can it push through now?If it can, SQ stock could run to channel resistance, and possibly overshoot it. That would take it to the $88 to $90 area. On the downside, I want to see if the 20-day can continue to buoy the name. It's relatively close, so if it can't, let's see if the 50% retracement near $75.50 can support SQ stock. Below and there's a confluence of moving average support near $70.PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) hasn't had a great reaction to earnings so far. Let's see if SQ can buck that trend. Square Earnings PreviewAnalysts currently expect Square to earn 16 cents per share for its fiscal second-quarter results. Those estimates have been steady over the past few weeks, but are down ~16% from 19 cents per share 90 days ago. That's not really too surprising, given that expectations have largely come down across the board on Wall Street.After three straight earnings misses ending in mid-2016, Square has beat earnings estimates for 11 straight quarters. Should it report in-line results this time, it will represent 23% year-over-year growth. While that's a good result for most companies, it lacks compared to the company's overall growth this year.Consensus expectations call for 69% earnings growth next quarter, along with 61% overall growth for fiscal 2019. This translates to EPS of 16 cents in Q2 and EPS of 76 cents for 2019. In this regard, guidance will be key.On the revenue front, analysts expect sales of ~$557 million this quarter, up 44.5% year-over-year. For the year, estimates call for revenue $2.28 billion, representing a similar growth rate of 43.5%. Worth pointing out is that SQ stock has beat revenue estimates for at least 14 straight quarters. Bottom Line on Square StockThe company sports trailing free cash flow of $204 million. While that's still quite small for a company with a $34.5 billion market cap, the growth has been intense. For instance, the company's trailing free cash flow is up 188% over the past year. If this can continue to trend higher, along with sales and earnings, investors may very well continue to support SQ stock.  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels If Square can continue to hold off its competitors and if the economy remains solid, then its underlying business should continue to do well. It's worth pointing out that the recent Q2 GDP report, as well as various earnings results -- such as those from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Visa (NYSE:V) -- have highlighted the strength of the consumer.That should bode well for SQ stock, although we'll find out soon enough.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-01,"A day or so before the latest Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings report my finger hovered over the sell button on my shares of Apple stock.Source: Shutterstock This is the third time I've owned Apple. I've lost money in Apple. I've missed its most spectacular moves up and, ignoring conventional wisdom, stayed for some of its most shuddering falls.I had bought soon after its disastrous fourth-quarter earnings report last November, after it had dropped from its all-time high of $230 to a more comfortable $209 per share. Since then it has been at $146 in December, and $175 last month.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMy finger hovered, but it stayed up. I decided to wait on the earnings report. It was a winner. Apple stock rose to $219.This taught me an important lesson, one worth sharing.  * 7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy as the Boom Ends  When It Comes to AAPL Stock, RelaxApple is what you call a &quot;core holding,&quot; because the iPhone represents an inflection point in the global economy.Before the late Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, the internet was a desktop thing. You reached people with the phone network. You bought things by walking into stores.That world is hard to even comprehend now. The iPhone, and its competitors, have made everyone part of the world market. Africans, South Asians, people in what were the most remote quarters of the globe, are now instantly accessible over the internet. They're part of the global conversation.This has dropped the cost of doing business to the floor. The productivity of the smartphone, combined with the cloud, has destroyed millions of jobs, putting whole industries on their back.You don't fight that. You don't time that. You just put some money into it and go about your business.When Jobs spoke, Apple had 12-month trailing revenues of $27 billion. In 2018, revenue was $265 billion. Under Tim Cook, who took over after Jobs' death in 2011, some quarters have shown year-over-year sales falling by as much as 14%.  But if you just sat tight, you have a gain of 685%, you have 7 times more shares than you did and you have a steady stream of dividends. Ignore the NoiseWe live in revolutionary times. Clouds and devices like the iPhone are the revolution.The companies behind this revolution represent core holdings you should maintain. Don't buy or sell a core holding. Just sit on it. Ignore the noise.Other companies I consider core at this time are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Visa (NYSE:V) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). A big bank like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) should be there, maybe Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). You can argue for Square (NASDAQ:SQ) or Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW).I don't hold all these stocks, but I leave the ones I do own alone. I ignore the headlines. I treat them like a piggy bank. I'll open it when I need it, not before. I'll let time do its magic for me. The Bottom Line on Apple StockThe deflationary impact of clouds and devices are the most important change of this decade.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond You must be in the stocks leading this revolution, even if it means having a portfolio that leans more heavily into technology than previously.There will be other revolutions coming, because clouds and devices accelerate the pace of all change -- social, political and economic. Given the state of the climate, that's the only hope I can give your grandchildren.Apple leads the device side of the revolution. The Apple Watch will open almost as many opportunities as the iPhone did, once its capabilities break beyond Apple's walled garden, into the larger mass market.Core holdings aren't perfect companies. But just ignore the noise and hold them. Your patience will be rewarded.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-01,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Walmart NYSE WMT will report earnings on Aug 15 before the market opens When WMT stock has strong technical momentum it tends to do quite well on a pre earnings run into the report For Walmart stock that puts,Buy Walmart Stock for a Pre-Earnings Rally
2019-08-01,"Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will report earnings on Aug. 15 before the market opens. When WMT stock has strong technical momentum, it tends to do quite well on a pre-earnings run into the report. For Walmart stock, that puts the trade in play this week, even though the company's quarterly results won't hit the tape until mid-August.Source: Shutterstock What's so nice about playing pre-earnings trades? First, we use options so our risk is completely defined. Second, this trade has a high rate of success.Working even more in Walmart's favor is the fact that the company has been doing incredibly well as of late. Shares are up 20% so far on the year. That's about in-line with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY). Also, it's almost 400 basis points higher than the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August Over the past year, WMT stock is up more than 26%. This has more than tripled both the SPY and DIA performance over that time. Trading Walmart StockThe Walmart stock price has been holding up near the $112 level for more than a week now. Admittedly, shares are below the 20-day moving average now. However, consolidating a modest pullback from the highs is attractive at this point.  Click to EnlargeWalmart is among a group of retailers that are actually doing quite well right now and holding off Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). A few of the others include Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Target (NYSE:TGT). As a result, these names have become buy-on-dips candidates. And a dip is exactly what we have in the Walmart stock price.Shares are holding over the backside of prior channel resistance (blue line). Should WMT stock fall below this mark, the next reasonable mark of support is the 50-day moving average. On a larger correction, Walmart stock should find support on a test of the $103 to $104 area.Not only was this area a big breakout zone from the last few quarters, but the 38.2% retracement for the one-year range comes into play at $104.14. Pre-Earnings Play in WMT StockLet me first start by saying that only traders comfortable with options should be using these tools as a means for trading and investing. I like to use call options in this case because I can leverage a very small amount of my portfolio (less than 1%) and look for outsized gains should it pan out.That said, those that are comfortable can consider a two-week run up to the company's report on Aug. 15. By definition, that means opening the trade today.The parameters for the trade, found using Trade Machine, also include using options that expire as close to 30 days as possible, with a delta between 40 and 50. The parameters also constitute that the trade will not be initiated unless WMT stock is above its 50-day moving average. We will use a 40% stop-loss and a 40% gain as our exit on the trade. (The software calculates both the entry and the exit at the market close).When these parameters are all satisfied, this trade has been successful three out of four times (75%) in the past year. Over the past two years, this trade has been successful six out of seven times (85.7%). And over the past three years, the trade has been a winner seven out of nine times (77.8%).Of course, past performance does not guarantee future returns. But by leveraging options on a small amount of portfolio capital, we are simply playing the odds. Just because the odds are in our favor does not mean we will win. But it's certainly better than throwing darts. Final Thoughts on WalmartWalmart stock is one of retail's anointed names. That's probably because the company is one of the few that has the money and logistics to adapt to the industry's e-commerce and omni-channel changes. It lacks the growth of TGT, HD, COST and certainly AMZN, but it will be around for decades to come.Analysts expect just 2.4% revenue growth this year but call for an acceleration to 3.3% growth next year. On the earnings front, they expect a 1.6% decline this year, but 4.6% growth in 2020 (fiscal 2021).Last quarter, the company printed a strong 3.4% comp-store sales number. While growth isn't robust for WMT stock right now, the consumer is doing quite well. The recent GDP report highlighted strong consumer spending, offsetting the lack of business investment in the economy.The earnings reports and management commentary from Visa (NYSE:V), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) all underscore a stronger consumer too.That should bode well for Walmart stock, at least in sentiment ahead of the numbers.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-01,"So there we have it. As expected, the Federal Reserve has now cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in a decade. Specifically, the Fed made a ‘mid-cycle adjustment to policy’ by trimming rates a quarter point to 2%-2.25%. However, this more hawkish language sparked fears that the Fed was not planning to embark on an aggressive rate cutting regime.  And this uncertainty sent the S&P 500 falling by as much as 1.8%. Similarly, both the tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed the day down 1.19%, as did the Dow Jones (down 1.23%). “It was a very confusing and muddled message, and I don’t think that Powell delivered clear direction for what the near term path of additional Fed easing will be, and I think that’s why the market reacted negatively,” Mark Cabana, head of US short rate strategy at Merrill Lynch told CNBC.Indeed, Chairman Jerome Powell later moved to reassure investors. At the press conference he said: “Let me be clear: What I said was it’s not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts… I didn’t say it’s just one or anything like that. When you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time and the committee’s not seeing that. Not seeing us in that place. You would do that if you saw real economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot. That’s not what we’re seeing.”So which stocks should investors snap up now to take advantage of the current pullback? Let’s take a closer look at some of the Street’s top picks now. As you will see these five stocks show a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus from the Street. That’s based on the all ratings received by each stock over the last three months: Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft dropped 3% on July 31. It is now trading down 3.16% on a five-day basis. Analysts are extremely bullish on the software giant right now. In the last three months, the stock has received 22 buy ratings vs just 1 hold rating and 1 sell rating. Meanwhile the average price target stands at $154 (13% upside potential). RBC Capital’s Matthew Hedberg bumped up his MSFT price target from $136 to $153 following the company’s stellar earnings results. Revenue of $33.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year (Y/Y), easily beat the consensus estimate of $32.7B (+9%). Hedberg cited impressive commercial bookings growth strength (+22% Y/Y) driven by larger, longer-term contracts and significant improvement in Azure gross margins.“Multi-year growth engines of O365 and Azure continue to show fundamental strength, and margin expansion across Commercial Cloud is continuing with scale and execution” cheered the analyst.  Amazon (AMZN)E-commerce king Amazon is trading down 7% on a five-day basis. That’s with a 2% drop on July 31. Shares are falling not just due to the Fed rate cut, but also in the wake of Amazon’s earnings upset. However, all 29 analysts polled are bullish on AMZN’s prospects- suggesting now is the perfect time to buy on the dip. Indeed the $2,281 average analyst price target suggests sizable upside potential of 22%AMZN reported strong Q2 and year-over-year sales gains coming in above trend and greater than Street consensus expectations. However, a significant incremental investment to increase delivery speed and supply chain improvements caused a shortfall in earnings.“We view the recent weakness as a buying opportunity as Amazon continues to exhibit its ability to leverage its advanced technology infrastructure to drive new industry verticals and incremental sales growth” wrote five-star Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on July 30. “The strong results come as Amazon continues to invest in its warehouse delivery infrastructure as part of its plan to make one-day shipping standard for Prime members” he added.  Visa (V)Now is the time to snap up Visa Inc- which has a very positive outlook according to the Street. On the back of strong earnings, the stock is trading up 35% year-to-date. However, in the last five days we see a 3% pullback, with a 2% drop on July 31. Visa’s fiscal third quarter earnings report beat on both profit and revenue- leading to a wave of bullish Street sentiment. Currently the stock displays a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus with 18 buy ratings and just 1 hold rating. Its average analyst price target works out at $199 (12% upside potential). For instance, SunTrust Robinson analyst Andrew Jeffrey reiterated a buy rating on V with a $205 price target. He describes Visa as &quot;a core holding&quot; and &quot;the most valuable global payments asset.&quot; Most &quot;third-party wallets, e-commerce and mobile solutions ride Visa's rails,&quot; the analyst told investors.Meanwhile Nomura Instinet’s Bill Carcache believes Visa remains &quot;uniquely positioned&quot; to sustain mid-teens annual earnings growth despite an uncertain macro backdrop.  UnitedHealth (UNH)One of the US's largest insurance companies, UnitedHealth sold off 2% on rate-cut day. And even though the stock is now flat year-to-date, analysts are staying firmly bullish on UNH’s prospects. Out of ten analysts covering the stock, 9 rate UNH a buy. The average analyst price target is now at $303 (22% upside potential). Shares remain attractive says Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper. &quot;With Medicare for All noise subsiding, we believe Managed Care sentiment is improving. We continue to believe UNH is attractively positioned given its integrated model and consistent execution. Our price of $310 represents almost 20% upside from current levels&quot; the analyst wrote on July 19.Following the company’s solid earnings report, the analyst noted strong growth from both UnitedHealthcare (UHC) and Optum. Notably total Optum revenue grew 13.4% Y/Y, while UNH indicated that its outlook for Medicare Advantage remains &quot;exceptional&quot;. Comcast (CMCSA)Last but not least comes blue chip telecoms giant Comcast. The stock also saw a 2% selloff on the Fed news, bringing shares 4% lower on a five-day basis. Still, year-to-date gains work out at 27%- and the stock holds a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus from the Street. Indeed, all seven analysts polled rate CMCSA a buy right now.On the back of recent earnings, Rosenblatt’s Bernie McTernan hitched his price target slightly from $50 to $51, while maintaining his bullish call. The analyst stated, &quot;Strong results in 2Q19 and higher cable guidance reinforces our thesis on shares that broadband share gains will continue to drive growth and margin expansion despite a potentially worsening video environment as cord cutting appears on the rise following results from Comcast and AT&T.”“With a bright outlook for broadband revenue growth, Comcast is not as levered to cord cutting pressures as some other media peers... We are increasing our FCF estimates driven by a slightly higher EBITDA forecast and lower capex, this lifts our price target higher to $51 from $50&quot; he concluded.Discover the Street’s Best-Rated Trending Stocks now",5 Hot Stocks to Buy After Fed Rate Cut

2019-08-05,"Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day so far this year. The index containing 30 American blue-chip stocks, posted its largest one-day percentage loss since December, with it falling 767 points or 3%. The August 5 drop comes after China answered Trump's tariff threats with another escalation of the trade war. China allowed the Yuan to fall to its lowest level in over a decade and told state-owned companies to suspend imports of U.S. agricultural products. In response to this move, the U.S. then labeled China as a &quot;Currency Manipulator&quot;. This decline follows the Dow's previous 1% drop on July 31, which occurred after the Federal Reserve sent mixed messages regarding whether or not it would cut interest rates further. All of this has led to a great degree of economic uncertainty. However, some analysts believe that a few Dow stocks look poised to not only withstand the current climate but also to outperform. Here are 3 top rated Dow Jones stocks that analysts are saying make compelling investments even in an uncertain economic climate.  Visa, Inc. (V)Despite a 2% drop in the last three days, the payment processing giant is looking strong. Visa’s long-term growth prospects appear unchanged as the number of consumers relying on non-cash payments to make purchases is only growing. Global non-cash payments volume is expected to increase by at least 10%. Not to mention the company has continued to expand and diversify its product pipeline. On July 17, Visa announced that it will acquire payment gateway software company, Payworks. This technology will allow V to create a white-labeled omnichannel payment management platform for in-store, in-app and online purchases. Earlier in June, the company also launched new installment capabilities for cardholders and released its B2B payment network that allows financial institutions to process high-value corporate cross-border payments much more quickly.  Five-star analyst, Josh Beck, said, “Visa's momentum in the core business is coupled with recent M&A deals and organic momentum as evidence by a triple-digit transaction growth in Visa Direct suggests Visa has a long growth path ahead and investors should be buyers of the stock.” On July 24, the KeyBanc analyst reiterated his Buy rating while raising his price target from $190 to $195, suggesting 10% upside. He has an 82% success rate and gets an average return of 26% per rating.Another top analyst, Brett Huff, sees more upside for Visa based on its robust pipeline of renewals and new deals as well as its better-than-expected foreign exchange impact on full-year revenue and EPS. On July 29, he reiterated his Buy rating and raised the price target from $185 to $190, indicating 7% upside potential. The Stephens analyst boasts an impressive 90% success rate and average return rate of 33% per rating. The Street remains bullish on Visa. The stock has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $202 average price target, suggesting 14% upside potential.  McDonald’s Corporation (MCD) The second Dow stock on our list gained 1% in the three days following the Fed’s announcement. With the fast-food chain up 21% year-to-date, MCD looks poised to serve investors with continued growth.  Steve Chiavarone of financial services company, Federated Investors, argues that fast-food companies stand to benefit from the current economic backdrop. “Low unemployment, rising wages and low gas prices mean more money in consumers’ pockets, which means the consumer is going to show up and dine out with frequency,” he said. MCD has also shifted focus towards expanding its digital initiatives in an attempt to attract younger customers. Management attributes the second quarter same-store sales growth to tech-focused store renovations. On July 26, MCD reported U.S. same-store growth was 5.7%, beating the 4.5% consensus estimate.    The company is expanding upon these efforts, with it planning to invest $1 billion dollars during fiscal 2019 to modernize its American locations. By 2020, all U.S. restaurants will have self-service ordering kiosks. Also inspiring confidence, McDonald’s announced in March that it would acquire AI software company, Dynamic Yield, to help it gain actionable insights from the data it collects.“We like McDonald's heightened focus on digital initiatives, which should yield benefits near and long-term, and believe ongoing momentum should continue to support a premium to its historical valuation,” Credit Suisse analyst, Lauren Silberman, said on July 30. She reiterated her Buy rating and raised her price target from $230 to $236, suggesting 10% upside potential. The analyst boasts a 75% success rate. Top financial blogger, Luke Lango, adds, “The premium valuation underlying MCD stock is warranted by strengthening fundamentals and a favorable market backdrop, as the company is firing on all cylinders as rates plunge to new lows. So long as the company continues to do so — and so long as rates remain low — MCD stock should stay on a healthy uptrend.”The Street is cautiously optimistic about MCD. It has a ‘Moderate Buy’ analyst consensus and a $228 average price target, suggesting 6% upside.  Chevron Corporation (CVX)While shares have declined 3% in the three days after the rate cut, investors shouldn’t abandon Chevron just yet. On August 2, Chevron reported that its second quarter profits jumped 26% as a result of higher oil and gas production. Daily oil and gas production grew 9% from the year-ago quarter to a record breaking 3.08 million barrels. U.S. shale production also increased by 21% in the quarter. Its results were improved by the one-time $1 billion payment it received after Occidental Petroleum ruined its deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum. Despite not closing the Anadarko Petroleum deal, the company remains committed to expanding its portfolio, specifically its liquified natural gas (LNG) prospects.  “We’re always working the portfolio, and LNG is one of the asset classes that we're interested in, and we will pursue opportunities in that space,” CFO Pierre Breber said. Morgan Stanley analyst, Devin McDermott, said, “The current market obsession with oil-sector (free cash flow), dividends and buybacks plays well to (Chevron’s) strengths.” On July 12, he reiterated his Buy rating and lowered his price target from $146 to $144. Even with the price target drop, the analyst still believes share prices could rise by as much as 19% over the next twelve months. CVX has a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus and a $140 average price target, suggesting 16% upside.",3 Top Dow Jones Stocks Amid Economic Uncertainty

2019-08-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- No matter how many times you’ve ridden it, when your log-flume boat is clicking its way up the track to the final brow of Splash Mountain, the jitters set in. Soon you’ll be hurtling down five steep stories, getting doused at the bottom.And that’s how it feels to be a Walt Disney Co. shareholder right about now. Disney reported earnings on Tuesday that fell short of analysts’ lowest estimate as the company takes the TV-streaming plunge. Investments in its Disney+ online-video app and its recent takeover of 21st Century Fox predictably weighed on results. But lighter attendance at its U.S. theme parks didn’t help matters, nor did its write-down of “Dark Phoenix,” a film flop the company inherited in the Fox deal. The strength of Disney’s theme-park and movie businesses – i.e., its new “Star Wars” attractions and record-shattering year at the box office – are what’s supposed to be distracting from its other costly endeavors. Instead, its shares sold off in after-hours trading. Creating Disney+ and buying Fox are decisions viewed positively – necessary even – by investors, but they’re still certain to be disruptive to its financial performance and usual internal harmony in the coming periods. Tuesday’s results are the start of that. The company’s new direct-to-consumer (aka streaming) and international division recorded $553 million in operating losses in the three months ended June 29. That figure may grow to $900 million in the current quarter, Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, said on the earnings call. It’s been no secret that Disney was about to take shareholders on a thrill ride – it was literally my column headline in March, and Disney held up a big PowerPoint slide in April warning that this little streaming adventure wouldn’t turn a profit until fiscal 2024:The good news for investors is that the closer it gets to Disney+ launch day on Nov. 12,  the clearer it’s becoming that Disney poses a significant threat to the market incumbent, Netflix Inc., and is making the right move to bet that streaming is the future. Among the many milestones Disney had in the latest quarter, the company took full operational control of Hulu, a step toward being able to offer a discounted bundle for viewers who want Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+, a combo that at $12.99 a month starts to look like a fairly decent replacement on its own for a traditional cable package. That’s in line with a Netflix standard subscription. Disney can also draw on its incredibly large fan base, whether it be Vacation Club members, Disney Visa cardholders or theme-park patrons, to promote its streaming products in a way that its rivals can’t. There are challenges ahead, such as supplying enough fresh streaming content to attract and retain subscribers. Its added scale with Fox and Hulu give it an advantage, and the Disney+ monthly rate is already less than half what AT&T Inc.’s HBO Max service is expected to price at when it launches in the subsequent months. If in a quarter when Disney released the highest-grossing film of all-time, “Avengers: Endgame,” it still couldn’t ease shareholders’ concerns, then the next few quarters aren’t going to be very exhilarating either. In a year’s time, though, investors may finally be drying off and rounding the corner to Doo-Dah Landing.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., media and telecommunications.

WalletHub Analyst Jill Gonzalez joins Yahoo Finance's Zack Guzman and Emily McCormick, along with Gaby Dunn, &quot;Bad With Money&quot; author and podcast host, to discuss.",Moms are 3.6 times more likely to give their kids a credit card: survey
2019-08-06,"After a day of complete debacle on Wall Street where the S&P 500 fell over 3% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 5%, it's hard to conceive that anyone would want to look at any stocks from the long side. But this is what we're doing today because there are quality stocks that got caught up in the headline trading. Specifically, fintech stocks like Visa (NYSE:V) MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Square (NYSE:SQ) were unfairly punished.Source: Shutterstock The banking sector as represented by the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) fell -3% on Monday. In comparison, V stock fell 5%, MA stock fell about the same, and SQ stock almost 7%.These are proven winners that have business models that will survive the current headlines from the U.S. versus China economic war. So the selling was overdone.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe business of fintech stocks relies heavily on transactions being electronic. To that, this is an ongoing migration from paper to electronic. It is global and happening at an exponential rate. There are no signs of it reversing, so the transaction demand from these three companies will only increase for years to come.Barriers-to-entry are high so there are only a handful of competitors so MA, V and SQ stocks are the ones to bet on.In general, when the stock market falls the best practice is to sit back and do homework. The goal is to find stocks that have retraced the last rally and are now falling into support.Visa, MasterCard and Square stocks all fulfill this requirement and then some. Valuations in these growth stocks almost don't matter, but even here, there's some good news for the bulls.It is impossible to pin an actual bottom, especially because we continue to be in headlines trading mode. Investors are selling stocks indiscriminately and in panic after tweets from the White House or a press releases from the Chinese state media. So this is when homework falls hostage to headlines. But long term, the fundamentals will prevail.  * 7 Biotech ETFs That Should Remain Healthy While all three fintech stocks look good for a bounce trade, this doesn't eliminate the fact that they could still see lower lows in the next few days. The general stock market is still having a crisis of sentiment which usually punishes the good and the bad stocks alike. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock Including the Monday drop, V stock fell a total of 10% from the recent highs. This constitute a full correction by Wall Street standards. Nevertheless this doesn't mean that it's a bottom. Year-to-date, Visa stock is still up 35% so there is plenty of fresh winnings to give back if the bears press the issue.However, I do like the technicals here which suggest that V has fallen into short-term support levels. These are more so zones than hard lines in the sand. Visa broke out to new highs from $165 in June and this dip merely revisits the neckline. Often, the bulls need to test the footing from which they broke out before they set higher highs.Albeit, this retest materialized too fast and too deep for this to be a clear bottom but it's worth a shot. Nevertheless, I think that in the long run, buying V stock at these levels should reward investors.   MasterCard (MA)Source: Shutterstock MA stock is in a similar boat as Visa. They trade in lockstep. And after setting highs recently, MasterCard stock also fell almost 5% on Monday. Valuations for both of these stocks are similar as they both trade near a 40 trailing price-to-earnings ratio.This is not cheap in absolute terms since it's about double that of Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). But this has always been the case. These are growth stocks that are proven winners and I doubt that a few bad headline trading days will change that fact.  * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now MA stock also has fallen into its support band centered around $245 per share. This too is more of a zone than a hard line in the sand. And since they don't ring bells at bottoms it is impossible to take full positions in either of these two and be confident of short-term wins. But for the long term, I bet that owning MA at these levels will be profitable -- especially for patient investors. Square (SQ)Source: Shutterstock SQ stock is lagging our other two fintech stocks year-to-date. This last earnings report caused a bit of enthusiasm going into it. But sadly for the bulls the trade was to sell-the-news after buying the rumor.The SQ $83 per share remains a tough failure level to watch for the next big trigger long. But now it has fallen into support. Square stock has almost priced out the entire June rally so the bears have had their way with it. This brings price back into a pivot level. Those tend to be supportive because the bull and bears would want to fight it out hard again. This creates congestion and an opportunity for the SQ stock bulls to buy it and restart a rally.Fundamentally, SQ stock is the most expensive of the three fintech stocks from a P/E perspective since it still loses money. But it sells at nine times sales and that's half V or MA. Regardless, SQ is still the new kid on the block so it's supposed to spend more to grow into its valuation.Of the three fintech stocks, I consider going long V or MA a conviction buy trade versus SQ more of a speculative one.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-08,"No need to do a double-take on that headline. U.S. stocks really did rally today thanks in large part to some surprisingly strong economic data out of China.The world's second-largest economy said exports jumped 3.3% last month while economists were expecting a 2% drop. Even amid the trade hostilities with the U.S., Chinese imports also fell less than expected in July.Sure, that was just one data report out of China and there is a very real possibility that the U.S. and its rival will butt heads again on trade, but for today, news that the Chinese economy remains firm was enough to lift riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates Buoyed by a resurgence in tariff-sensitive technology stocks, the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.24% while the S&P 500, where technology is also the largest sector, jumped 1.88%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished higher by 1.43%.Let's have a look at some interesting takeaways from the Dow today. Be Careful With This Dow SurpriseI've frequently mentioned industrial machinery maker Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) in this space and with good reason. Caterpillar is highly tariff-sensitive and is lower by nearly 5% this year, making it one of the worst-performing names in the Dow.Somehow, shares of Caterpillar added 1.03% Thursday even after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; while lower its price target on the shares to $130 from $156.Goldman &quot;believes rising inventories of trucks and construction machines will lead to production cuts in 2020. That will hurt next year's earnings for these companies. And higher inventories is another sign the global industrial economy is slowing down,&quot; reports Barron's.Analyst upgrades and downgrades are not gospel, but as it pertains to Caterpillar, it's hard to endorse the stock with trade tensions running high and the aforementioned factors cited by Goldman very much in play. Rebound Starting?Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is another name that has been getting some run here in recent days. Long story short, I've pointed out that the stock usually falls after earnings reports and that happened yesterday, but there is no shortage of support for Disney shares.The stock surged 2.29% today after Credit Suisse upgraded the ESPN owner to &quot;outperform&quot; while boosting its price target on the shares to $150 from $130, implying some decent upside from Disney's Thursday close around $137. Careful With the HeadlinesOn light news, Visa (NYSE:V) jumped 2.61%, good for one of the Dow's better performances today. I always try to be careful here when it comes to politics, the all views are welcomed policy remains in effect, so I'll just give to you straight about Visa: In an interview with CNBC, CEO Alfred Kelly said Visa will not ban customers from buying firearms with Visa-branded credit and debit cards.However, I doubt those comments sparked the stock today as fellow Dow component American Express (NYSE:AXP) and rival MasterCard (NYSE:MA) both gained on the day, too. Bottom Line on the Dow: Recession RiskNot to be the bearer of bad news, but economists are forecasting a rising risk of recession. That percentage is up to 35% from 31% last month, according to Bloomberg. Those same prognosticators are also saying U.S. GDP growth will average 2.3% this year, down from the prior estimate of 2.5%.Still, they're saying the recession probably won't start until 2021. For investors looking for some silver lining, the U.S. consumer remains healthy and it's hard to envision a recession against that backrdop. Plus, not to be trite, but economists are often wrong.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-08,"Gun control news for Thursday includes Visa (NYSE:V) not blocking the use of its payment cards for firearm purchases.Source: Shutterstock That bit of gun control news comes directly from Via Chairman and CEO Alfred Kelly. He claims that it isn't the company's duty to tell people what they can and cannot purchase. He went on to say that it would be a &quot;very slippery slope&quot; for the company.According to Kelly, Visa is interested in fair commerce that respects the laws of the land. As such, it won't limit what holders of its cards buy, so long as it is legal. He provides a comparison by saying Visa shouldn't limit the size of soft drink a person buys or acquisitions of legal recreational drugs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the recent gun control news may make some think Kelly is in favor of firearms, this doesn't appear to be the case. Instead, he simply believes that it is up to legislators to handle the matter. He calls for them to pass common sense gun control laws and other restrictions on firearms, reports CNBC.  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates The idea of pressuring payment companies to ban gun sales has been tossed around before, but it doesn't stand much of a chance. This is due to how those companies handle payments. They don't see the individual items that customers are purchasing, rather just where they are buying them from. This means that if someone bought a gun at Walmart (NYSE:WMT), for example, it wouldn't show up as a firearm purchase, MarketWatch notes.V stock was up 2% as of noon Thursday.

2019-08-08,"Amid widespread calls for companies to do more to combat gun violence, Visa has announced it has no plans to block gun purchases. No Credit In an interview with CNBC, Visa Chairman and CEO Alfred Kelly said the company has no plans to prevent customers from using their credit cards to purchase of firearms. Visa is one of the biggest credit card and financial service companies in the world. Lay It On The Law Kelly said that he felt like his hands were tied here, as he worried that once his company starts banning what consumers can buy, where does it end? &quot; If we start to get in the mode of being legislators it’s a very slippery slope,” he said. &quot;We shouldn’t tell people they can’t purchase a 32-ounce soda. We shouldn’t tell people they can’t buy reproductive drugs.&quot; He instead punted the issue over to lawmakers. Kelly is not alone in this regard, as earlier this year Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga also said it is not his company's job to limit gun sales. All Square After last weekend’s pair mass shootings, there has been a great push for business leaders to do more to combat the spread of guns, and there are a number of companies that have already made some steps. Newer, more-internet based payment services PayPal and Square do not allow customers to use them for gun purchases, and Apple won’t allow Apple Pay to be used to purchase guns and ammunition online, though the service does still work for in-store purchases. -Michael Tedder Photo via Visa.com",Visa Won’t Block Gun Purchases

2019-08-13,"Editor's note: &quot;5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.If you're like me, the current bout of trade-induced volatility isn't sitting too right. And while swings and bear markets are a part of investing, the kind of big plunges we've recently seen does make for some sleepless nights. Which is why the best stocks to buy could be America's blue-chip stocks.Blue-chip stocks don't necessarily have a formal definition, but they are generally stable and well-established companies. Blue-chip stocks are typically household names with billions in revenues and steady rising profit profiles. Often, they share the wealth with their investors via rich dividend and buyback programs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The best part is that investors can count on blue-chip stocks to help them get through periods of malaise and bear markets as they tend to be less volatile than let's say, smaller growth stocks. To that end, with the markets starting to feel a bit shaky, blue-chip stocks could be the best way to position your portfolio in the upcoming months.But which blue-chip stocks make sense to buy? Here are five that could help you get through the next few months and an upcoming bear market. Cisco Systems (CSCO)The technology sector is often seen as a growth element for a portfolio. However, the sector does feature plenty of blue-chip stocks that produce mountains of cash flows, steady dividends, and rising profits. Case in point, former dot-com darling Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).Source: Shutterstock After building the internet and networking with its focus on switching gear and routers, CSCO made the smart pivot into services and reoccurring revenues. It basically created the model that many tech firms have copied.And in doing that, Cisco has become a cash generation machine. Last quarter alone, the firm managed to produce more than $3.5 billion in free cash flows.The best part is that CSCO continues to share that cash with investors. The firm recently raised its dividend by 6% and added another $15 billion to its authorized buyback program.And yet, more could be in store for Cisco. The firm continues to add new capabilities to its services platform and recently unveiled new conversational A.I. to its interfaces. Adding in continued data center demand as well as the pending 5G upgrades and Cisco continues to look great.For investors looking for a strong tech sector blue-chip stock, Cisco has to be your top pick. Merck (MRK)The steadfastness of the healthcare sector makes it a prime place to find plenty of blue-chip stocks. And one of the best could be pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK).For starters, MRK features a wide portfolio of current and former blockbuster drugs, vaccines and other therapies. This huge portfolio continues to drive profits and cash flows at the giant. But MRK isn't resting on its laurels. A few years ago, Merck made the shift into newer biotech and advanced cancer-fighting medications. That has turned out to be the right move.MRK's Keytruda has quickly become the go-to medicine for a variety of lung cancers and sales going through the roof. Last quarter alone, the company reported more than $2.2 billion in Keytruda sales.That double-digit growth has allowed Merck to up its total forecast and guidance for the entire year.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The growth of Keytruda could continue. Merck has begun several trials looking to use the drug in other indications. This could provide even more cash flowing Merck's way. Considering the growth of its cancer portfolio and the rest of its steady drug options, Merck is looking like a great buy for the long haul.In the end, MRK's 2.5% yield and continued growth make it a powerful blue-chip stock for any investor. American Express Company (AXP)One of Warren Buffett's favorite blue-chip stocks happens to be American Express (NYSE:AXP). And the Oracle of Omaha isn't wrong to own it. The financial powerhouse has continued to thrive in the rising economy and has a lot to offer investors.Source: Shutterstock AXP is kind of a weird bird. Like its rivals, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) (two blue-chip stocks also worth owning), American Express operates a secured payment network and acts as a toll road when customers swipe their cards. Here, Amex scores a hefty fee.The firm's discount revenue rate was last quarter was 2.37%. Basically, for every $100 spent on its cards, $2.37 flowed back to AXP. All in all, last quarter, American Express pulled in more than $6.2 billion in revenue from these operations.Secondly, unlike V and MA, American Express is an issuer of its cards. Because of this, it's able to score hefty membership fees, interest and creates a leverage effect for its profits. Moreover, Amex's entire M.O. is about rewards and its partners pay the credit issuer plenty of fees to get their products/offers onto AXP's platform.The best part is that AXP tends to focus on the higher end of the credit spectrum. This removes many of the uncertainty and issues with offering loans and reduces default rates.All of this has made American Express a powerhouse in the financial sector. Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Sixty-three years. That's an amazing streak for any firm to consistently raise its dividend. But for blue-chip stock Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), it's just par for the course. The secret lies with the firm's massive and irreplaceable moat.Source: Shutterstock There's a good chance that you've never walked into one of GPC's locations, but your mechanic has. Under the NAPA banner, the firm operates one of the largest networks of auto parts and industrial distribution locations in the nation.Those 9,250 locations are located pretty much everywhere, and that's key. Auto parts are generally a &quot;need it now&quot; sort of item and are pretty much immune from the whims of online sales.Because of this huge network, GPC and NAPA are pretty much the only game in town when it comes to getting parts to body shops, mechanics and service centers. This has been beyond good for GPC's bottom line over the years. In its 90-year history, sales have increased in 85 of those years.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What This streak was continued last year as GPC recorded more than $18.7 billion in revenues. Analysts predict that revenues will jump by about 4% this year. Naturally, those sales have turned into profits and a long streak of dividend increase for investors.This consistency has made GPC one of the best blue-chip stocks to own for the long haul. Coca-Cola (KO)When it comes to blue-chip stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) could be the bluest. Its brand is worldwide and is enjoyed millions of times daily. This has allowed KO to pay a constantly rising dividend for the last 55 years and provide plenty of ballast to a portfolio in markets just like today.Source:  Chris Nielsen via FlickrAnd there is still growth to be had.Coke has moved into new beverage categories as tastes have changed. Sparkling water, juices, teas, and other healthy drinks are now on a menu at the firm.And these items continue to grow, with revenues for these products now accounting for about half of KO's total pie. Meanwhile, KO has improved margins via new packaging designs and sizes. Adding in some tech -- such as its Arctic Coolers and Freestyle machines -- and Coke seems to be winning the beverage wars.The proof is in the pudding. Continued product mix development has resulted in a big 5% jump in revenues last quarter. Likewise, earnings saw a big surge and KO has managed to produce roughly $6.28 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.Yes, KO is boring. But that's what exactly what investors should be looking for in a blue-chip stock. Consistency, with a touch of growth. If that doesn't describe Coca-Cola, then I don't know what does.Disclosure: At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not have a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-08-19,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges is looking to partner with governments and companies to develop new digital currencies as it competes with the Libra project spearheaded by Facebook Inc.To that end, Malta-based Binance said it plans to create an independent “regional version of Libra,” the digital coin being developed by Facebook Inc. and partners, in a Chinese-language statement on its website Monday. The firm run by Chief Executive Officer Zhao “CZ” Changpeng said its open blockchain project, Venus, is intended to “empower developed and developing countries to spur new currencies.’’Developing so-called stable coins like Tether that are pegged to the U.S. dollar or another traditional currency has become a goal for many crypto platforms. Traders have flocked to these lower-volatility coins as they can be used to facilitate transactions and to park funds during wild swings in prices.Unlike Facebook, which announced its Libra coin with 27 partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. signed up, Binance did not say if any other players have signed up to Venus. Instead the company said it “welcomes additional government partners, companies and organizations with a strong interest and influence on a global scale to collaborate with us to build a new open alliance and sustainable community.’’Binance already has experience with stable coins, having issued a token pegged to the U.K. pound earlier in the year. The exchange says it handles an average $1.2 billion of trading volume a day.Crypto firms have not only struggled to maintain stability in coin prices, but also with security in holding the digital assets. In May, Binance said hackers withdrew 7,000 Bitcoins worth about $40 million in a “large scale security breach.”&#92;--With assistance from Shiyin Chen.To contact the reporter on this story: Alastair Marsh in London at amarsh25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Hertling at jhertling@bloomberg.net, Todd White, Sid VermaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Crypto Behemoth Binance Is Planning a Rival to Facebook’s Libra

2019-08-20,"(Bloomberg) -- European Union antitrust regulators are already probing Facebook Inc.’s two-month-old Libra digital currency project, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.The European Commission is &quot;currently investigating potential anti-competitive behavior&quot; related to the Libra Association amid concerns the proposed payment system would unfairly shut out rivals, the EU authority said in a questionnaire sent out earlier this month.Officials said they’re concerned about how Libra may create &quot;possible competition restrictions&quot; on the information that will be exchanged and the use of consumer data, according to the document, which is a standard part of an early-stage EU inquiry to gather information.The investigation into founder Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitions to take on traditional cash adds to another preliminary EU investigation into how Facebook may unfairly use its power to squeeze rival apps. The Brussels-based commission, Europe’s most feared regulator, has already targeted Google and Apple Inc.Facebook and the commission both declined to comment on the investigation. The Menlo Park, California-based company has previously promised to appease all regulators before launching the cryptocurrency, a process that could take some time.Global CurrencyLed by a social network with more users than the combined population of China and the U.S., Libra represents a potential challenge that the guardians of money have never faced: a global currency they neither control nor manage.The EU questionnaire said regulators are also examining the possible integration of Libra-backed applications into Facebook services such as WhatsApp and Messenger. It said their investigation focuses on the governance structure and membership of the Libra Association.Facebook has previously promised to appease all regulators before launching the cryptocurrency, a process that could take some time.Visa Inc. declined to comment while the Libra Association representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Mastercard Inc. had no immediate comment.Aside from the antitrust division, other EU regulators are &quot;monitoring market developments in the area of crypto assets and payment services, including Libra and its development,&quot; a spokesman for the commission’s financial services department said.Data-protection supervisors are also worried about how Libra will share information.

2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For 47 years, the Business Roundtable has lobbied on behalf of corporate America. Much of that time, it maintained a fiction(1) -- that the sole purpose of a corporation was to maximize profits on behalf of shareholders. This philosophy has been under assault for several years now, and this week the Business Roundtable announced it wants to put it to rest.In a widely circulated memo, the 200-member organization reversed itself, writing that &quot;shareholder primacy” is no longer the sole purpose of a corporation. Instead, corporations must include a commitment to “all stakeholders,” which includes customers, employees, suppliers and local communities.Some kudos are in order for JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, and chairman of the Business Roundtable, for driving these changes. He has been discussing the need for a more inclusive form of capitalism, both in public speeches and in his letters to shareholders, for some time.But turning this aircraft carrier around won’t be easy, in large part because of the group's own history. Indeed, the Roundtable has spent most of the past four decades advocating against the interests of those exact stakeholders. To cite some of the more notable examples:&#92;-- It fought the rise of labor unions and pro-union legislation;&#92;-- Helped to defeat antitrust bills;&#92;-- Prevented the formation of the Consumer Protection Agency;&#92;-- Opposed corporate governance changes to make boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders;&#92;-- Fought proper accounting of stock options given as compensation to executives and insiders;&#92;-- Opposed increases in the national minimum wage (it now favors increases);&#92;-- Lobbied to prevent restrictions on executive compensation;&#92;-- Fought legislation that would create cleaner energy and address climate change;&#92;-- Pushed for corporate income-tax cuts;&#92;-- Supported anti-consumer Supreme Court decisions, including the fiction that corporations are legal people, and that campaign donations equal speech.   The Roundtable might respond that this is all in the past. Let’s hope so. But the organization has an even greater challenge: Scan the list of 181 signatories to the recent memo and it's a Who’s Who of corporate behavior that has burdened and disadvantaged the very stakeholders they will now champion.Consider a few of the signatories:&#92;-- Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.:  Two of the most valuable companies in the world are famously effective at using various tax dodges to avoid paying their fair share. I can recall when the Internal Revenue Service went after maneuvers that serve no valid business purpose other than tax avoidance. Consider that what isn't paid in tax by those who avoid them must be made up for by those who do -- mostly average Americans who also happen to be customers of these companies.The share of federal tax revenue paid by corporations has dropped by two-thirds in the past seven decades -- from 32% in 1952 to 10% in 2013; and corporate income tax as a share of gross domestic product has fallen from about 6% in 1946 to about 1.5% today.&#92;-- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co.: Show good faith -- working with card-issuing banks as needed -- by simplifying the incomprehensible small print in the cardholder agreement and spell out in clear language the terms and penalties for late payment. Second, do the same for mandatory arbitration clauses that take away the right of customers to seek redress in public courts.&#92;-- Ameriprise Financial Inc., Morgan Stanley and Principal Financial Group Inc: The brokers and insurers on the list have been zealous opponents of the fiduciary rule. Instead, they prefer a less stringent rule that allows them to sell products that are better for them than for their customers. Until those firms -- and Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan are in this group -- embrace a higher duty of care, their gestures toward stakeholders are hollow. Oh, and they should drop the requirement that customers agree to mandatory arbitration clauses as one of the conditions for opening a brokerage account.&#92;-- Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc.: For years these companies have been helping the American public achieve record levels of diabetes and obesity by selling health-damaging sugary drinks. They should acknowledge and warn customers of the consequences of consuming too much of their products, and accept the same kinds of taxes and health warnings now affixed to cigarettes.&#92;-- Deere & Co.: The maker of farm machinery has led the fight against customers, insisting that they not make repairs to the equipment they own, and denying them access to parts and instructions. Repairs can only be made by Deere service technicians in what has come to be known as a “repair monopoly.” Apple, by the way, does the same thing.&#92;-- Walmart Inc. and McDonald's Corp.: Both were steadfast opponents of increases in minimum wages for years. Although both now offer higher minimum pay, it was only after a tightening labor market forced them to increase wages. But this wasn't a case of corporate altruism -- their stores were messy and employees were sullen, and pay increases were part of plans to keep ill-treated customers from defecting. (McDonald's is not a signatory to the Roundtable memo).For the Roundtable commitment to be meaningful, the signatories are going to have to alter their behavior in ways large and small, and maybe even in ways that aren't always optimal for maximizing short-term profits. Still, we should be encouraged. But the proof will be in the follow through and the actual actions of the Roundtable members.(Corrects to clarify section on credit-card companies to indicate the role of banks in setting terms for customers.   )(1) In “The Shareholder Value Myth,” Lynn Stout explained how the entire theory is based on a misreading of a 1919 court case -- Dodge vs. Ford – at the time, both privately held, non-public companies.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In France, they call it taking mustard after dinner. In Germany, they talk about a child having already fallen in the well. In England, they speak of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.They all are good ways of describing how regulators have tended to deal with the world’s biggest tech firms. But when it comes to Facebook Inc.'s digital coin, Europe's antitrust watchdog seems to be intent on breaking with this previous inaction.Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the European Commission is scrutinizing the two-month-old Libra project and the group backing it amid concern the currency will be detrimental to competition. This is a good sign the regulator will do something about it.That’s welcome because antitrust authorities have, over the years, repeatedly failed to prevent the sort of practices which have cemented the dominance of Silicon Valley firms in their target markets. Regulators then struggle to rebalance the market after the fact.Some past decisions look misguided in hindsight. The most obvious are Google’s $3.2 billion acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008, which cemented the search giant’s control over digital ads, and Facebook’s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp – deals that made it the preeminent social network.Facebook’s plan should give regulators plenty of reasons for concern. The organization administering the digital currency, the Libra Association, comprises 28 members so far, but the extent of Facebook’s leading role warrants closer examination.QuicktakeWhy Everybody (Almost) Hates Facebook’s Digital CoinThe motivation for many of the members seems at this stage to be a fear of missing out. After all, Facebook’s 2.4 billion monthly active users give it unparalleled scale. But that could also be construed as the Menlo Park, California-based firm abusing a dominant position: Members of the association might feel they can’t risk being left out, so have little choice but to take part.The group includes most of the world’s biggest payments companies: Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc., Paypal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc, whose M-Pesa mobile money transfer service is dominant in parts of Africa.That means it could be seen as a horizontal agreement, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Aitor Ortiz. Those kind of arrangements may be acceptable in certain cases if they benefit the end user, but are normally anti-competitive if they consolidate the influence of a discrete group at the expense of consumers or rivals.Facebook has said that it won’t push ahead with Libra until it has secured all the necessary regulatory approvals. The European Commission’s message seems to be: Don’t push your luck. If the group fails to pay heed, it risks fines and punishments further down the line. That will make it harder to sign up new partners who are unwilling to expose themselves to such regulatory hazards.One has to wonder whether the growing regulatory scrutiny the currency is attracting will make the project worth the effort for Facebook. For sure, the social networking giant needs to find a way to diversify its revenue away from advertising. But I’m unconvinced that Libra does that.If anything, it will become another pillar of the advertising business by supplying valuable data on purchasing intent: every time you make a purchase using Facebook’s digital wallet, you give the company a better understanding of what you’re buying and why.All this highlights the contradiction at the heart of Libra: if it is truly independent, what’s in it for Facebook? Regulators are right to press for an answer.To contact the author of this story: Alex Webb at awebb25@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Edward Evans at eevans3@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Alex Webb is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe's technology, media and communications industries.

2019-08-22,"Over the past decade, Square (NYSE:SQ), the financial services and mobile-payments company, has been a fast-growth industry disruptor. From its humble beginnings when it offered a simple way for small vendors to accept credit cards, SQ has now become one of the biggest financial technology (fintech) companies in the world. And the SQ stock price since 2015 has reflected this growth.Source: Shutterstock However, Square stock is off its recent highs, as the shares got penalized following its second-quarter earnings report in August. The current economic and political environment in the U.S. and globally poses plenty of questions for market participants.And the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. If Square's revenue growth decelerates, then the price of SQ stock will also go down further. In the coming weeks, I'd be a buyer below $60, especially if it approaches $50.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's what investors should know before buying into SQ stock. How Square's Q2 Earnings CameSquare reported earnings on August 1 after market close. Notably, the payment-solutions company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues.  Its revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street's expectation of 17 cents per share.Square's subscription and services-based revenue also increased 87% to $251 million. This growth has been driven by its Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Deposit. Analysts were especially impressed with the Cash App whose quarterly revenue came at $135 million.The quarterly report once again confirmed that Square stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company's lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Square management projected higher-than-expected losses on the bottom line. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide.On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. Now the shares are hovering around $64. Square Is Not Yet ProfitableSquare was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). This innovative financial services company has expanded quickly, with its unique dongles for mobile phones that enable virtually everyone to accept credit-card payments.The global payments industry is a $100 trillion-plus market. While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has questions about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.Efforts to attain profitability are taking time. Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits. And unless it increases its revenue, Wall Street may take down the high valuation of SQ stock.For example, during the earnings release, Square announced the surprising sale of its Caviar foodservice platform to DoorDash. Some believe this exit is premature, considering the evenue potential. On the other hand, others believe that this sale enables Square to leave a low-margin business where competition is fierce.Square is now able to partner with DoorDash which has a much larger platform. In other words, it can further integrate its payment processing system to other foodservice platforms. Nonetheless, analysts agree that the surprise factor Caviar's sale has raised eyebrows.Finally, the expansion of Square's ecosystem also means that SQ will face increased competition. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction-processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global- payments giant. Technical Charts for SQ Stock Paint a Mixed PictureLet us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the years.Following the initial public offering of Square stock in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, shares have been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late-December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 15%, August has not been a good month for shares. That's of course due to the weak Q3 guidance.From a technical perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be rangebound between $60 and $70.Further, SQ stock has strong support between $60 and $65. However, if any negative headlines flash that affect the technology sector or the fintech sector specifically, then shares may easily go below $60.Plus, the daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect SQ to be choppy at best in the near-term.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing shares at this point. The Bottom Line on Square StockThe fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against SQ stock. In the short-term, though, stakeholders shouldn't expect smooth sailing.At the time of writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-23,"Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is the best retail stock besides Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The shares are up almost 22% in the last year, 82% over the last two years and 130% over the last five. It delivers a small, but steady dividend that has doubled over the last five years.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Costco's reputation as the best place to buy goods in bulk is reflected in its financial statements, where net income usually comes close to the amount it generates in membership fees. The stores are usually running at break-even.I have owned Costco shares, but sold them a few years ago, thinking they were overpriced. I worried that Costco was running out of places to grow, as young people moved into small city apartments the company doesn't serve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI was wrong. So far in 2019 Costco shareholders have done better than those at Walmart (NYSE:WMT) or even Amazon. Communist? Or Conservative?Costco is unique among retailers not just in that it pays its line employees well, but in that it doesn't overpay managers. Employees are thus more satisfied with their pay and working conditions at Costco than employees at any other company -- even those at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).But Costco is also conservative, in the best possible way. It can cost as much as $100 million to outfit a new store, so it usually rolls out just one or two each month. Its stores are all located in upper-middle class suburbs, with ample parking, gas stations and tire centers. It is the last great suburban success story. Unlike Walmart, it doesn't suck up the whole retail market, it just skims the cream off its top.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip Costco has no secrets. Management admits its focus is on customers and employees, not just shareholders. Its stock is limited to a few items in each category, and its markups average just 15%, against 25-50% markups from other retailers. The company's Kirkland store brand often offers better quality than the national brands it competes with. Costco was late to online shopping, but its app is already considered better than that of Walmart's Sam's Club.During the era of President Donald Trump, which has benefitted upper-income suburbanites most, Costco's growth has accelerated. Sales for the first three quarters of 2019 are up 6.5% overall, and online sales are up almost 25%. During the current fiscal year, it has paid back over one-quarter of its long-term debt, nearly $1.7 billion, despite super-low interest rates.  Can Costco Stock Continue?There are indications that finally, Costco is running out of growth. Neighborhoods and local governments are fighting new stores in some wealthy neighborhoods.Costco's profits accelerated after it switched from using an American Express (NYSE:AXP) to a Citicorp (NYSE:C) by Visa (NYSE:V) card, as did benefits to cardholders. But that's a trick that is hard to repeat.Costco is growing internationally and opened its first store in Shanghai this month. Currently 68% of its stores are in the U.S., but that will change as it rolls out executive memberships in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.Costco's growth has been decelerating slowly in 2019, into the mid-single digits each month, as its fiscal 2018 revenue came to $141 billion. The Bottom Line on COST StockCostco stock is an investment, not a trade. Costco is managed conservatively for the long run. Even if the stores look cookie-cutter, they don't open until after years of careful planning. Risks are growing. A higher international profile means there are now currency risks, trade risks and social dislocation risks. Even Walmart has had its misadventures in growing globally.But, as I said at the outset, I was a fool to sell my shares. Hang on to yours.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-26,"Just two months ago, with a great deal of hype and fanfare, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg unveiled his company’s latest project: the Libra Association, a blockchain cryptocurrency initiative backed by a variety of well-heeled corporations – including Facebook (FB), private venture capital firms, and major players in payment processing, such as Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and PayPal (PYPL) – and linked to a basket of traditional fiat currencies as a hedge against the extreme volatility of the “pure” cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Facebook being involved, the controversy did not take long to erupt.The main concerns, at first, centered around user privacy issues. Facebook has a notoriously poor reputation in this area, and went to great lengths to address possible concerns. The new Libra crypto coin will be administered by the Libra Association, not by Facebook directly. The Association is grouping of Libra’s backers, each of which gets an equal voice in overseeing the currency. The Libra Association members each put the same $10 million investment into the common pot backing the currency, so no one member can claim a larger share than the others. On paper, it’s appears to be a good system. The Governments Get into the GameIt didn’t take long for government watchdogs to start sniffing around Libra project. As early as June 18, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire spoke against Libra, saying “Libra must not become a sovereign currency.” In the EU Parliament, a German member agreed, and added that Facebook and other private companies cannot be allowed “to operate in a regulatory nirvana when introducing virtual currencies. A month later, the US House of Representatives had David Marcus, Facebook’s head of cyrpotcurrency, before the Financial Services Committee. During the testimony, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) said, “The creation of a new currency is a core government function and should be left to democratically accountable institutions, that are accountable to the American people.” She added that if Facebook does go through with the Libra launch next year, it should start with a small pilot program under SEC and Federal Reserve supervision.Now the European Commission is starting to investigate Libra. In a circular sent out to the 28 members of the Libra Association last week, the antitrust regulators said, “The Commission is in particular concerned about the possible competition restrictions that may result from the Association, especially with regard to information that will be exchanged and the use of consumer data.” The questionnaire requests follow-up within two to three weeks.The new regulatory interest from the EU may have spooked some members of the Libra Association; anonymous reports are circulating that at least three of Libra’s original backers have discussed leaving the group. The reports add that the nervous investors are expressing concern over the effect that regulatory probes into Libra will have on their core businesses. A Careful LaunchFor its part, Facebook – and its partners – are approaching the Libra project with caution. David Marcus has already said that the new crypto coin will undergo “the most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight in financial tech history.” Libra won’t launch until the middle of next year, and while a charter is not yet public, Marcus’ statement makes clear that Libra’s rules are being drawn up in the sure knowledge that they will face close regulatory scrutiny.That’s the background, and the current state of Facebook’s Libra project. So far, indications are that the blockchain project is going ahead; the regulatory interest has the backers cautious, but none have yet dropped out. So, let’s take a closer look at some of those backers, and their stock performance.  Facebook, Inc. (FB)The main issue with Facebook, as it has been for a long time, is user privacy. The company’s reputation in this area is justly poor. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to the exposure of users’ private photos, 2018 was the year of data breaches for the social media giant. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg publicly admitted Facebook’s failings in privacy protection. Just two weeks later, added insult to irony, the company disclosed that up to 600 million user passwords, across its apps, had been stored in plaintext. This past spring, Facebook was hit by the Federal Trade Commission with a record-setting $5 billion fine in response to the privacy problems.Starting in July of last year, the predictable happened and Facebook’s stock started losing heavily. It bottomed out on December 24 and has since regained its losses, and then some. In the past month, FB shares have slipped 13%. With all of that, the company remains popular with top analysts.SunTrust’s 5-star analyst Youssef Squali, in an August 20 note, agreed that FB has upbeat prospects. Noting that the company has a long way to go on privacy protection – he wrote, “We note that the data is not deleted and remains on FB’s servers for a length of time that’s unclear to us. This means the data could still be used to report back to an advertiser if a user has purchased a product after viewing the ad, which appears to fall somewhat short of the original pledge by CEO Zuckerberg of empowering users to flush their history whenever they want…” – Squali still set a price target of $236, suggesting an upside of 32%.Overall, Facebook has a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 33 buy ratings and 3 holds given in the past three months. FB shares are trading for $177, and the $234 average price target indicates a 32% upside. Mastercard, Inc. (MA)Mastercard is an original member of the Libra Association, and in addition to the membership fee, it brings its payment processing network and long experience in the financial industry. In all of the recent regulatory dust-up around Libra, Mastercard’s only official statement was not to comment on the matter. Fortunately for customers, Mastercard has a far better reputation than Facebook when it comes to data protection.As an investment, MA has offered excellent returns for a long time. The stock is up 44% year-to-date, more than triple the S&P 500’s gain. The stock’s dividend is reliable, and while only yielding 0.49%, the stock’s high trading value makes the annual payout $1.32 per share.Underscoring MA’s inherent value to investors, Nomura analyst Bill Carache said after the company’s recent quarterly report, “Another solid quarter, fueled by better than expected volume growth, new partnership signings, and progress across its growth initiatives. We believe the company can continue to generate mid-teens compound annual earnings growth.” In line with this, he set a Buy rating on the stock and raised his price target by 15%, to $324. His new PT suggests a 19% upside.Mastercard also holds a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock has received 14 buy ratings a single hold in the last 90 days. Shares are selling for $271, so the $309 average price target implies 13% upside potential. Visa, Inc. (V)The larger of the two major credit card issuers and payment processers, Visa is very similar to Mastercard as an investment. The company is solid, having shown steady returns over an extended timeframe. It offers a low-yield dividend of 0.57%, but the share price boosts the dividend payment to a full $1 annualized. Visa’s fiscal Q3 results beat the forecasts last month, and suggest that the company will just keep chugging along with steady low- to mid-teens growth rates. Like Mastercard, Visa has not commented on the regulatory agencies’ interest in Libra.Nomura’s Bill Careche is as upbeat on Visa as he was on Mastercard. He says Visa is “…uniquely positioned to sustain mid-teens annual earnings growth against an uncertain macro backdrop.” Careche’s $204 target on V implies an upside of 16%.Visa’s analyst consensus rating is another Strong Buy, this one based on 18 buys and 1 hold. With shares selling at $175, and an average price target of $201, the stock has an upside potential of 15%. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL)The last stock we are looking at here is the leader in the online payment processing space. PayPal has been operating independently since 2015, and has shown consistent stock gains since then. Shares are up 26% year-to-date, despite a slip at the end of July.PayPal’s involvement in Libra makes eminent sense. The company’s proven expertise in payment processing and online finance are highly relevant to the Libra Association, and unlike Facebook, PayPal has not been plagued by data privacy issues. And like Mastercard and Visa, PayPal is a high-quality investment-grade stock.Kenneth Hill, from Rosenblatt Securities, would agree. He initiated coverage with a Buy rating and said, “Look past the recent tumble in PayPal Holdings stock, and the longer-term outlook for the firm looks as healthy as ever.” PayPal’s Strong Buy consensus rating is a measure of that long-term health. The stock has 18 buys and 2 holds given in the past three months, and a share price of $106. The average price target of $130 suggests a robust upside of 22%.Visit TipRanks’ Trending Stocks page to find out what investments are hot with Wall Street’s top analysts.",Will Facebook Libra Survive Regulatory Scrutiny?

2019-08-28,"Wednesday was an interesting day of market action. Stocks rallied even as some market observers said investors may be overlooking mounting signs of a looming recession.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com On a related note, new Quinnipiac Poll showed 37% of those surveyed believe the U.S. economy is declining while just 31% see it getting better. Should those numbers worsen in the coming months, it's likely a death knell for President Donald Trump's 2020 reelection bid because the economy has long been the issue he has polled favorably on.Adding to those concerns was a separate poll of would-be homebuyers that indicates more than a third are expecting a recession to arrive in 2020. Reading the tea leaves here, it would be reasonable to assume that, like him or not, President Trump is shrewd enough to realize that the trade war with China is seen as crimping the economy. He cannot carry that baggage into 2020 and hope to be reelected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Even with those ominous headlines, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.38% while the S&P 500 added 0.65%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1%. Victorious VisaI mention Visa (NYSE:V) today not because the stock finished higher (it didn't) and not because it is one of the Dow's best-performing names this year (it is), but rather because the often-overlooked Dow component was on the receiving end of some bullish analyst commentary today, indicating it could add to its 35.2% year-to-date gain.&quot;We've come away from the meeting with greater conviction that V's 'network of networks' strategy is significantly expanding the company's opportunity set--and as a consequence, we see V continuing to generate strong volume growth,&quot; said Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell in a recent note.The analyst has a $199 price target on Visa shares. Oil Bucks Bad NewsExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the Dow's two energy components, traded higher today, which was something of a surprise when considering some gloomy commentary about oil prices out from Morgan Stanley this morning.&quot;More cuts would be required in 2020 if [OPEC] were to balance the market,&quot; said Morgan Stanley analysts. &quot;Much depends on demand growth next year, but on our current estimates the 'call on OPEC' is about 1M bbl/day below current production in 2020.&quot;Rather, Chevron and Exxon were propped up by a bullish inventories report, showing a larger-than-expected decline. Last week, domestic oil inventories declined by 10 million barrels, more than double the expected 4.7 million-barrel drop, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Nike Sizing Up New HighsNike (NYSE:NKE) is a stock I've mentioned plenty in this space because of its tariff sensitivity, which explains a dismal August performance for the stock, but the shares surged 1.78% today. The stock resides just 7% below its 52-week high, though, and some traders are talking about a swift return to record highs for the athletic apparel maker. So if you're looking for a large-cap growth name for your portfolio, Nike is viable name to consider over the near-term. A Defensive DynamoIt's hard to ignore the stocks that have been trading high in a rough August for the broader market. One of those names is Dow component Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Sure, the stock is up &quot;just&quot; 1.35% this month, but that's pretty good for a slow-moving consumer staples name, and really good when considering broader benchmarks have been thrashed.The stock is healthy, fundamentally and technically speaking, prompting some traders to call more new highs over the near-term. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt's hard to reconcile all the gloomy chatter about the economy with today's equity market upside, but the path of least resistance for this school of thought is that if more signs of weakness emerge for the U.S. economy, President Trump will &quot;cool it&quot; on the trade front and the Federal Reserve will react swiftly with more rate cuts.For the rest of this week, I wouldn't bank on much action, save for President Trump getting active on Twitter, because the Labor Day holiday is looming. We could see some modest selling Thursday and Friday as traders look to dial back risk ahead of the long weekend.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-28,"Since late July, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has been in a funk. Consider that shares have dropped from $82 to $63 in less than 30 days. In fact, for the past 12 months, the return is a miserable loss of 20%.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com This is certainly in stark contrast to 2016 to late 2018, when SQ stock was mostly in the bull phase. Interestingly enough, mature operators like Visa (NYSE:V) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have done much better during the past year.Now the recent drop could easily be temporary. After all, Square remains a top player in the lucrative fintech category, which is a $100-plus trillion market opportunity.  So yes, there is lots of room for plenty of players.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSQ has also been adept at expanding on its core payments platform. The company has expanded into areas like payroll, gift cards, loyalty programs, marketing services, e-commerce, business loans and so on. More importantly, Square has been effective in monetizing these services. During the latest quarter, subscription and service revenues spiked by 87% to $251 million.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow All great, right? Yes, this is true. But I still think investors should be cautious. There are actually some nagging issues that could easily weigh on SQ stock. The Problems with Square StockTake a look at the Cash App. On the face of it, it looks like a solid business, with revenues of $260 million in the quarter. But if you look deeper, you'll notice that a hefty $135 million came from bitcoin activities.No doubt, this segment can be highly volatile. It's not uncommon to see major swings in the value of bitcoin. So, if there is another drop, it could make it tough for SQ to hit its growth targets.In the meantime, the competition in the fintech market is getting more intense. Venture capitalists continue to pour billions into fast-growing startups, presenting potential challenges to Square stock.But there has also been innovation from traditional players like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BB&T (NYSE:BBT), Capital One (NYSE:COF), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), PNC Bank (NYSE:PNC), US Bank (NYSE:USB) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).Keep in mind that these companies are the backers of Zelle, which is a successful person-to-person payments app. It has certainly benefited from the substantial financial resources, technical talent and vast distribution.Yet I think the biggest risk factor for SQ stock is a potential recession. Granted, the U.S. economy has proven to be resilient. But there are more and more ominous signs. These include the fall off in real estate and manufacturing as well as the inversion of the yield curve.If a recession hits - or there is a notable slowdown - the impact on Square stock could be particularly severe. The company's main user base is small businesses, which are the most vulnerable.Square even included this in its 10-K:Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. Bottom Line on SQ StockEven with the fall in SQ stock, the valuation is far from cheap. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is about 56 times.True, the growth rate has continued to be strong. During the second quarter, revenue spiked by 46% to $563 million.But again, this growth could easily decelerate if the economy stumbles. If anything, the latest fall in SQ stock is an indication of how sensitive Wall Street is. So even a small change could have an adverse impact.So for now, it's probably better to hold off and wait for a better valuation.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-08-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is in talks to make an investment in Indonesian ride-hailing giant Gojek, people familiar with the negotiations said, a move that could bolster the U.S. company’s presence in Southeast Asia.Amazon is one of the firms that have been negotiating with Gojek to join its ongoing funding round, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. Under one scenario that has been considered, Amazon may make a meaningful investment for a slice of Indonesia’s most valuable startup, said one of the people. The talks may still fall apart or the terms may change.A Gojek representative declined to comment. Amazon couldn’t immediately be reached for comment outside of normal business hours. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the discussions.The move could mark Amazon’s most significant investment in Indonesia, one of the last frontiers of e-commerce. The Seattle-based retail giant took its first step into the region in 2017 when it entered Singapore with Amazon Prime Now. But in Indonesia, by far the region’s biggest and most promising market with 260 million people, it has no presence.By contrast, Chinese tech titans have made inroads into the region recently. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. spent billions of dollars to acquire online shopping company Lazada Group and invested in homegrown Indonesian e-commerce companies Tokopedia PT and Bukalapak. Tencent Holdings Ltd. has backed Sea Ltd., whose mobile shopping unit Shopee is battling fiercely with Lazada.Gojek debuted its app for hailing motorbike taxis in Jakarta in 2015. Since then, the company has evolved into a “super app” -- part ride-sharing service, part food-delivery business and part digital-wallet provider. It also offers a dozen other on-demand services such as booking a cleaner and medicine delivery.As part of the ongoing Series F funding round, Gojek -- valued at $10 billion, according to CB Insights -- has secured investments from Visa Inc., Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank Plc, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Co. this year.

The company is still set in an exciting area of business. The financial technology stocks like this have a long-term rising demand curve. The whole world is in a trend to migrate all financial transactions to digital. This movement gained steam from the popularity of Bitcoin and its blockchain technology.Since we know that the SQ products and services will remain in demand for years, it's safe to assume that Square stock should also do well. Only management flubs or a market-wide crashes could changed that in the short to mid term. SQ Stock Has Upside OpportunitySquare stock still has technical opportunities and pitfalls to help guide the timing down here. If SQ falls below $60.50 per share it could trigger a bearish pattern worth another $6 decrease from there. While this is not a forecast it's a realistic scenario that is just below current levels. If that happens then it would make the argument much stronger to go long SQ.Conversely, if the bulls can break above $67 per share they could launch a rally to fill the gap to $69 but also the bigger one all the way to $78. Clearly there are several resistance levels along the way starting at $65. Each of them are milestones for the bulls.So far, SQ has been shy about taking advantage of breakout setups. It had at least two great positions this year but they both failed in a big way. The earnings reactions in March and August were perfect setups for a major breakout but alas for the bulls the investors reacted negatively to what management delivered.So the concern here for SQ stock is stabilization first then worry about rallies. Buying the dip of it has worked better than trying to time a spike. So at the first sign of the S&P stabilizing, SQ would make for a good bounce trade off the lows and exit at the breakout line until this pattern breaks.Fundamentally, SQ stock is not cheap as it still loses money and sells at 8 times sales. Since it is a growth stock, Wall Street allows it a lot of slack on the profitability line. So this for now is okay as long as management doesn't disappoint on sales forecasts.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income In short, fintech stocks are going to thrive for years to come so this bodes well for SQ stock. So in spite of the geopolitical distractions here, demand for SQ services will persist.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-29,Visa Inc. today announced its participation in the following investor conferences.,Visa Inc. to Participate in Upcoming Investor Conferences
2019-08-29,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges said it has learned a valuable lesson from the push back on Facebook Inc.’s Libra and will take a different approach as it works on a rival project.Malta-based crypto platform Binance is ready to engage with all regulators from day one as it prepares to roll out its Venus digital currencies. “If we want to launch Venus in a country, we’ll make sure it complies with the regulations,” the exchange’s co-founder He Yi said in an interview.Binance announced last week it plans to seek partners to create so-called stable coins -- digital currencies that are pegged to traditional money and thus less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which fluctuate based on market dynamics. In an interview detailing the project, He said Venus drew inspiration from Facebook’s Libra in many ways -- but that the resistance from governments around the world to the social-media behemoth’s plan served as a cautionary tale.Facebook hopes its new currency will be used for everyday transactions across the globe after it goes live as soon as next year under the governance of a broad set of partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. and Spotify Technology SA. But since the release of its whitepaper in June, Libra has drawn wide-ranging regulatory scrutiny. The European Union has started an antitrust investigation, U.S. officials from President Donald Trump to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have questioned Libra and officials from places like India have expressed skepticism.READ: EU Antitrust Probe Is Facebook-Led Libra’s Latest HeadacheBinance also plans to form an independent association in charge of Venus, and use a basket of government-backed currencies and securities as its reserve. But He said the company will take a “more conservative” approach to push through the project, with a priority on regulatory compliance rather than technological developments.Unlike Libra, Venus will focus on partnering with governments and companies in non-Western countries, He said. In a special shout-out to China, she called Venus a “Belt and Road version of Libra,” saying its geographic scope would roughly align with Beijing’s sprawling infrastructure initiative.The emphasis on regulatory buy-in is yet another sign of Binance’s efforts to improve its relationship with governments. The crypto platform, established in 2017, has at times played a game of regulatory whac-a-mole -- for example, it quit markets including Japan and China to avoid clashes with local financial watchdogs. But more recently Binance has set up regulatory-compliant exchanges in friendlier jurisdictions like Singapore and Malta, allowing customers to trade using real money.China, meanwhile, is planning to release its own cryptocurrency that would eventually replace cash in circulation and give Beijing even more control of its financial system. The country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has already shut down local crypto exchanges.“So far regulators around the world can’t gauge precisely the potential risks stable coins will bring to their financial systems, and that’s why they are very careful about Libra-like currencies,” said Hu Tao, founder of Beijing-based crytpo researcher TokenInsight. “In theory, Binance will face the same challenges as Facebook.”In the Chinese statement announcing Venus, Binance advises governments to launch a regulatory sandbox, which, among other things, allows private firms to issue their own stable coins for payments and cross-border settlements. “It’s better to embrace the change rather than missing the opportunity,” according to the statement written by He.Binance will likely create a new open-sourced blockchain for Venus, He says, rather than using its own Binance Chain, which already supports a range of stable coins. The exchange operator is willing to give up some commercial interests to attract more partners, she said, although the plan hasn’t been finalized yet.He is leading a team of more than 10 people in compliance, business development and coding to work on the Venus project. There’s no time line yet for the launch, but she expects more details including partnerships to be released in the next few months.A TV anchor-turned tech entrepreneur, He launched Binance with “CZ” Zhao Changpeng after leaving Chinese crypto exchange OKCoin, which the two co-founded. Previously she also served as a vice-president of marketing for Beijing-based Yixia Technology, which owns a slew of popular short video apps.To contact the reporter on this story: Zheping Huang in Hong Kong at zhuang245@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Joanna Ossinger, Colum MurphyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Crypto Exchange Says It’ll Handle Regulators Better Than Libra
2019-08-29,"Volatility is here to stay. There's no doubt about it. Thanks to Trump's continued tweeting and flip-flopping about the trade war, dwindling economic data and overall general malaise, the market is starting to see some big swings as investors try and digest the environment. And with the yield curve inverting, many analysts are predicting a recession could be in our future. All in all, it's making for many sleepless nights.But it doesn't have to be. Not if you use exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to bolster your portfolio.One of the great things about ETFs is that they allow investors to tap a variety of asset classes and strategies. That includes a hefty amount of portfolio hedging. By buying certain ETFs, you can instantly knock down the risk portfolio of your portfolio, add non-correlated assets and ride out the storm. More importantly, using certain ETFs you can finally have a good night's sleep in the face of all this market volatility.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up With the current environment only getting worse, it makes sense to find ways to lower your risk and these three ETFs to buy will do just that. iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV)Some stocks just &quot;move&quot; less than others and one of the best ways to fight volatility is to bet on those that do. But combing through the thousands of individual names to find those that offer lower volatility can be a very difficult task. That's where ETFs can come in handy and the iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (NYSEARCA:USMV) makes quick work of the chore.The $32 billion ETF is the largest fund in the low-vol category and for good reason. As a so-called smart-beta ETF, USMV uses various screens to kick out high-volatility stocks in order to capture the upside of the market and at the same time eliminate the downside. The idea is that betting on stocks like Visa (NYSE:V) and garbage company Republic Services (NYSE:RPG) that have historically shown lower overall volatility will result in a smoother ride for portfolios. You still get most of the market's gains but limit the losses.And so far, USMV has delivered on that promise. Since its inception, USMV has managed to capture 81% of the broader market's gains, but only realized 54% of its declines. For example, during the recent swoon in December of last year, the ETF only lost 7.1% vs a more than 9% loss for the S&P 500. By using USMV, investors can still stay invested and reduce their risk. In this environment, that's very important.The best part is that the ETF is dirt cheap to own. As part of iShares' core line-up, USMV charges just 0.15%, or $15 annually per $10,000 invested.All in all, for those looking for equity exposure, USMV is one of the best ETFs to buy to ride out the volatility. SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL)Let's call a spade, a spade. We've had nearly a decade of economic expansion and stock market gains. There's a good chance that your portfolio is also much higher even with the recent volatility and lower returns. With that, there's no harm in taking some gains off the table and moving some money to cash. You won't return a lot, but sometimes getting a return of principal is better than a return on price. And ETFs can help on this front as well.A prime example is the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (NYSEARCA:BIL).The $9 billion ETF tracks ultra-short U.S. treasury bonds and spreads its assets among 15 holdings. Those bonds that mature every one to three months give the ETF a duration of just 32 days. This is important as it allows the ETF to roll over its holdings faster and it is basically immune from rising and falling rates.Moreover, this ultra-short nature provides it with a very steady share price. This gives it cash-like properties and allows it to be a great place to hide-out when the market gets stormy. In fact, as an ETF, BIL has become a preferred choice for many institutional investors looking to quickly move into cash when the volatility hits.  * 7 'Strong Buy' Stocks to Beat Volatility Returns for BIL have been low over its history. But that's kind of the point. It's designed to be the ballast for your riskier holdings and on that front, the ETF succeeds. With a low expense ratio of just 0.13%, BIL makes a great cash-alternative for the current volatile environment. Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF (SGOL)In times of duress, nothing glitters like gold. And right now, the precious metal is shining bright. Prices for gold have surged to near six-year highs as the market has gotten wonky and volatility has risen. To that end, hedging a portion of your assets with the non-correlated nature of gold could make a ton of sense. The best part is that ETFs make owning gold easy and eliminates many of the headaches about buying physical gold bars and coins.The Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:SGOL) is just one of the many ETFs that provide access.SGOL is what's known as a physically backed exchange-traded fund. That is, each share is backed by one-tenth of an ounce stored on behalf of investors in a vault. The twist for the Aberdeen fund is that the gold is stored in a vault in Switzerland, which, given its neutrality from foreign affairs, is supposedly safer. The real beauty for investors is that this ETF makes owning the precious metal beyond simple. Buy ten shares and you have one ounce of the precious metal in your portfolio. It really is that easy.The best part for investors is that since investment manager Aberdeen has taken over the ETF, expenses for the fund have shrunk considerably. Costing just 0.17% in expenses, SGOL is now cheaper than other gold ETFs like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA:GLD) ETF. That makes it a prime portfolio consideration for these times.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-29,"With August's trading winding down, we're heading into a month that's known to be problematic. The average September return for the S&P 500 is a loss of 0.62%, and it's down more often than it is up. And this year, we're heading into the month still overbought from the big bounceback from early in the year.It's a dangerous time to be taking on new long positions, but that danger doesn't necessarily apply across the board. There are a handful of stocks well-positioned to rally through what could be a bearish backdrop.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week To that end, here's a rundown of the top stocks to buy for September, and perhaps beyond. In some cases these names are coming out of a prolonged lull, while others are seemingly stuck in unstoppable uptrends. In all cases though, the odds of standout strength are at least a little better than average. In no particular order …InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Activision Blizzard (ATVI)The final quarter of last year was a miserable one for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), and its shareholders. Shares fell a total of 52% from peak to trough, as a couple of different missteps and missed opportunities took a toll. Namely, it didn't see &quot;Fortnite&quot; coming, and its &quot;Black Ops 4&quot; title wasn't as well-received as hoped.The meltdown served as something of a wake up call for the company. While there's still work to be done, the game publisher at least knows what's left to do.ATVI stock has also started to grind its way out of a hole, logging a string of higher lows since February's bottom, and working its way back above the important 200-day moving average line. On the verge of punching through resistance at $51.60, the pace of the rebound could perk up very soon. Visa (V)It's an unusually persistent gainer. Granted, the gains aren't necessarily red-hot and take a while to put in place. The rally also isn't without its occasional flaws and stumbles. By and large, any setbacks Visa (NYSE:V) suffers are shallow and short-lived, and there's a lot to be said for consistency. V stock is up nearly 130% since the end of 2016 thanks to its steady march forward.Now is a compelling time to step in too, after a small stumble that pulled Visa shares back from its early August high near $184 to a low of $167. All it took was a kiss of the 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray, to renew the rally. That may be all the dip we're going to get.  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income It's not a cheap stock, valued at 34 times its trailing earnings and more than 28 times next year's projected profit. A frothy valuation hasn't held Visa shares back at any point in its past though. Scorpio Tankers (STNG)Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) shares rolled over in 2015, and never looked back … until April of this year, when something clearly changed. STNG stock broke out of a long-standing and well-established rut. The company reported its first quarterly profit since 2016. Despite all the trade war noise and inconsistent pricing of crude oil, shipping rates improved enough to let the company book net earnings of 30 cents per share. That was more than twice what analysts were expecting.The enthusiasm that re-ignited STNG stock in April has since cooled. Take a closer look at the chart, however, and you'll see the 200-day moving average line, in white, is trying to renew the recovery effort.It's still one of the top stocks to buy for that reason, not to mention the shipping rates that improved enough to drive a swing to a profit are improving again after a summer lull. Darden Restaurants (DRI)The restaurant business isn't usually a highly profitable one. It's also an industry that's particularly vulnerable to recessions. But, Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) is a proven operator. Assuming the chatter about a global economic headwind is more bark than bite, Darden's business will be fine.To that end, analysts are calling for more than 6% worth of sales growth this year, which should drive profits from last year's $5.82 per share to $6.40, and then on to $6.86 per share next year.  * 10 Companies Using AI to Grow Arguably the biggest reason DRI stock has earned a spot on a short list of stocks to buy headed into September, however, is its reliable forward progress. It's hardly a straight line, but this is a name that has rewarded buyers who've stepped in on the dips like the one we're in the midst of making. NiSource (NI)It's not a fast mover, but what NiSource (NYSE:NI) lacks in speed it makes up for in reliability. Shares of the utility name are up more than 50% since the end of 2016, and investors didn't have to experience any seasickness to reap that reward.That being said, this chart started to take on a curious shape earlier this year, when it broke above the upper boundary of a converging wedge pattern, framed in blue, that had been guiding it upward since late-2015. Rather than peel back from it, NiSource shares have fought their way above it, using support found at the gray 100-day moving average line.It's got a lot to do with falling interest rates. But, inasmuch as rates are apt to remain suppressed for the foreseeable future on top of NiSource's history of steadily increasing payouts, NI stock could be a nice, safe place to tuck away some capital while the broad market gets its bearings. Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (KTOS)Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ:KTOS) is anything but a household name. With a modest market cap of only $2.1 billion, odds are good most investors have never even heard of it.Don't let its obscurity fool you though. This little defense contractor is getting real big, real fast. Revenue is projected to grow 18% this year, and then do the same in 2020, driving the bottom line from last year's 24 cents per share to 32 cents this year to a whopping 49 cents per share next year.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale The market appreciated this growth pace -- in spades -- in May of this year, but perhaps too much. That big rally set the stage for a wave of profit-taking. The selloff stopped and started to reverse once the 200-day moving average line was met last week though, making now a compelling time to step in. Old Republic International (ORI)If the name Old Republic International (NYSE:ORI) rings a bell but you can't quite remember why, think insurance. The company operates several different insurance businesses, some of which use the moniker, while others don't. Old Republic is also the parent of outfits like Great West Casualty Company and BITCO.For a variety of reasons ranging from interest rate turbulence to an inordinate number of devastating hurricanes, to the growing unpredictability of lifespans, the insurance industry has been an increasingly tough one to manage. Old Republic has made it look easy, consistently driving revenue growth while driving less consistent income growth for a decade now. Twelve-month revenue of $6.6 billion is markedly better than the twelve-month revenue tally of $5.5 billion from five years ago.That's a key part of the reason the stock has managed to make reliable, even if choppy, forward progress. It's an especially interesting prospect right now, as ORI stock is still closer to the bottom of its rising trading range than the top of it. Graphic Packaging Holding (GPK)Graphic Packaging Holding (NYSE:GPK) has taken shareholders on a roller coaster ride over the course of the past five years, from a high above $16 to a low below $10, yet is currently priced where it was as of late-2014.The market may have been unduly doubtful of Graphic Packaging's potential, particularly of late. This year's expected revenue growth of just under 3% isn't jaw-dropping, and next year's modeled 2.4% improvement is even less thrilling. Modest sales are driving less-modest earnings growth, however, of 6% this year and 15% in 2020, according to analysts.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More To that end, analysts believe investors are collectively undervaluing GPK stock. They rated it a little better than a &quot;Buy,&quot; and hold a consensus target price of $16.70, versus its current price of $13.40. Incyte (INCY)Like most biopharmaceutical stocks, Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) is no stranger to wide, prolonged swings. Shares rallied from around $65 in early 2016 to a high of $149 by early 2017, back to a low of around $58 late last year.If you can catch one of the stock's turning points though, it can lead to a big payoff. It looks like the stock's trying to make good on the bullish pivot that materialized in December. Though that bounce cooled in April and has since done nothing, a closer look makes clear that INCY stock is finding persistent support at its rising 200-day moving average line, plotted in white.There's still a key technical ceiling around $89, where Incyte shares peaked a couple of times this year. But, with double-digit sales growth expected this year and next thanks to strong interest in its relatively young cancer drug Jakafi, the odds of a breakout are a little too good to ignore. TE Connectivity (TEL)Finally, add TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL) to your list of prospective stocks to buy before we get too deep into September.Like Kratos, TE Connectivity isn't exactly a household name, for a couple of reasons. Chief among them is the fact that it's based in Switzerland. The other is that it makes electronics components most people don't give a second thought to. Wires, heat shrink tubing, and cable connectors are all part of its portfolio. RF antennas would be considered the high-tech portion of its product menu.What it lacks in pizzazz, however, it makes up for in reliability. The advent of 5G wouldn't be taking shape without the simple pieces and parts TE Connectivity provides, but there's always some sort of electronics evolution that keeps TE Connectivity moving forward.One has to zoom way out to see it, but the push up and off of a long-term support line going back to 2009 has set the stage for a multi-year advance that has only just begun.As of this writing, James Brumley held long positions in NiSource and Activision Blizzard.

2019-08-29,"Shares of CSX (NYSE:CSX) aren't looking good. The stock has been in decline as economic and trade-related worries continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Recent quarterly results aren't helping matters and all said, CSX stock is now down 20% from its highs.Source: Shutterstock Is it enough to draw in investors, or is the start of a nasty bear market in this rail stock?If the charts are any indication, more pain may be on the way. There is some hope left for bulls, if support can buoy the name. Or if we get some positive fundamentals news for the stock. But as it stands, the technicals are struggling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLet's look at a few charts and see where CSX stock could be heading. Trading CSX Stock  Click to EnlargeThere is a daily chart to the side and a below that is a weekly chart. Both highlight the not-so-hot setup of CSX stock price right now.As you can see on the daily chart, CSX stock has a very bearish-looking setup. After declining precipitously from $80 in mid-July, shares continue to put in a series of lower highs. That's squeezing CSX against a static level of support near $64. Should support give way, the stock will start probing the 2019 lows.CSX stock is already below all of its major moving averages and Fibonacci retracements. The 20-day is below the 50-day moving average, and the 50-day is crossing below the 200-day. This indicates that both short- and long-term momentum is turning in the bears' favor.For bulls to have a shot, they first need $63 to $64 to prove itself as support. From there, they need to get CSX over downtrend resistance (blue line) and the 20-day moving average. If they can muster up the strength for that, clearing the 61.8% retracement near $67 is next on the list.Should support fail, the year-to-date lows near $60 are the first target. Below that and the 52-week lows near $58 are next.  Click to EnlargeOn the longer term chart, investors can see that CSX is teetering on its 200-week moving average. While the action hasn't been decisive, shares are actually below this mark now. This key moving average drew in buyers last December, halting CSX's decline and kickstarting a multi-month rally.The same momentum has not been seen this time around. Furthermore, long-term uptrend support (blue line) is being leaned on as well. If these levels give way, a decline to $58 is surely possible.On both charts, a rebound over $71 would be most encouraging for the bulls. Valuing CSX StockAn escalating trade war and worries about a recession do not help companies like CSX Corp. What does help CSX, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and other rail companies is a strong consumer.Thankfully, that's exactly what we have. With a strong labor market and consumers who are willing to spend -- as noted by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Visa (NYSE:V) and others -- demand for products remains high. Should that change, then the rails could be in trouble.Some of that fear is getting priced into the stock as we speak. With an inverting yield curve and manic headlines driving the news each day, how can investors not start to price in that possibility?Of course, it doesn't help when CSX stock fails to deliver as well. In July, the company missed on second-quarter expectations. Revenue of $3.06 billion missed estimates by more than $80 million and contracted 1.3% year-over-year. Earnings of $1.08 per share missed consensus estimates by 3 cents a share. Making matters worse, management cut its full-year revenue outlook.This came after five straight earnings and revenue beats. In Q1, CSX beat earnings estimates by more than 10% and grew revenue 4.75% year-over-year. To say Q2 was disappointing is an understatement.With additional tariffs looming, we may see some &quot;pull ahead&quot; from buyers in the current quarter. Further, we're coming up to Q3 and Q4, which are typically heavy demand months for consumers. If that's enough to improve the fundamentals for CSX stock, we'll need to it reflected on the charts.Over $67 give the bulls some spark. Over $71 and momentum can really pick up.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Kenwell is long V.

2019-09-03,"The internet of things has been a hot topic for years now, but with a 5G revolution right around the corner, connected devices are garnering more and more attention. Trade tension with China has made the market shaky, especially in the tech space. However, when it comes to picking stocks to buy in the technology sector, the internet of things is a great place to start.Here's a look at five stocks that offer exposure to the fast-growing internet of things market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Internet of Things Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com If you're looking for internet of things stocks to buy, the first place to look is network providers. None of the connectivity needed would be possible without telecoms building and maintaining infrastructure to support it. If everything goes according to plan and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S) merge, there are only three names to choose from on that list -- T-Mobile, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). A lot of people point to Verizon as the winner of the three, but the only telecom I'd be willing to bet on right now is T.   * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now T stock is cheap because the firm is weighed down by a massive debt pile that it acquired beefing up its content library in preparation for a new streaming service. Not everyone believes in AT&T's path forward, which explains the firm's ultra-low valuation. However, I think T stock's future looks bright in the streaming space and its position in 5G means the company has a definite future growth catalyst. With a near 6% dividend yield and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.7, T stock is a cheap way to buy into the revolution. Honeywell International (HON)Source:  josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Another internet of things stock that can't be overlooked is Honeywell (NYSE:HON), an American company responsible for a wide range of connected household devices. Honeywell not only makes everything from connected fire alarms to thermostats for consumers, but the firm also delivers a wide range of connected solutions at the enterprise level as well. There's a lot to like about HON stock from its modest P/E of 18.4 to its respectable 2% dividend yield to the fact that it's been able to grow its earnings per share by 14% annually for the past three years. However, what I find most compelling about Honeywell is the fact that the firm is making big moves into the internet of things space in an unprecedented way. HON is pushing forward with connectivity as a service, a strategy that combines connected wearables with cloud-based applications in order to assist customers in creating more efficient organizations.  DexCom (DXCM)Source: FOOTAGE VECTOR PHOTO / Shutterstock.com It would be irresponsible to talk about internet of things stocks to buy without mentioning at least one healthcare play. The healthcare space holds a lot of potential for growth when it comes to connected devices because data collection is such an important part of the industry. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) makes glucose monitors for people living with diabetes. DXCM stock is up 43% so far this year, though it's been a bumpy ride for investors. In just two years, DXCM is up 128% as its devices gained notoriety and investors started to take notice.   * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Of course there is some risk buying into a stock that's been on a run up, but DexCom looks likely to keep climbing in the years ahead as it rolls out new devices at more affordable price points. DexCom is planning to roll out a new glucose monitor in late 2020 or early 2021 that will be smaller than the firm's G6 model. Its lower manufacturing costs mean it will be less expensive for consumers. Management is hoping that the new G7 model will help the firm break into other markets beyond glucose monitoring which would create an entirely new growth runway. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com Another industry that can't be overlooked when it comes to the internet of things is the semiconductor space. The chips that power connected devices and the networks themselves are an integral part of the overall future of the internet of things. However, choosing which semiconductor stocks to buy right now is a tricky business as the industry has been up against some pretty strong headwinds in recent months. My pick here is Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), a Massachusetts-based semiconductor firm whose share price has been on a roller coaster ride for the past year. The government's ban on sales to Huawei has hurt SWKS stock significantly --  in the third quarter the firm saw its revenue fall 14% and EPS were down a whopping 47%. However, the firm appears to be faring well in areas unaffected by the trade tension. The company is becoming a major player in the 5G space, and its connected chips can now be found in a variety of electronics including soundbars and smartwatches. The firm's tech is also included in Oculus headsets, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) virtual reality arm.So, although you're taking on a lot of risk considering that the trade war with China looks unlikely to let up anytime soon, SWKS could offer a great deal of reward as well. Not only will its connected chips drive growth in the future, but the firm's comparisons in 2020 will be much easier after the dismal year it's had. That means investors who can stomach the risk could see a payoff in just a few months time. Visa (V)Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com Payment processors will be another big beneficiary of a more connected world. As more and more devices make their way online, online payments will continue to rise. Part of the reason connected devices are gaining traction is that they reduce friction in people's lives. Cash has become friction for many people, leading developers to look for easier ways to allow people to pay for things without ever taking out their wallets. The two largest credit card networks, Visa (NYSE:V) and Master Card (NYSE:MA) will be able to continue building their networks as people continue to opt for cashless payments. Don't get me wrong, V stock is expensive -- it trades at almost 29 times its future earnings, but that extra cost is worth it. Visa makes money every time someone uses their credit or debit cards, and with trillions of dollars changing hands in Visa's name each year, that translates into some pretty impressive revenue figures. Guggenheim Securities analyst Jeff Cantwell said he also sees a lot of potential growth in Visa's business to business payments arm. Cantwell pointed out that V stock will benefit significantly as contactless payments spread and Visa pushes its way further into cross-border transactions, a $100 trillion market.As of this writing Laura Hoy was long FB and T.

2019-09-04,"I've been a fan of Square (NYSE:SQ) and its disruptive force in the small business community for quite some time. For me, the long-term narrative for SQ stock has never changed. This is all about providing lesser-known outfits with the tools and resources to compete with the alpha dogs. While disruption often gets a bad rap, with Square, it's mostly positive.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com That said, where I don't get the warm and fuzzies is the market performance of Square stock. On a year-to-date basis, shares have slipped to a return of only 11%. While that's still respectable considering the geopolitical circumstances, SQ was up over 51% YTD as recently as late July.Unfortunately, the markets thought dimly of SQ stock following the payment-processing specialist's second-quarter earnings report. Although Square beat on both the top and bottom line, its per-share profitability guidance for Q3 was notably sub-par. Rather than an earnings per share of 22 cents that analysts forecasted, Square only sees a range between 18 cents to 20 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now Naturally, investors got spooked and punished Square stock. While the volatility is understandable, the magnitude isn't. Yes, there are many headwinds impacting the company's core business. However, the skeptics are not giving an opportunity to let Square's positives shine.Here are three reasons why I think it's premature to give up on SQ stock, even with a possible recession: SQ Evens Things Up for Small BusinessesOn the surface, the present environment seems incredibly negative for SQ stock. Square first jumped to prominence with its square-shaped payment processor. Neatly attaching to a smartphone, it allowed proprietors to deliver the same conveniences to their customers as they would find in a larger company.But in a recession, small businesses are often hit the hardest. It's not difficult to understand why. With limited resources relative to bigger organizations, they typically don't have the capital strength to ride out economic turmoil indefinitely. Therefore, it's also seemingly reasonable that many investors gave up on Square stock.At the same time, small businesses are much nimbler than their larger counterparts. Furthermore, this is a practical advantage that could, in some cases, see the little guy disrupt the top dog.For instance, during a recession, the overall consumer market obviously declines. Thus, some companies may adapt a different approach to sway whatever customers are available. Making this strategy and tactic change, though, is difficult for larger organizations. But small businesses can react quicker, and with Square's comprehensive application ecosystem, they're that much more effective. Modern Amenities Underline Square StockPrior to Square's disruption in the payments-processing industry, small business owners had very few options. They could elect to ink deals with major credit card companies like Mastercard (NYSE:MA) or Visa (NYSE:V), or they could go cash only if they didn't want to pay onerous fees.However, with Square's payment processor, along with recent initiatives like Square Card and their Cash app, the company provides comprehensive modern amenities at reasonable rates. They also open up the door to companies who don't want or cannot get access to traditional financial tools. Particularly, I'm thinking about cannabis-based businesses, which Square quietly but tacitly supports.Sure, it's a risky play. But it offers tremendous opportunities for Square stock, especially as legal momentum builds.But the beauty of platforms like the Cash app is its modularity. For instance, if you want immediate payment transfers to your bank account, Cash provides that for a 1.5% fee. Otherwise, normal transfers (taking one business day) are free. Plus, having all Square transactions under its ecosystem is incredibly beneficial for small businesses, saving time and costs. Logically, this adds to the fundamental value propositions for SQ stock.Finally, I think it's a smart move that Square CEO Jack Dorsey supports cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. Increasingly, the Cash app has tacked on more crypto-related functions. Over time, it will become a fully-fledged crypto resource.How do I know this? No matter what you personally think about cryptos, most millennials love them. And since they're the &quot;it&quot; generation right now, their voice matters the most. International Narrative Supports SQ StockPut aside the investment narrative for SQ stock. When you simply consider its impact in the business community, Square has made profound changes. If you've shopped at independent retail companies, you've almost certainly engaged their products or services.Square wants to spread out. Rather than keeping the intuitive interface and disruptive nature domestic, management is betting that other countries will want to join.As such, I think the company has massive international opportunities, with the biggest in Japan. Even today, Japan has a cash culture that is oddly anachronistic and perhaps ironic. But Square is trying to turn this market, evangelizing the benefits of both the company and the fintech industry.If they succeed, Square stock will enjoy a long-term catalyst. In the meantime, Japan and other international channels offer revenue potential that may help shield SQ from a recession.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Gojek is on track to raise $2 billion in its ongoing funding round before the end of the year, accelerating capital-raising to drive an expansion into mobile payments and food delivery.The ride-hailing giant has now handled about $1.5 billion of transactions outside of Indonesia, thanks to a budding expansion into the rest of Southeast Asia, President Andre Soelistyo told Haslinda Amin on Bloomberg Television. Backed by Google and Tencent Holdings Ltd., Gojek has rapidly grown an international business from scratch after setting up shop in countries like Singapore and Vietnam just nine months prior, he said.Gojek is trying to out-do Singapore-based Grab Holdings Inc. in the provision of a plethora of internet services that both companies hope to build into a coherent, all-purpose super-app. The Indonesian startup had raised about $1 billion from Tencent and others as of early 2019, but it remains on the hunt for capital. Amazon.com Inc. is said to be in talks to join the current round to bolster its presence in Southeast Asia, but Soelistyo declined to comment on potential backers. On Thursday, Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling said it will invest $150 million into artificial intelligence research, staffing and development over the next year to boost its own competing app and services.Read more: Grab Will Invest $150 Million in AI to Build Regional Super App“We can say now we’re not just an Indonesian company,” Soelistyo said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Sooner Than You Think conference in Singapore. Gojek is in “four countries and hopefully soon into six.”’Gojek debuted its app for hailing motorbike taxis in Jakarta in 2015. Since then, it’s evolved into a provider of ride-sharing services, food delivery and a digital wallet. It also offers a dozen other on-demand services such as house cleaning and medicine delivery.As part of the ongoing funding round, Gojek -- valued at $10 billion according to CB Insights -- had also secured investment from Visa Inc., Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank Plc., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mitsubishi Corp. and Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Co. this year.

2019-09-10,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) hit a home run when the company announced its dating feature in the U.S. markets. Match Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) will no longer enjoy the absence of competition in the online dating market. Facebook has a huge user base and now has the chance to leverage Instagram alongside Facebook and the Facebook Dating app.Facebook will help its billions of users find a match based on common interests in events, groups, and hobbies. It will even integrate Instagram so that users may include such posts on their Facebook dating profile. The &quot;Secret Crush&quot; lists allow users to add both their Instagram followers and their friends. By the end of the year, users may add Instagram Stories. Dating Faces Safety ConcernsAfter the data leak, users might express skepticism over Facebook Dating safety. But users must opt in to this new feature. The Dating profile is also separate from a user's main profile. The fundamental difference between Facebook and this Dating feature is that users may choose to get matches with friends, friends of friends, and people not in the friend circle.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors recognized the threat Facebook has on the online dating market. Last week, Match stock fell ~5% to $81.47. The chart watchers saw a &quot;double top&quot; at around $90 on the charts. Government Scrutiny IntensifiesOn Sept. 6, New York State Attorney General Letitia James said she would lead an investigation against Facebook for antitrust issues. &quot;Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers,&quot; she said. &quot;I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk.&quot;  * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy The bad news for investors is that Facebook may have to settle without admitting guilt. The government gets paid but the end-users ultimately pay for the damages.Recall that on July 24 Facebook agreed to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. It will pay a record $5 billion fine over its privacy policies. This amount represents 9% of its 2018 revenue. Still, the company generated revenue of $16.9 billion in the second quarter alone. Much of its revenue is from advertising. So long as add spend from U.S. and Canada grows, Facebook can afford to settle with the government. EU Investigates FacebookMeanwhile, EU antitrust regulators are scrutinizing Facebook's planned Libra currency launch. The EU is worried that the cryptocurrency may shut out rivals and restrict competition through the use of information and consumer data. Sadly, Facebook did not even launch the currency, so the investigation may prove premature. Besides, there are many other well-established payment systems. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) all offer some form of electronic payment options.The EU's pre-emptive strike against Facebook is unwise. It may deter the social networking giant from entering the market. This would pave the way for a China-based firm to come in instead. Conversely, the U.S. banks and credit card companies may get a head start if the EU delays' Facebook's entry in the cryptocurrency market.  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market  Valuation Here and NowInvestors who forecast a ~20% CAGR in a 5-year DCF growth exit model will arrive at a fair value of $196-$273 for Facebook stock. At a 9.5% discount rate, the implied fair value is $228. Its intrinsic value based on future cash flow is even more bullish. Per Simplywall.St, FB stock is more than 20% discounted from its future cash flow and has plenty of upside for shareholders ahead.On Wall Street, Facebook stock has a $234 target average among 36 analysts tracked by TipRanks.Facebook continues to attract healthy advertising spending. It faces no immediate competition from other social networking sites, either.

Since 2006, the WhaleIndex has returned about 370%, crushing the 200% S&P 500 return over that same time frame.Clearly, following the smart money has been the smart move. No pun intended.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September With that in mind, let's take a look at seven stocks that Whale Wisdom says hedge funds love. That is, the seven highest-conviction stocks that hedge funds own the most of, as of second-quarter 13-F filings. Best Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock The most owned stock among hedge funds is technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $735 billion.This seems like an obvious choice for smart money. Microsoft is a blue chip technology giant which has been around forever, has a huge ecosystem of products and services, and most importantly, has found its growth stride again through enterprise cloud services migration and expansion. The company consistently beats Street estimates, has a long track record of cloud-driven double-digit revenue growth, and is benefiting from upside margin drivers which are driving even bigger profit growth.There's a lot to like about the fundamentals supporting MSFT stock. Perhaps the best thing to like is the valuation. Even with all these favorable attributes, MSFT stock still trades at just just 22.8-times forward earnings -- a bargain for a mega-cap, big-growth cloud stock.All in all, then, it makes sense that the smart money loves Microsoft stock. This is a big company with big growth drivers trading at a very reasonable valuation. That's a winning combination that has propelled the stock 100% higher over the past three years. It should propel similarly large gains going forward, too. Apple (AAPL)Source: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com The second-most owned stock among hedge funds is consumer technology giant Apple (NADSAQ:APPL), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $550 billion.Another obvious choice for smart money, Apple has many of the same winning characteristics as Microsoft. This is a blue-chip technology giant with a long track record of growth, and which has created an ecosystem of consumer technology hardware products that over a billion people around the world use every day. The first part of the Apple growth narrative was all about building out that hardware ecosystem. The second part -- which the company is transitioning to now -- is all about monetizing that ecosystem with software subscription services, like Apple TV+ and Apple Music.In other words, this company has a history of a big growth, and a very smart game-plan to sustain that big growth for the foreseeable future. At the same time, software businesses carry higher margins than hardware businesses, so this pivot to software-focused growth is also additive to margins and should super-charge profit growth.Apple has a robust profit growth trajectory ahead of it. Even with that robust profit growth outlook, AAPL stock still trades at less than 18-times forward earnings -- the lowest multiple in the entire mega-cap technology group.  * 7 Automotive Stocks to Buy Now As such, with Apple (much like Microsoft) you have a host of favorable characteristics on top of a reasonable valuation. This has driven big gains in the stock over the past several years, and should continue to do so. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Zapp2Photo / Shutterstock.com The third most owned stock among hedge funds is e-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NADSAQ:AMZN), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $515 billion.Hedge funds have fallen in love with Amazon stock for two big reasons. One, we live in the era of the growth trade, supported by the fact that interest rates are very low and Treasury yields globally are near record lows (and often in negative territory). When rates are low, the growth trade works. That's because growth stocks derive most of their value from future profits, and when rates are low, the present value of those future profits increases because the discount rate used to discount back those future profits goes down.Two, Amazon is the king of the growth stocks. This is a company which consistently fires off 20%-plus revenue growth rates on anemic margins, under the promise that one day, the company will dominate its addressable markets, ease its growth spend, and expand margins on a huge revenue base. As such, this company is all about deriving its value from future profits. Given the company's huge revenue base, those future profits could one day be very, very big. Thus, we live in a low rate world that is perfect for Amazon stock to succeed.All in all, it should be no surprise that AMZN stock has turned into a hedge fund favorite. This is the king of the growth stocks, in an era where growth stocks rule the land.The reality is that so long as rates remain depressed, growth stocks should continue to out-perform, and AMZN stock will continue to grind higher. Facebook (FB)Source: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com The fourth most owned stock among hedge funds is social media giant Facebook (NADSAQ:FB), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $345 billion.Facebook being a hedge fund favorite likely has to do with the fact that Facebook is the ideal GARP, or growth-at-a-reasonable-price, stock. Consider this: Facebook has largely been for its entire history as a public company a 20%-plus revenue growth company. It remains so today, and projects to remain in 20%-plus revenue growth territory for the next few years.At the same time, operating margins used to be at 50%. Sure, they have come down dramatically since the Cambridge Analytica scandal forced the company to spend more on data security. But, margins are bottoming in the mid-30% range, and should move higher going forward.Thus, this is a 20%-plus revenue growth company with upside margin drivers. That combination implies 25%-plus profit growth potential here. FB stock trades at just 23-times forward earnings for that 25%-plus profit growth potential. That's a bargain which hedge funds clearly love.  * 8 Precious Metals Stocks to Mine For Even further, Facebook's 25%-plus profit growth potential is supported by the fact that 2.7 billion globally use one of the company's four apps every single month, and that the 2.7 billion number has never done anything besides go up. In other words, it's a very well-supported 25%-plus profit growth company, trading at a discounted valuation. That's a recipe for big share price gains. Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock The fifth most owned stock among hedge funds is global payments giant Visa (NYSE:V), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $275 billion.Hedge funds love Visa for six very simple reasons. One, Visa operates in the secular growth card payments space. In 2018, payment cards generated 368.92 billion purchase transactions for goods and services, up nearly 25% year-over-year from 2017. Two, Visa dominates this 25% growth space, accounting for nearly 45% of those 369 billion transactions in 2018. Three, Visa's dominance in the secular growth card payments space has consistently powered high single-digit to double-digit volume, transaction, and revenue growth over the past few years.Four, margins are stable and big. Five, healthy revenue growth plus stable and big margins has powered and continues to power robust profit growth. Six, for that robust profit growth, Visa stock trades at just 33-times forward earnings -- which, while not cheap, is certainly reasonable for a company that is as dominant and has as much visibility and growth potential as Visa.As such, it makes sense that hedge funds love Visa stock. This company has all the attributes of a long term winning investments. Those attributes aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Thus, Visa stock will continue to look and act like a long term winner. JP Morgan (JPM)Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com The sixth most owned stock among hedge funds is banking giant JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $255 billion.The first five stocks on this list were arguably all technology companies. But, hedge funds can't exclusively love technology stocks -- they, like every other investor, need to diversify their exposure to the market. One way to do that? Buy a bank stock for financial sector exposure. When buying bank stocks, hedge funds have most often opted for JP Morgan.Why? A few reasons. For starter's, JP Morgan is the largest bank in the U.S., so it's an obvious choice when seeking financial sector exposure. Also, JP Morgan has consistently operated at a higher clip than its peers over the past several years. Over the past three years, JPM stock is up more than 60%, versus a 35% gain for the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF). Even further, JPM has been exceptionally innovative on the technology front, doing things like partnering with Amazon on a credit card.Big picture, hedge funds need bank exposure, too, and when seeking that bank exposure, they have most often bought JPM stock because JPM is bigger, better, and innovating faster than its peers.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now Does that mean JPM stock will continue to move higher? Probably not. So long as the yield curve remains inverted and &quot;lower for longer&quot; remains the theme in the yields world, JPM stock will struggle to move higher. Those conditions simply are not favorable for bank stocks. Alphabet (GOOGL)Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com The seventh most owned stock among hedge funds is digital ad and cloud giant Alphabet (NADSAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), with an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $250 billion.To be fair, Whale Wisdom separates GOOG and GOOGL into two different entries, each of which had an aggregate second quarter 13-F holding value of $250 billion. Thus, the total holding value in all of Alphabet stock (GOOG and GOOGL) is about $500 billion, which would peg it as the fourth -- not seventh -- most owned stock among hedge funds.It makes sense that Alphabet would be so high on hedge funds' buy list. This is a company which has built the backbone of the internet with Google Search. Everyone and their best friend in the world uses that backbone. Alphabet has leveraged the utility of Google Search to develop a broad ecosystem of widely used software services (Gmail, YouTube, Google Docs, etc), and has monetized that ecosystem with ads, ads, and more ads.This strategy has worked. Now, Alphabet is the unchallenged titan in the global digital ad industry. That industry is growing at a 20%-plus pace. On top of that, Alphabet has also created a leading cloud infrastructure services business that operates in the 20%-plus growth cloud sector, is building out an ecosystem of consumer technology hardware products that are rapidly gaining, and has turned into the clear leader in the self-driving space with its Waymo unit.In other words, there are multiple growth drivers here, all of which have the potential to produce huge profits at scale. As such, Alphabet remains a big growth company. For all that growth, GOOG stock trades at just 22-times forward earnings.That's a combination that has powered big gains in GOOG stock over the past several years. It should continue to do for the next several years, too.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN, FB, and GOOG.

2019-09-11,"U.S. stock futures are trading higher this morning in what looks to be a quiet open for the market. Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.17% and S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.13%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.17%.Source: Shutterstock In the options pits, call volume saw a modest uptick, helping to drive overall volume above average levels. Specifically, about 21.7 million calls and 17.9 million puts changed hands on the session.At the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.65 -- a one-week high, and the dead center of its 2019 range. The 10-day moving average held its ground at 0.65.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOptions traders swarmed in Ford (NYSE:F),Visa (NYSE:V) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) among others. Below we'll explore the catalysts and investigate their price action. Ford Motors (F)Volatility seized Ford shares yesterday after the automaker saw its credit downgraded to junk by Moody's. The ratings agency believes Ford sits in a poor financial position for its multi-billion dollar restructuring. Traders viewed the stock's large down gap as a buying opportunity, however.Initially, the company saw its shares open down 5%, but bulls swarmed to pare the losses to just 1.26% by day's end. Trading volumes surged to over 70 million shares for the session, marking the highest volume day since late-July. The price trend of Ford stock leaves much to be desired. It rests below its 50-day moving average but above the 20-day and 200-day. The mixed messages suggests neutrality more than anything.  * 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Despite the Headlines While the trend gives traders little to latch on to, the beefy 6.37% dividend is likely sufficient to keep income seekers targeting the stock for the foreseeable future.On the options trading front, calls slightly outpaced puts on the day. Activity swelled to 335% of the average daily volume, with 145,384 total contracts traded. The increased demand drove implied volatility up to 34%, placing it at the 24th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of 20 cents or 2.1%. Visa (V)Credit card stocks have not fared well over the past two sessions. Visa has fallen almost 6% from Monday's intraday high on above-average volume. Yesterday's whack pushed V stock back below its 50-day moving average. Normally that kind of breach would question a stock's uptrend, but Visa has seen multiple probes below the 50-day during its trend and few have actually mattered.Bottom line: this is probably a dip worth buying.On the options trading front, speculators favored calls throughout the session. Total activity jumped to 220% of the average daily volume, with 114,740 contracts traded. Calls claimed 53% of the take.Implied volatility cruised higher to 23% and now sits at the 27th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $2.57 or 1.5% so set your expectations accordingly. Roku (ROKU)Roku stock is finally receiving its comeuppance. Monday's wicked bearish engulfing candle marked a short-term top and yesterday's epic plunge confirmed the easy money in its upswing is over. ROKU stock has fallen 18.4% over the past two days.The action reminds me of the old trading adage, &quot;bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered.&quot; Roku's ascent had long since left the stratosphere and was well on its way to the moon when profit-taking and the inevitable pullback commenced. And, like so many gravity-defying rallies before it, Roku learned that gravity always wins in the end.  * 7 Upcoming IPOs for September On a positive note, because ROKU had risen so far off of support and its major moving averages, this pullback hasn't broken any critical support levels. With its overall trend still pointing higher, it might just need a reset or time of rest before eventually moving higher.On the options trading front activity pushed to 218% of the average daily volume, with 309,379 total contracts traded. Calls barely inched out puts driving 51% of the session's sum.Implied volatility rallied to 66%, placing it at the 32nd percentile of its one-year range. Selling bull puts is the way to go if you're in the mood for buying the dip.As of this writing, Tyler Craig held bullish options positions in Roku.

2019-09-11,"Despite a sharp pullback over the past two trading day, Visa (NYSE:V) stock remains higher by more than 30% year-to-date. While in the bigger picture V stock is certainly nearing overbought readings, in the near to intermediate term, the stock is trending higher. And, at the bottom end of the trading range here, the stock is ripe for a bounce trade.Source: Shutterstock Many disagreements between market participants around any given stock's appreciation potential could immediately be put to rest if they would disclose what time frame their views are in. In the world of charts and technical analysis, successful traders know that a near-term view on a stock has nearly nothing to do with an intermediate-term or longer-term chart.In other words, while we always want to gain perspective on any given trade setup through the lens of different time frames, a stock at any given point is usually not a &quot;buy&quot; or a &quot;sell&quot; in all time frames simultaneously.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips V Stock ChartsTo wit, looking at the multi-year chart of Visa stock we see that over time it has continuously steepened its slope. Year-to-date the stock has also begun to notably narrow its trading range while leaving most momentum oscillators (bottom of chart) in serious overbought readings. While this is concerning in the longer-term, and it could thus lead to a serious mean-reversion move lower over time, in the near term, the trend in Visa stock continues.  * 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Despite the Headlines On the daily chart we see that V stock, for the most part thus far in 2019, has pushed higher in a well-defined range as marked by the two purple parallels. The bearish reversal over the past two trading days, which measures nearly -5.50% so far, has pulled the stock down to the lower end of the trading range. Furthermore, this lower boundary also roughly coincides with the blue 100-day simple moving average as further potential solidification of support.While I am one to respect bearish reversals such as the ones we witnessed in V stock so far this week, I am also wanting to respect the year-to-date up-trend.My favorite way to look for entry points to buy V stock at this juncture is using a specific candlestick pattern. Join me on Wednesday Sept. 11 for a special webinar for InvestorPlace readers where I will teach this high-probability candlestick pattern.Right now, active investors and traders could look to buy Visa stock around the $175 area, using a first upside target at $185 and a stop loss at $171.Join Serge's special webinar to InvestorPlace readers where he will teach his highest probability candlestick pattern for rapid bullish and bearish reversals.

2019-09-12,S&P; 500 gains 0.29% Continue reading...,US Indexes Gain on Thursday With Improved Global Outlook
2019-09-12,"Stocks traded higher again Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average positioned for a seventh consecutive winning day as the European Central Bank (ECB) delved further into easy monetary, and amid news that trade tensions between the U.S. and China continue to thaw.Source: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com Given President Donald Trump's Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) volatility, it's wise to approach good trade news with some caution, but over the course of this week, some green shoots have emerged.The White House pledge to push back some proposed tariffs on Chinese goods while China is promising to rollback some levies on U.S. imports in conjunction with upping purchases of American farm products.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday, reports emerged that the White House has discussed offering some form of a limited trade pact to China. Whether or not that agreement is accepted remains to be seen, but the overarching issue is that both sides, at least for now, are showing willingness to work on trade deals.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now In Europe, the ECB cut its benchmark lending rate to -0.5% and pledged to buy $22 billion worth of euro-denominated bonds per month.Those headlines got us to the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.30% today while the S&P 500 jumped 0.29%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 0.17%. In late trading, 23 of the 30 Dow stocks, one of the better ratios this week, were trading higher. First, the Bad NewsYes, there were some glum performances among Dow stocks today. For example, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) slipped about 1% after Wells Fargo downgraded the construction machinery maker to &quot;market perform&quot; from &quot;outperform.&quot; The bank also pared its price target on that Dow stock to $143 from $150.&quot;U.S. construction equipment demand is at or near peak, which will put downward pressure on earnings power,&quot; said Wells Fargo.On a technical basis, Caterpillar recently bumped into some overhead resistance and looking at the chart, the shares look primed to pull back over the near-term.Speaking of analyst chatter hurting Dow stocks, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was the worst-performing Dow stock today, sliding over 4% after Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill initiated coverage of the stock with a &quot;sell&quot; rating.Hill had a tepid take on Dow stock UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), starting coverage of that laggard with a &quot;hold&quot; rating. Shares of UNH also finished lower today. Bright Spots on the DowVisa (NYSE:V) was the best-performing Dow stock today, adding 1.71%. It looks like buyers stepped into the name after the shares pulled back following a record close last Friday. The stock had been nearly 4% over the past several days.Shares of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) added nearly 1% after the largest U.S. retailer unveiled an expansion to its grocery delivering service. Priced at $98 annually, or $82 less per year than the fee on Amazon Fresh.Whether its streaming entertainment or food delivery, pricing power matters. Companies that can offer it without disrupting the long case for their stocks usually get a boost from investors. Walmart plans to expand the new grocery delivery service to 200 metro areas across the country.Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) bounced back today as some of the concerns about Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) streaming effort ebbed.Disney has its own streaming plans, Disney +, and Credit Suisse says that if that offering can attract 10 million subscribers by the end of this year, that could bring double-digit upside for the stock. DJIA Bottom LineCentral banks around the world are acting to prop up economies that are in far worse shape than the U.S., and it's likely the Federal Reserve will follow suit to avoid having to act when it's too late.In comments made in Chicago today, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen affirmed that the Fed stands at the ready to shore up the world's largest economy, which she still views as solid. However, she doesn't believe the central bank will follow the ECB playbook of negative rates.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"For the last few days the stock markets have been healthy. Sentiment has taken a turn to positive and it's like nothing bad is ever going to happen again. Just yesterday the indices rallied through incredible levels especially in small cap stocks. So there's no doubt that there are stocks to buy here.Today we discuss three high-profile stocks to buy: Visa (NYSE:V), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These are fallen angels stocks because they have recently corrected off of their highs just when they looked like their rallies would never end.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now The time frames differ among them, but the concept remains the same. They were headed to the moon, then they tripped. So now the opportunity is to pick the right level to buy these stocks. All three management teams are impeccable and they rarely falter on their own. So the bullish thesis for all three AMZN, MSFT and V assumes that markets in general are not going to crash any time soon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Microsoft (MSFT)It's hard to call MSFT stock a fallen angel stock because it's still up 34% year-to-date  and it's only 5% off of the highs. Nevertheless, it has had a tough time in the last trading week, and what makes it interesting is that it did this while the equity markets were rallying hard.Normally, this raises an alarm and causes me to look into weaknesses which would bring sustained selling. But that's not the case here. This is a proven company who is merely having a normal price action give-and-take inside a very healthy ascending trend.Fundamentally MSFT is not cheap since it sells at 29 trailing price-to-earnings ratio and 8 times sales. But this is a company that deserves the benefit of the doubt so it is possible that they deliver strong growth to justify the higher valuations.This is all to say that Microsoft stock is not cheap but it still is a good one to own for the long term. So these dips are normal and should not cause a panic out of the stock.Technically, the zone around $130 per share is pivotal for MSFT stock. This was resistance in April, then a break out in June, and then a successful test for support in early August when markets fell in fear of the 10% additional tariffs tweet. So clearly the bulls earned the right to use it that support.Knowing this, makes it possible for the buy-programs to prevail over the bears in the battle over MSFT for as long as the equity markets are healthy. If I own shares, I don't panic out of them on these dips. Moreover, if I want to own some for the future then this is as good a time as any to start a position there.Alternatively I can use options to sell puts or spreads below said support to generate income without needing rallies. For this, it is important to note that if stocks correct this year from geopolitical risk, then Microsoft stock is vulnerable to a 12% correction. Visa (V)V stock is in a similar situation to that of Microsoft. It's a proven winner that was seemingly rallying to the moon without interruption. But then in the last few days, it fell 6% while the general markets are up big.Here too, the drop is not a reflection on Visa itself but rather part of normal price action. For the longest time credit card stocks with a presence in the fintech space like Visa and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) have been darlings because the investment dollars allotted to bet on financials shied away from buying money-center banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). Instead they piled into fintech.However the recent rally in yields caused a frenzied wave of buying the traditional banks and money has to come from the same bucket. So there is a rotation out of winners like V stock into laggards. The opportunity here is that rotations are usually temporary. Meaning the dip in Visa stock should be a buying opportunity.Just like Microsoft, Visa is not cheap. It sells at 35 trailing P/E and 18 times its sales. But this alone is not cause for alarm because that's how it's always been. So unless the bears have developed sudden incredible fortitude, I bet that the selling will abate soon.Technically, Visa stock should have support around $172 per share. Moreover there is bigger support from pivotal zones at $165 per share. So if I owned shares I don't panic yet. If seeking a long entry with room to spare, I like to sell puts into support zones on bad days to generate income as long as I can gauge the risk.  * 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Despite the Headlines Visa stock is 7% off its highs, so if I sell a put in V stock at $160 per share I would own it after a 15% correction. This is a risk I can tolerate and I bet would be a fruitful one. I should know that there is short-term risk looming. if Visa falls below $183.75, it could invite sellers to $168 per share. Amazon (AMZN)I cannot write about potential upside of fallen angels stocks without including the biggest momentum story of all time. AMZN stock is one that has been in the news for decades. It draws critics and fans in droves and is subject to many a heated debate.After the May correction, Amazon stock made a nice recovery but it gave almost all of it back. And it now sits 10% lower than the July highs. The size of the moves in Amazon stock should never surprise investors. This is the mother of all momentum stocks and when it moves, it does it fast and long. So it is best to wait for confirmation of breakouts in either direction before trading it.Short term, Amazon stock rallies if above $1,853 per share,  and could even recover what they lost since July. There will be resistance points along the way so it won't be easy. Conversely, if it falls below recent support near $1,740 then they could extend the correction down to $1,600 per share.In essence, the battle is between completing an ABC technical move lower or establishing a base for a rebound rally to breakout from the necklines above. Meanwhile, the AMZN stock is ping-ponging inside a tight range and I should chase the break out of either sides. I personally favor the upside potential for as long as the markets in general are healthy.For those thinking of turning this into an investment, Amazon is a safe bet in the long run in spite of its high valuation. It sells at 75 trailing P/E but only 3.4 x sales. So as long as they are delivering growth, a high P/E is a prerequisite. You have to spend a lot in order to grow a lot.We still have the same geopolitical risks we had when we first started this correction. So we are one headline away from rekindled panics.

2019-09-12,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the move thanks to an improved trade war outlook after China offered to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products if the U.S. lessened restrictions on Huawei last week. The index, which is comprised of 30 American blue chip stocks, has climbed 3% in the last five days. This has not escaped the Street’s attention, with analysts saying that a few Dow stocks are heating up.“It seems like the tone on trade has gotten better. As long as we don’t have another tweet storm around trade, I think the market can stay in the upper end of this range,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. Using the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we were able to see how a few of the index’s stocks measure up against each other. We just typed in up to seven tickers and the tool compared each of the stocks based on market cap, PE ratio, analyst consensus and average analyst price target. Based on the results from the comparison, we were able to find 3 Dow stocks that have garnered substantial support from Wall Street with a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. This is based on the last three months’ worth of ratings from all other analysts.    Let’s take a closer look. Visa Inc. Visa Inc. (V– Get Report) has had a tough week, with the payments processor seeing shares plummet almost 6% in the last three days. A few analysts say that the stock market's &quot;sector rotation&quot; as investors rotate out of big winners and into the biggest underperformers ahead of year end was to blame for this dip. That being said, some analysts are telling investors that its core strategy will pay off long-term. Even with the pullback Visa shares have gained 33% year-to-date, with the company standing to reap the benefits as the world goes cashless. According to its July 23 fiscal Q3 2019 earnings release, the company looks solid. Total payments volume, the dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying Visa’s branding, jumped almost 9% year-over-year to reach $2.23 trillion on a constant dollar basis. To further capitalize on the cashless payments movement, the company recently partnered with MoneyGram (MGI) on a peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer option that lets customers in the U.S. send money domestically through the MGI website or app to an eligible debit card. The product, which was unveiled on September 9, starts at $1.99 and enables 24-7 transfers using Visa’s real-time push payment platform, Visa Direct.Adding to the good news, the Foreign Trade Commission (FTC) granted antitrust clearance for Visa’s acquisition of Verifi. The deal will give V access to improved dispute management technology. One top analyst points out that its substantial efforts to expand its business to business (B2B) payments arm are especially exciting, highlighting its July PayMate investment and Rambus acquisition back in June. As a result, Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell reiterated his Buy rating and $199 price target on August 28. The five-star analyst sees potential for 14% upside.All in all, Wall Street agrees with Cantwell. Visa boasts a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus as well as a $202 average price target, indicating 14% upside potential.  McDonald's Corporation With the fast food company already gaining 18% year-to-date, some analysts believe investors should still put McDonald’s Corporation (MCD– Get Report) on their plates.While MCD is known as a burger chain, the company is making a name for itself as a tech company thanks to its significant focus on digitization. These efforts include products to speed up ordering and fulfillment such as self-ordering kiosks in many of its locations. Management noted in its July 26 Q2 earnings release that its global comparable sales growth shows the kiosks are already paying off, as customers tend to order more food or extra side items when compared to traditional ordering.  With its mobile app, diners have the option to choose the time and pickup method. Not to mention the app can be synced with a user’s digital payment wallet. To further strengthen its delivery options, MCD announced its partnership with online food delivery service DoorDash in July. Most exciting though is the fast food giant’s foray into the world of artificial intelligence (AI). The company announced on September 10 that it’s set to acquire voice-based AI startup Apprente in order to improve the drive-thru experience. The startup, which will be housed under the new “McD Tech Labs” unit, will allow MCD to create voice-activated drive-thrus, speeding up the process as well as requiring less staff to operate restaurants. This is on top of its $300 million acquisition of online personalization company Dynamic Yield back in March.While some investors originally expressed concerns over MCD’s discounted pricing, SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett believes the above factors will keep MCD on an upward trajectory. “We think the MCD buy-one-get-one for $1 promotion shows an effort to drive traffic, but also highlights the restaurant chain's focus on franchisee profitability,” he explained. As a result, he reiterated his Buy rating and $246 average price target on August 27. The five-star analyst believes shares could gain 17% over the next twelve months.   With 16 Buy ratings vs 5 Holds assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that MCD is a ‘Strong Buy’. Its $231 average price target suggests 9% upside potential.  The Walt Disney CompanyDisney (DIS&#92;- Get Report) has attracted substantial buzz from the Street thanks to its new streaming service, Disney+, with shares already gaining 24% year-to-date. That being said, the house of mouse has seen shares dip 2% in the last three days thanks to Apple’s (AAPL) product update on September 10.Apple announced at its September 2019 Keynote that its new streaming service, Apple TV+, will start at a much lower price point than previously expected. After its November 1 launch, Apple TV+ will be available starting at $4.99 per month. This directly undercuts Disney as its own service will start at $6.99 per month, with the premium bundle running at $12.99 per month. It should be noted that Apple’s streaming service will feature less content than Disney’s.  One top analyst believes that competition from Apple doesn’t change Disney’s strong long-term growth narrative. Credit Suisse’s Douglas Mitchelson conducted a survey of 40 investors in order to measure investor sentiment. The headline results were resoundingly bullish, with 58% now overweight vs 37% pre-Analyst Day in April as the Disney+ launch on November 12 is expected to be a major catalyst. That being said, in order to see significant upside Disney will need a big launch. DIS should also get a boost from its collaboration with Target (TGT) that includes the opening of 25 Disney stores within TGT locations on October 4. Investors have yet another reason to be excited as the company has an ambitious plan to give its Epcot theme park a major upgrade with new interactive elements, show space and new rides based on popular Disney films.Based on all of the above factors, Mitchelson reiterated his Buy rating and $150 price target. The 4.5-star analyst thinks shares could surge 10% over the next twelve months. 10 Buy ratings and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months add up to a ‘Strong Buy’ analyst consensus. Its average price target of $158 implies 16% upside potential.

2019-09-16,"Over the past decade, Square (NYSE:SQ) has become a dominant player in the mobile payments and financing sphere. And the SQ stock price since 2015 has reflected the company's exponential growth.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com However, Square stock is off its recent highs, as the shares got penalized following its second-quarter earnings report in August. Year-to-date, the SQ stock price is basically flat. Now may be a good time to ask why Square shares have been falling and what we can expect in the final quarter of 2019.I believe that the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. In the coming weeks, I'd be a buyer below $55, especially if the price approaches or even goes below $50. Here are the must-know fundamental metric and price levels for SQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Stock's Q3 Guidance Failed to ImpressSquare was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Its payments processing business, also referred to as &quot;payments as a service,&quot; has been a game changer in serving small businesses. To the delight of early investors, this innovative financial services company has expanded quickly and become a disruptor.SQ stock reported Q2 earnings on Aug. 1 after market close. Notably, the payment-solutions company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Its total net revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street's expectation of 17 cents per share. A year ago in Q3, Square stock's adjusted earnings per share came in at 13 cents.Square's subscription and services-based revenue also increased 87% to $251 million. Gross payment volume of $26.8 billion increased from $21.4 billion year-over-year. This growth has been driven by its Cash App, Square Capital and Instant Deposit. Analysts were especially impressed with Cash App -- quarterly revenue came at $135 million.The quarterly report once again confirmed that Square stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company's lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Its Q3 adjusted-EPS guidance of 18 cents to 20 cents trailed the average estimate of 22 cents. Square management now expects Q3 adjusted revenue to be between $590 million and $600 million as opposed to the consensus of $599 million.Square stock's losses on the bottom line are also projected to be higher than expected. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide. Where SQ Stock's Price Is NowThe U.S. stock market has had several big winners in the past year. However, Square stock has not been one of them. Over the past 12 months, SQ shares are down about 36%.Let us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the years to have a better view on what to expect in the coming weeks.Following SQ stock's IPO in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, shares have been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.After a highly volatile first half of 2019, August has not been a good month for Square shares either. That's of course due to the weak Q3 guidance which has underwhelmed investors.On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. Now the shares are hovering around $58.From a technical perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be rangebound between $50 and $55.Plus, based on options trading, many bets are being placed that Square shares will see $50 before too long.The upside momentum can build up only when long-term investors feel that the SQ stock price justifies the future growth expectations. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing Square stock at this point. Square Stock Is Still Richly ValuedAlthough the decline in Square's stock has improved the valuation, the shares are still richly valued.While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has questions about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.  And unless it increases its revenue, Wall Street may take the high valuation of SQ stock down even further.The expansion of Square's ecosystem also means that SQ is facing increased competition. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction-processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv  (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global-payments giant.Most SQ stock holders are well aware that the shares do not trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios, especially compared to its competitors. For example, SQ's forward price-to-earnings ratio is over 50. On the other hand forward P/E ratios for PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about 30, 28 and 26 respectively.Similarly Square stock's current price-to-sales ratio is over 6.3x. Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective, S&P 500's average price-to-sales ratio is 2.1x.In short, I do not think there is much room for Square stock's valuation to head higher in the final quarter of the year. Sooner or later, SQ stock's valuation and revenue growth will be more in balance. Should You Buy SQ Stock?The fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against SQ stock. In the short term, though, stakeholders shouldn't expect smooth sailing.I believe the volatility and selling in the markets will continue in September as well as in early October. Like many momentum plays, SQ stock is likely to be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.Square is a high beta stock at 3.3. The stock market has a beta of 1.0. SQ stock's beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, Square stock rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling. Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock's wide daily swings.It is likely that Square shares will fall toward $50, where I'd expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until the next earnings release, expected in early November.Indeed, Square stock may become one of the first momentum stocks to test the lows it saw between $49-$50 in December 2018, hence making a double bottom in technical charts. Only then the twice-touched low may become a more reliable long-term support level.In other words, I'd not rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I'd get ready to initiate a position as the price declines further, toward $50.At the time of writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-17,"The stock market's major indices are at or near all-time highs, and as stocks go up, dividend yields go down. As a result, many of the best dividend stocks to buy right now sport relatively modest yields.That's OK. Because your focus also should be on dividend safety and payout growth that will enhance your yield over time.Not every stock has been caught up in 2019's surge to new peaks. GameStop (GME), CenturyLink (CTL), Vodafone (VOD), Pitney Bowes (PBI), L Brands (LB), Deutsche Bank (DB) - all of these well-known companies have either cut or outright suspended their dividends this year. Those moves were a blow to all existing shareholders, but especially those who were relying on the income from these sometimes generous dividend payers to tackle regular expenses in retirement.How do you ensure the dividend stocks you're invested in won't do the same? One way is to monitor the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares. DIVCON's methodology uses a five-tier rating to provide a snapshot of companies' dividend health, where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase, and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut. And within each of these ratings is a composite score determined by cash flow, earnings, stock buybacks and other factors.These are 13 of the safest dividend stocks to buy right now. Each stock has not only achieved a DIVCON 5 score, but a composite score within the top 15 of all stocks that DIVCON has evaluated. This makes them the crème de la crème of dividend safety - and more likely to keep the dividend increases coming going forward.

2019-09-17,"Visa (NYSE:V), seeking entrance into the center of 21st century banking, has joined MasterCard (NYSE:MA) in taking a stake in fintech startup Plaid. Plaid writes application program interfaces that act as the infrastructure beneath bank accounts. This lets it power customer-facing fintech specialists like PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo, Robinhood, Chime and Betterment.Source: Shutterstock Enabling new banking services could make Plaid a sort of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the fintech age -- an operating system for computerized banking.Plaid has attracted $310 million in financing. Its most recent funding round valued it at $2.7 billion. Other backers include Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut it's Visa and MasterCard, which have a joint value of almost $700 billion, that are the real get. They have global scale, brand names and good reputations for security and reliability. Battling AlibabaPlaid is ranked as the eighth largest fintech startup. The list is led by credit card issuer Stripe and includes SoFi, a lender whose name will grace the new Los Angeles football stadium. Fintech companies raised a total of nearly $40 billion last year.Fintech startups are trying to get around the high costs of working with the present banking system. Visa and Mastercard are part of that. But Visa and Mastercard are also trying to get around those costs, seeing the growth of chat-based Chinese payment systems from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holding (OTCMKTS:TCEHY).  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip There was an assumption that Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra -- a cheaper payment system riding on FB's data network -- might be the first to escape the high costs. Both Visa and MasterCard were part of Libra's 28-member founding group announced in June. But there are increasing doubts that financial regulators will allow Libra to launch, as many fear Facebook's size. These regulators seem to have no such fears regarding the payment processors. The Fintech StackThe investment in Plaid, which already serves cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, brings Visa and MasterCard closer to the new financial world's operating system.Fintech is building a new financial payments stack. Right now, most of the value in the stack is in the loans it creates or the investments it enables. But as the software stack evolves, history shows that it's the company at the bottom of that stack that gains the most power, as Microsoft did starting in the early 1990s.Plaid CEO Zach Perret said his goal is to create a digitized financial system. Visa executive Bill Sheedy said his strategic goal is more important than the financial investment.That strategic goal increasingly looks like a bank. Verifying users and account balances is key to enabling loans, payments and investment -- essentially all the functions of banks like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Visa stock's market cap exceeded that of JPMorgan just in the last year. Many Plaid customers compete directly with banks like JPMorgan. The Bottom Line for Visa Stock and PlaidWhile Visa's payment network has proven to have enormous financial power, it still faces challenges. It can charge merchants up to 3% of a transaction's cost to process through its network. The money is soaked up by processors and banks that are part of the Visa stock network.These payment networks won't work in developing nations. The cost is too high for small merchants to bear. Instead of staying with cash, many are moving to cheaper fintech alternatives that can run through customers' mobile phones.Whether these merchants will stay with Chinese and Indian payment systems, or seek Western alternatives to access Western wallets, remains an open question. The Plaid investment shows just how desperate Visa and Mastercard are to answer that question in the affirmative.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-09-17,"Square (NYSE:SQ), the San Francisco based payment processor, had been on a roll. Since its initial IPO in November 2015 with the SQ stock price at $58, investors who got in early rode the price up to over $101 in September 2018. Since then, however, it has been an all-downhill roller coaster.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Square stock recently closed back down to the IPO price of $58, and may yet again test its all-time low of $49. The underlying technology for Square stock by all accounts is undoubtedly sound. The market may be cool on SQ stock, but customers like the service.Square has steady increased top-line revenues every year. In fact, from the pre-IPO days of the creation of Square by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) founder Jack Dorsey back in 2011, revenues have increased more than 15-fold. However, Square stock has yet to generate positive net income.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now As the hard-pressed investors of Uber (NASDAQ:UBER) stock know all too well, dazzling technology and great top-line revenue growth are all swell. But if there is no positive net income in sight and losses keep growing by staggering amounts, there is no reason to hold the stock.Despite robust sales growth, just within days after reporting disappointing second-quarter earnings announced on Aug. 1st, Square stock dropped around 40%. Similarly, the shares of Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) - comparative payment processors - have also been struggling in the market.When it comes to the tech sector nowadays, investors are getting tired of talk and want to see some beef on the bones in terms of bottom line earnings. Or they vote with their feet.With the massive sell-off in SQ stock, will the bears finally back off?Here are two reasons why Square is now becoming a great value play in the FinTech sector. Free Stock Trades Will Drive New Revenues, Enhance SQ ValuationAccording to a recent report in Bloomberg, Square is in the initial stages of testing a new feature allowing users of its Cash App service to buy and sell listed U.S. equities for free. A free stock trading functionality would put Square into direct competition with Robinhood, an online broker launched as a smartphone app in 2014.  Backed by the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, Robinhood is valued at approximately $7.6 billion.Many skeptics will wonder what the point is about spending heavily to launch and maintain a free service. As many analysts of the online brokerage wars know all too well, free stock trades are akin to a bar offering free salty peanuts to customers. After eating the free peanuts, those customers soon pony up the cash to buy expensive drinks. The trading of stocks may be free, but everything else comes at a price.Robinhood, for example, will charge a premium for offering investors telephone advice, foreign stock transactions, interest on uninvested cash holdings, as well as interest on margin loans. Robinhood will also sell to a captive market other high margin financial products such as credit cards, insurance and auto loans. Similarly, for Square, offering users free stock trades will attract more users and drive more volume and thus revenues to their payment processing services.Offering free stock trades will not be the first free service for Square. In their recent earnings statement, Square noted that they offer their existing Cash App clients peer-to-peer cash transfer service for free as a marketing tool to drive new business. SQ Is Best in Class Infrastructure - And Getting BetterMobile payments processing is still a nascent industry just at the beginning of growth. According to the consulting firm McKinsey, the global payments industry is a $1.9-trillion business. Much like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Twitter in the early years, Square admittedly is less concerned with profitability and far more concerned with building their engineering platform to compete and win in the market against the giants of the financial services industry.According to the most recent earnings release for the second quarter of 2019, product development expenses for Square stock were $174 million in the second quarter of 2019, up 52% year-over-year. This increase was driven primarily by costs related to engineering, data science, and technical design.In short, Square is spending heavily on technology to out-build and beat the competition for the future of the industry. Bottom Line on SQ StockThere is certainly no shortage of deep-pocketed competitors in the payment processing business. In fact, recent months have seen Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) announce major new investments in their payment solutions offering.Yet, Square stock has been showing a decent support level at the $50 to $52 range. Square stock represents a proven and solid value play in what is usually a risky and overvalued FinTech sector.At the time of writing, Theodore Kim, CFA,  holds no position in any of the stocks mentioned above.

Here's why, and what to look for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Coca-Cola (KO)It has been one of the healthier trades this year, despite the drinking public's growing aversion to sugary beverages. In fact, Coca-Cola shares have rallied an amazing 20% since March's low, overcoming its February stumble with relative ease.The sheer speed and span of the move in an environment that doesn't favor most of the company's fare, however, has left KO stock vulnerable to some profit-taking. One more technical misstep could push Coca-Cola shares over that edge.  *   Click to EnlargeThe &quot;edge&quot; in question is the straight-line support that connects the bulk of the lows seen since March's pivot. It's plotted as a dashed blue line on both stock charts.  * KO shares are no stranger to big swings. In fact, they make them on a rather reliable basis. All of the recent cases where the weekly chart's RSI line entered overbought territory led to major setbacks.  * Although up for the past couple of months, take note of the fact that there's been more bearish volume than bullish volume.  * The purple 50-day moving average line may also be a make-or-break support level at this time. It has been in the past. Southwest Airlines (LUV)Airline stocks are inherently erratic, impacted not just by the ebb and flow of demand for travel, but by the ebb and flow of oil prices. The two differing factors don't always behave with respect to one another as one might expect. Southwest Airlines has been no exception to this norm.There has been a method to the madness though. LUV stock has hammered out the formation of a familiar and telling shape. And, it has done so with a fairly predictable context that implies a breakout thrust could be brewing.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip   *   Click to EnlargeThe bigger-picture pattern is a converging wedge shape, marked in blue lines on both stock charts. The lower edge of the wedge patterns, as can only be seen on the weekly chart, extends all the way back to 2015.  * There's also something important but easy to overlook in the moving average lines plotted on both stock charts. They're all essentially converged now, setting the stage for a divergence from this point forward.  * Tilting the scales in a bullish direction is the high-volume gains that started to materialize last week, and the subsequent push above a not entirely perfect upper boundary of the wedge shape. Visa (V)Finally, Visa has dished out some unexpectedly lengthy and sizable rallies since the beginning of 2017. In fact, the only real rough patch was the weakness most other stocks suffered in the final quarter of last year. And even then, V stock snapped back to an even stronger rally.As could be expected though, the weight of that eight-month gain is starting to prove unbearable. Visa shares have been hit hard a couple of times since last month, and while the advance hasn't been shattered yet, it's nearing that point.  *   Click to EnlargeThe weekly chart puts things in perspective. Last week's high had V shares more than 17% above the 200-day moving average line marked in white on both stock charts. That's the biggest divergence in years.  * The line in the sand, so to speak, is the 100-day moving average line marked in gray.  * Possible landing points include the $156.70 area marked in yellow on the daily chart, where V shares found support a couple of times in May, and then the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line at $162.16, marked on the weekly chart.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-17,"The negative reputation of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) looks increasingly likely to stifle its efforts to build out the Libra cryptocurrency. Despite having a 28-company consortium behind it and Facebook's efforts to reassure governments that its mobile money complies with regulations, resistance to FB's involvement seems to be hardening.Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Facebook has created a $533 billion market cap in 15 years, compared to the $378 billion JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) created in 150 years. FB built its market cap on a network of cloud data centers and free consumer services.A joint statement from French and German regulators seems unequivocal. &quot;We believe that no private entity can claim monetary power, which is inherent to the sovereignty of Nations,&quot; representatives from the two nations wrote. European governments say they want a stable cryptocurrency, but only a cryptocurrency that they control.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Is Facebook's Libra a Threat to Banking?The Libra Association consists of 28 founding members, including Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Those three companies alone have a market cap of over $800 billion. Visa, like Facebook, is worth more than JPMorgan Chase. Payments, traditionally the job of banks, already circulate through dedicated payment networks.In theory, Libra is just a cheaper way of processing transactions. Libra coins would be tied to existing currencies and processed like credit card transactions. But transaction details wouldn't enter the world of &quot;real money,&quot; so merchant fees would be eliminated.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip The problem is that Calibra, a unit of Facebook, would handle the wallets. This seems to be behind government rejection of Libra. Regulators fear that the popularity of Facebook services, which already reach nearly two billion people, would allow it to create its own banking system. U.S. regulators also fear that Libra could be used by terrorists or as a money laundering instrument.Banks, strictly regulated by governments, are not part of the Libra group or process. JPMorgan Chase has its own coin, dubbed JPM Coin, and customer trials are underway. Big traders are getting the benefits of stable coins. Small merchants and consumers are not.Government resistance is spooking some Libra backers, who are thinking of walking away. Facebook, meanwhile, is tired of being the only company sticking its neck out. The Payment World TurnsMeanwhile, the payment world continues to turn.Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent Holding (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) already have cost-effective, chat-based payment systems. India's Unified Payments Interface is increasingly popular. Indian mobile wallets, some backed by Alibaba, are accepted by African merchants. European banks are working with these African payment networks rather than rejecting them.Other cryptocurrencies are jumping into the payments space, claiming to be Libra's competitors. None are likely to gain traction, because they lack market penetration. But they could serve as guinea pigs for banks that want to operate cryptocurrency. One, or several, might then be acquired by banks or other payment processors and slowly scaled to compete. The Bottom Line on FB Stock and LibraTransaction processing systems have a First World problem. Their costs are only acceptable in the First World.Many nations can't afford the fees that Visa and Mastercard charge through local banks. Facebook promised such a mechanism to avoid high fees. Facebook has a global, scaled, cloud-based data network on which low-cost transaction processing services could ride. This would in theory allow Visa and MasterCard to compete with the Chinese and Indian payment groups.But Facebook's leadership of Libra frightens governments. Nations see Facebook as a threat to government sovereignty in a way that Visa and Mastercard are not.Before Libra can get going, Facebook may have to take a back seat in its own invention.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-09-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google plans several big moves into digital payments in India, a country with a huge first-time internet user population that serves as a test-bed for innovations in smartphone technology.The U.S. search giant will start a service called Spot it hopes will get more merchants to adopt online payments, helping early partners including MakeMyTrip, home services marketplace UrbanClap and food delivery brand Oven Story set up branded shops using Google Pay. It’s also pushing digital tokens for mobile commerce, a feature the company will roll out with Visa Inc. for several Indian banks in the coming months, Google executives said.The effort is part of Google’s broader push into one of the world’s fastest-growing internet arenas. The Mountain View, California-based company will also open a research lab focusing on artificial intelligence applications in fields like health care and education, and it’ll offer public Wi-Fi to villages in three regions. Google will take any lessons learned in India to the more than two dozen countries where it offers digital payments.“When you build for India, you are building for the world,” Google Pay’s India head, Ambarish Kenghe, said in a phone interview ahead of a “Google for India” event in New Delhi on Thursday.Google’s commitment is to make the internet accessible and inclusive, said Caesar Sengupta, vice president of the company’s Next Billion Users Initiative and Payments. Aside from voice searches in Hindi, the Google Assistant will soon support eight more local languages. Translations will be added in the coming months. And Google’s speech-based Bolo app, intended to help children read, will also be available in five additional Indian languages with expanded content.Read more: Facebook and Google Chase a New $1 Trillion Payments MarketBut it’s in Indian payments that Google is making the biggest splash, joining other foreign players such as Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp and local firms like Paytm in Asia’s No. 3 economy. Google Pay has grown threefold there over the past 12 months and now has 67 million monthly active users who made transactions worth over $110 billion during the period, Kenghe said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been a big proponent of mobile technology as a way to connect the hundreds of millions of mostly rural residents and merchants underserved by a rickety traditional bank and credit card infrastructure. Google Pay for Business, a new app launching in India, is designed to ease India’s 60 million small businesses into the online commerce realm, letting them experiment with newfangled features such as video verification, Kenghe said.Credit Suisse estimates that the Indian digital payments market will touch $1 trillion by 2023 from about $200 billion currently. Cash still accounts for 70% of all Indian transactions by value, according to Credit Suisse’s analysts, and neighboring China is far more advanced with a mobile payments market worth more than $5 trillion already. That leaves room to grow.“The speed of adoption and growth has defied our expectations,” Sengupta said. “Our product is getting better every two weeks, backed by field researchers observing people in real-life environments in their homes and shops,” he said. “We will keep refining to ensure it’s the right product and service.”(Updates with executive’s comments from the sixth paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Saritha Rai in Bangalore at srai33@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Google Expands Digital Payments Push in India

The travel app is targeting many users across the Indonesian archipelago who have little or no access to traditional banking or reliable internet.Founded by three engineers in 2012, Traveloka -- said to be valued at around $2 billion in 2017 -- has expanded across Southeast Asia by making it easier for consumers to book flights and hotels within the region. It’s raised at least $500 million from investors including Hillhouse Capital and Sequoia. Henry Hendrawan, president of Traveloka operations, said the card was one facet of building a fintech business to complement its travel, accommodation and lifestyle services.“In anything we do in financial services, we will always look to go with strong partners,” Hendrawan said in an interview, adding that he expects to unveil more products and partners in the near future. “This is a perfect example.”With a population of more than 620 million and growing middle class, Southeast Asia is expected to see its online travel market almost triple from about $30 billion in 2018 to $78 billion in 2025, according to Google and Temasek Holdings Pte.

2019-09-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. is negotiating with a key congressional committee for Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to testify as soon as next month, people familiar with the talks said, amid questions about the social media giant’s market power and its plans for a digital cryptocurrency called Libra.Sandberg is expected to appear at a hearing as soon as late October, but officials are still negotiating the details with the House Financial Services Committee, the people said. It’s possible the hearing could slip to later in the year, one of the people said.Sandberg’s appearance would follow July hearings with Facebook executive and Libra co-creator David Marcus, who faced sharp questions from House and Senate panels on whether Facebook could be trusted to create a cryptocurrency and whether Libra might be used for nefarious purposes. The discussions are taking place as the social media giant is facing questions about its market power and its plans for a digital cryptocurrency called Libra.Facebook declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the House Financial Services Committee didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook announced in June it’s trying to create a new cryptocurrency using similar technology to that of Bitcoin, saying it would lower the cost of payments and money transfers. The company helped form a new organization, called the Libra Association, that’s incorporated in Switzerland and would manage the currency. While Facebook would be a member of the association, it said it will have no more power over decisions regarding the currency than other companies and nonprofits that join. So far, the association has 27 other intended members, including Visa Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.Blowback to the plan was swift. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Libra could pose a risk to the financial system. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said the company should immediately stop work on the currency. The French and German finance ministers said they would block the project.The project has even faced criticism from proponents of other cryptocurrencies, who don’t believe Libra’s centralized control make it a fair comparison to decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.During a visit to Washington earlier this month, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg at a dinner promised senators that the currency wouldn’t launch without U.S. regulatory approval.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.net;Elizabeth Dexheimer in Washington at edexheimer@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Sara Forden, Jon MorganFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook in Talks for Sandberg to Testify to House Next Month

2019-10-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Four payments companies that have joined Facebook Inc. as founding members of the Libra Association are wavering over whether to officially sign on to the cryptocurrency project, according to people familiar with the matter.Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and Stripe Inc. are undecided about formally signing onto Libra’s organizing charter because they’re concerned about maintaining positive relationships with regulators who have reservations about the project, the people said.Executives at the payments companies believe Facebook oversold the extent to which regulators were comfortable with the project and are concerned about the perception the social network hasn’t behaved responsibly in other areas -- such as how it has handled user data and privacy, the people said.The Libra Association is asking the 28 founding members to reaffirm their commitment to the cryptocurrency project later this month, according to three people familiar with the matter. Before Libra was unveiled, the companies signed nonbinding letters of intent to explore joining the association.David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the Libra effort, tweeted Wednesday that the “[first] wave of Libra Association members will be formalized in the weeks to come.” Marcus said he was unaware of any current Libra partners who might abstain from officially joining the organization, but building a new global currency is “hard and requires courage.”“I can tell you that we’re very calmly, and confidently working through the legitimate concerns that Libra has raised by bringing conversations about the value of digital currencies to the forefront,“ he added.Companies that officially join the charter won’t be obligated to immediately contribute an initial $10 million required to invest in the project, according to two of the people. The option to delay the payment reflects the association’s strategy to move the Libra project forward in baby steps, the people said. That would give members more time to work out how their participation might affect the rest of their companies’ operations and regulatory obligations, they said.The signing of the charter could take place as soon as Oct. 14, three people said, and will likely happen in Switzerland, where the nonprofit organization charged with managing the Libra digital currency reserve and global payments network would be headquartered.“Nothing has changed with our involvement with Libra since we came on to participate,” said a Stripe spokesman. “We agreed to work on the charter with these other participants. We continue to work on the charter. We’re still actively involved.” He declined to comment specifically on whether Stripe has hesitations about signing the charter.Spokesmen for Facebook, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and the Libra Association declined to comment.The move to get Libra members to formally sign on is the latest indication that Facebook and its partners are pushing forward with the controversial plan, even after it came under fire from policy makers around the world.Facebook has said repeatedly that the Libra Association will be responsible for making decisions about the currency, so its formal creation could mean that regulators start to get better answers than Facebook has offered so far.Some European finance ministers have threatened to ban Libra in their respective countries and the European Union’s antitrust chief says she’s taken the unusual step of scrutinizing Libra because of the risk it could lead to the creation of a new, entirely separate economy.Meanwhile, development of the technology to underpin Libra is moving faster than internal deadlines, Diogo Monica, co-founder of Anchorage, a technology company that safeguards cryptocurrencies, said in a phone interview. Five association members including Anchorage and Facebook’s digital wallet subsidiary Calibra are already running a test network of nodes, and sending transactions -- not done with real money for now -- to each other, he said.Libra has started addressing regulators’ concerns by making tweaks to its technology and policies, such as its anti-money-laundering policies, Monica added. Hundreds of organizations are on a waiting list hoping to join the association, Monica said, but no additional members have been admitted yet, he said.Opponents of the plan say Libra, which would be backed by a pool of traditional currencies, could undercut countries’ monetary policies or be used for nefarious purposes. U.S. lawmakers this summer grilled Marcus, questioning whether Facebook could be trusted to expand into financial services. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg last month told senators that the currency wouldn’t launch anywhere in the world without U.S. regulators’ blessing.Facebook announced the project in June to make international payments as simple as texting. It draws on big names in the payments, technology, telecom and blockchain industries, including EBay Inc., Uber Technologies Inc., blockchain startups Coinbase Inc. and Xapo Inc., and Vodafone Group Plc, as well as venture capital companies and non-profit organizations.Why Everybody (Almost) Hates Facebook’s Digital Coin: QuickTakeEven as Facebook has publicly drawn fire, the Libra organization’s members have worked in the background to hash out details of a chartering document to formally establish the non-profit so that the group’s work to stand up the payments system can move forward.The work has proven contentious due to continued uncertainty about the regulatory implications of the project, according to two of the people.“Since June the Association has met with numerous regulators and policy makers,” said Dante Disparte, a spokesman for the Libra Association, in an email. “Additionally the group of founding members have held regular meetings to discuss appropriate regulatory requirements for operating a payment system, as well as conforming to anti-money laundering, combating the financing of terrorism, privacy and other standards.”(Updates with comment from the Libra Association in the last paragraph.)&#92;--With assistance from Olga Kharif and Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Lydia Beyoud in Arlington at lbeyoud2@bloomberg.net;Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Mark Niquette, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Libra Payments Partners Waver on Cryptocurrency

2019-10-08,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc.’s decision to pull out of the Libra Association may lead to more congressional hearings from critics seeking to press the payments company for more details on why it walked away, according to Cowen.A push for hearings may intensify further if Libra -- Facebook Inc.’s effort to develop a digital currency -- were to lose other members, analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote. Not only has Facebook failed to win Washington’s “buy in,” it’s also lost support and the “messaging war,” he said. And Seiberg warned that other backers may join PayPal in retreating rather than “risk getting pulled into the policy fights over privacy and private currencies.”PayPal pared losses of as much as 2% as Facebook declined as much as much as 1.1%. Meanwhile other Libra backers -- Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. -- both fell more than 1.7% before paring some of the drop. Financials declined across the board, along with the broader market, as analysts fretted about banks’ prospects and trade tensions flared.On Monday, Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette described PayPal’s decision as wise. “While we believe it made sense for PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard to initially participate in Libra to defend their flanks and maintain optionality, the amount of political attention Libra has received has made the opportunity less attractive,” Faucette wrote.Cowen’s Seiberg has consistently doubted Facebook’s ability to secure the necessary regulatory approvals as the social media company is “framing Libra as an independent entity that will control the transaction data of users.” Big partners exiting may mean it will be “harder to convince policymakers that Libra is independent of Facebook.” He expects Facebook will stay in the spotlight and will face mounting scrutiny as the 2020 election approaches.Separately, Height Capital Markets in a note said that “one withdrawal does not doom Libra, but if there is a cascade of departures the Libra project may collapse before it can launch.” The firm also saw regulators’ focus on financial stability as “overstated,” as Libra won’t be issuing any country’s currency or debt, but will convert a given currency into Libra currency, and Libra will be “backed by a basket of short term debt instruments issued by sovereign nations.”Earlier, Loop Capital analyst Alan Gould wrote that Libra “will likely take much longer than initially anticipated” and more government regulation and fines could be on the way.&#92;--With assistance from Cristin Flanagan.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Will DaleyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal’s Exit From Libra May Trigger Fresh Hearings, Cowen Says"

2019-10-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Two Senate Democrats are urging three payment processing companies to reconsider their involvement with the Libra cryptocurrency project envisioned by Facebook Inc. and a coalition of other groups.Libra poses risks not only to global financial systems, but also to the companies’ broader payments business, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said in letter on Tuesday to Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and Stripe Inc.In the letter, the lawmakers cited news reports on the difficulty some of Libra Association members have faced in obtaining details on the organization’s management and risks.The association is composed of a group of 27 members including Facebook and the payments companies, as well as a swath of tech companies like Uber Technologies Inc., telecom providers Iliad SA and Vodafone Group Plc, and cryptocurrency companies like Coinbase, Inc.PayPal, Inc., one of the original members, confirmed it had left the organization on Oct. 4.In a statement, Brown, the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee, and Schatz, a panel member, said they pointed out in the letter that “Congress, financial regulators, and potential Libra Association member companies have struggled to get sufficient details from Facebook about risks that Libra may pose, including facilitating criminal and terrorist financing, destabilizing the global financial system, interfering with monetary policy, or exposing consumers to risks currently limited to accredited investors.”“We urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding, given that Facebook has not yet demonstrated to Congress, financial regulators — and perhaps not even to your companies — that it is taking these risks seriously,” they said in the letter.“Facebook,” the senators added, “is currently struggling to tackle massive issues, such as privacy violations, disinformation, election interference, discrimination, and fraud, and it has not demonstrated an ability to bring those failures under control.”“You should be concerned,” Brown and Schatz said, “that any weaknesses in Facebook’s risk management systems will become weaknesses in your systems that you may not be able to effectively mitigate.”Spokesmen for Mastercard, Visa and Stripe declined to comment. Facebook referred a request for comment to the Libra Association.“The Libra Association maintains its commitment to not launch until questions and concerns by regulators are addressed,” Libra Association spokesman Dante Disparte said in a statement. “This is enshrined in our long launch runway, which has helped inform regulators, policy makers and other stakeholders around the world about our commitment to responsible financial innovation and strong oversight.”Disparte said more than 1,500 organizations have reached out to the association about joining.In July, both Republican and Democratic senators had pointed questions for Facebook at a Banking Committee hearing over its digital currency plans.

2019-10-11,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s effort to create a cryptocurrency was dealt a blow on Friday after several key partners, including Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc., EBay Inc., Stripe Inc. and Mercado Pago, abandoned the project. The defections followed fierce criticism from global regulators and lawmakers, and have prompted some industry-watchers to question whether the Libra program can survive.The news comes days before the Libra Association, the group that will oversee the digital currency, prepares to convene its members and ask them to sign a charter agreement. The meeting is slated to take place on Monday in Geneva. A Libra Association spokeswoman said on Friday that the gathering will proceed as planned, and that it would announce the first list of official partners once a formal charter is signed.In a statement, the spokeswoman said the group was &quot;focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association&quot; as it worked to create &quot;a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people.&quot;When Facebook launched plans for Libra in June, a critical part of its pitch was that major players in the payments and tech industry were supporting it. The cryptocurrency would be run out of Geneva by the organizations that comprised the Libra Association, not solely by Facebook. But now that that alliance appears to be eroding, the project’s future is uncertain.&quot;I don’t think Facebook can do this by itself,&quot; said Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities told Bloomberg TV. &quot;Short of a big bank stepping in like JPMorgan, I don’t think this could ever happen.&quot;In a tweet on Friday, David Marcus, the Facebook executive spearheading the effort, said that the exit of six partners would not derail the effort. &quot;I would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you’re on to something when this much pressure builds up.&quot;Whether or not Libra implodes, the exits highlight the extreme challenges that lie ahead for the project, which if successful could have a sweeping impact on the global financial system. &quot;It may very well fail completely,&quot; said Lisa Ellis, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. Even if it survives, progress will take much longer and &quot;it’s likely to fall into some level of obscurity,&quot; she added.Facebook has faced fierce backlash since the company announced plans for Libra. Politicians and regulators around the world have called on Facebook to halt its progress, and some have suggested Libra could be used for illegal money laundering or trafficking schemes.Despite the scrutiny from public officials and the exodus of partners, Facebook remains committed to Libra, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Some people inside the company think the defections are partly driven by established payments providers worrying about a new entrant encroaching on their turf, the person said.In the months since its announcement, Facebook has frequently found itself in the spotlight over the cryptocurrency. Marcus went to Washington in July to testify before Congress about Facebook’s plans. Later this month, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear before the House Financial Services Committee to answer even more questions about Libra.Earlier this week, two U.S. senators cautioned Visa, Mastercard and Stripe to reconsider their involvement in the project. Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Brian Schatz of Hawaii said that Libra poses a risk to not only the financial system, but the payments companies’ broader business. &quot;We urge you to carefully consider how your companies will manage these risks before proceeding,&quot; they said a letter to the companies.Mastercard said in a statement that it will &quot;remain focused on our strategy and our own significant efforts to enable financial inclusion around the world,&quot; adding, &quot;We believe there are potential benefits in such initiatives and will continue to monitor the Libra effort.&quot; Visa said the company would also continue to evaluate whether to join in Libra in the future, and that the company’s &quot;ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association’s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.&quot;In a statement on Friday, EBay expressed its support for the project, but said it would focus on rolling out its own payments products. “We highly respect the vision of the Libra Association; however, eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member,” an EBay spokesman wrote in the emailed statement. “At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBay’s managed payments experience for our customers.&quot;Payments giant Stripe, one of the most high-profile startups to sign onto the project, signaled it remained open to working on it in the future. “Stripe is supportive of projects that aim to make online commerce more accessible for people around the world. Libra has this potential,” said a company spokesperson. “We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.”The Libra Association is composed of about two dozen organizations, including Facebook. A Lyft Inc. spokeswoman confirmed on Friday that the ride-hailing company remains a member. Other companies that have not signaled plans to leave include Uber Technologies Inc., Spotify Technology S.A., Coinbase Inc. and telecom providers Iliad SA and Vodafone Group Plc. PayPal Holdings Inc. dropped out last week.

In fact, this year SQ stock is only up 10% while Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NASDAQ:MA) are up more than three times as much.Source: Shutterstock This year SQ stock hit heavy resistance at $83 per share and has failed at every potential breakout there. Although SQ is also lagging the S&P 500 by 40%, the opportunity from here is that there is more upside potential than downside risk.Finding bottoms in stocks is tricky. But identifying support zones that could act as a baseline for rallies is a lot easier. Square stock has fallen into such zones. Being around $50 per share has been pivotal to SQ for the last five years. So the bulls in it are on solid footing, which usually makes the case for more upside. There are no weak hands left to hold the stock after a long time of selling pressure.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Super Boring Stocks to Buy With Super Safe Returns Fundamentally, and even after this big correction, SQ stock is still not cheap. It still loses money and it sells at eight times sales. From that perspective it could have a lot more froth to shed. The bullish thesis for SQ has to include the assumption of strong growth. Otherwise it won't deserve its valuation premium and it would have to reprice lower. SQ Stock Has a Good Base for a BounceTechnically the short-term SQ charts show clear lines to trade. Short term, SQ has an opportunity just above $63 per share. This could invite momentum buyers to target $68. But from there, SQ might get a few more optimistic buyers to try and fill the giant gap from the last earnings report. It won't be easy, but if the overall markets rally for any reason then SQ will likely have a realistic chance to do it. But as with any good trade, there needs to be proper stops. In this case, SQ needs to sustain the high-low trend to retain the upside momentum.As with many investments, the whole globe is migrating all financial transaction to digital. The fin-tech sector stocks will have strong demand on their products and services for years to come. SQ, V, and MA will be amidst the winners. Their management teams have so far executed well on plans so I expect them to continue.The bitcoin craze is evidence that the world is ready for electronic financial transactions. Almost everyone I know uses one form of fintech or another. There is definitely room for all major entrants to prosper in it. SQ stock will be higher in the future if the stock markets in general don't crash.This brings up the important points of geopolitical risks that currently plague the headlines. The world seems like it's a mess. But the company P&L's don't indicate an imminent collapse. Politicians will eventually figure things out, but in the meantime they will put investors through a whirlwind of headlines. That's their job so they can justify their existence to their constituents.

2019-10-14,"(Bloomberg) -- The Libra Association hasn’t officially launched but has already lost a quarter of its membership, as Booking Holdings Inc., an online travel company that operates websites including Kayak.com and Priceline.com, joined Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and four other companies in leaving the controversial cryptocurrency project spearheaded by Facebook Inc.With the departure of Norwalk, Connecticut-based Booking, the Libra Association now has 21 founding members remaining of the original 28 companies that signed on to the association in June. PayPal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc., MercadoLibre Inc. and EBay Inc. in the past two weeks have also said they would abandon the project.The remaining members of the Libra Association, a nonprofit that would manage the cryptocurrency, planned to meet Monday in Geneva, Switzerland to finalize its governing charter and initial membership.Libra came under intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators as soon as Facebook announced the project. Regulators warned that the cryptocurrency, originally set to launch next year, could be used by criminals if not properly monitored, while lawmakers pilloried Facebook’s track record at hearings in July with Libra co-founder David Marcus.Officials in some countries, including Germany and France, announced that they would ban Libra, saying that the currency could be a threat to monetary policy, among other concerns.Visa, Mastercard and Stripe left the project shortly after receiving a letter from Democratic senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, warning that they could face increased scrutiny if they stayed on board.Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Libra-member Coinbase Inc., on Sunday said the pressure felt “un-American.” “Why the need for the intimidation tactics? This would be called anti-competitive/monopolistic behavior if any private company did it,” Armstrong wrote on Twitter.In the face of the departures, Libra has said more than 1,500 companies have expressed interest in joining the association and that the currency wouldn’t launch until it satisfied regulators’ concerns.Developers have continued to advance the open-source code that would underlie Libra. However, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal could have provided critical experience in navigating U.S. financial regulators’ concerns, making their departures particularly painful. Booking Holdings, which has a market capitalization of more than $84 billion, was among the only remaining large, publicly held companies left in the project.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg plans to testify next week at the House Financial Services Committee on Libra, among other topics.Representatives for the Libra Association didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&#92;--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Light in Washington at jlight8@bloomberg.net;Olivia Carville in New York at ocarville1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Libra Loses a Quarter of Its Members as Booking Holdings Exits

2019-10-15,"(Bloomberg) -- The Facebook Inc. executive responsible for the embattled Libra cryptocurrency said he doesn’t fault companies that pulled out of the project, adding that he’s optimistic more organizations will sign on despite intense opposition from politicians who seem to fear financial innovation.“I totally respect the fact that those businesses and those leaders have a responsibility to their shareholders, employees and stakeholders,” Facebook’s David Marcus said in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg Television. “We are going to move forward. We are going to add more members.”Facebook suffered a setback in recent days when a quarter of the membership of Libra’s governing body, the Libra Association, defected from the effort amid pushback from regulators and lawmakers. Among those who stepped away are some of the association’s most high-profile names, including Visa Inc., Stripe Inc. and Mastercard Inc.Visa, Stripe and Mastercard received letters earlier this month from Democratic U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown and Brian Schatz that urged the companies to “carefully consider” how they would manage potential risks associated with Libra before proceeding with the project. Asked if he thought the letter constituted a threat from the senators to the companies, Marcus responded, &quot;I don’t know, what did it sound like to you?&quot; He added that such correspondence can have a chilling effect.“For these types of letters to be circulated for a thing that is an idea -- a project -- and telling people you should not explore innovation,” that is a concern, Marcus said. “The core of our financial system has not evolved much. Consumers all around the world are paying the price for it,” he added.Facebook announced its Libra plans in June, saying the digital token would give consumers a low-cost way to make payments and transfer money across the globe. Regulators and lawmakers have expressed concerns that the coin would be used to bypass money-laundering rules and might undermine central banks’ control over monetary policy.The Libra Association, which held its first meeting in Geneva this week, has said it has more than enough willing companies waiting in the wings to join the project. There are 1,500 organizations who have expressed interest in signing on, the association said, though so far only 180 of them meet the organization’s criteria.Even if new backers do sign on, Libra is still a long way from reality. Facebook executives and the Libra Association have said they won’t launch the currency until regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere have been appeased.Industry-watchers will soon get a fresh look at lawmakers’ sentiment toward Libra. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is slated to testify before the House Financial Services Committee next week.To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Facebook's Marcus Vows to 'Move Forward' With Libra, Add Members"

2019-10-15,"With Square (NYSE:SQ) stock you're free to believe what both bears and bulls are saying these days. But if you're watching the SQ stock price chart and are agreeable with the company's underlying growth narrative, the argument for a longer-term investment can be made today.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Mobile payments innovator Square stock has its share of fans and foes. Bulls on Wall Street will point to the company's growth prospects as a primary driver for shareholder performance. Most recently, SQ received just that sort of praise from Susquehanna Financial Group.On Friday analyst James Friedman wrote a client note which laid out the case for SQ stock to rally. According to the firm, Square's investments are set to deliver stronger payment growth following August's earnings-driven fallout. Susquehanna went on to raise Square from &quot;neutral&quot; to &quot;positive&quot; and reaffirmed its 12-month price target of $77 a share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSurprisingly, Friday also saw Instinet analyst Bill Carcache take a bearish swipe at Square's future stock performance. Shares of SQ stock were given a &quot;reduce&quot; rating. Acknowledged innovation in the payments space, as well as the belief Square's investments will bear fruit nevertheless took a backseat to valuation concerns. Square's ValuationWere recent price tag worries associated with the company's failure to turn a profit? Maybe. But I wouldn't be too quick to think that's the end all, be all. Investing in SQ stock is about looking ahead, not in the rear-view mirror.  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals SQ sports a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 58.2. It has a lower price-to-sales ratio than industry competition PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or even credit card giant Visa (NYSE:V). And Square has much stronger sales growth -- estimated at 44% over the next five years. I have to give the benefit of the doubt to the bulls.Additionally, companies like Square are known to sandbag guidance after a weak quarter. Because of this, I think an upside surprise might be just around the corner.  SQ Stock Monthly Price ChartStocks are fluid and price patterns change. Some of my prior notes on the provided monthly chart of SQ stock could be viewed as support of this non-contestable point. As investors, the best we can do is take imperfect information and work with it as unbiased as possible. It's no easy task.Right now Square stock is poised to align its price action with the company's superior growth potential. Following SQ's August correction, shares managed to eventually find a bottom in September at the 50% retracement level tied to its lifetime cycle low of $8.42 to cycle high of $101.15.The September price action in SQ stock is forming a monthly hammer candlestick and this time frame's stochastics are meandering in oversold territory. It is very approachable now to buy Square's growth narrative, even though shares are still highly contentious.My suggestion is to buy SQ stock above $64.75. This will allow the monthly candlestick to receive a small bit of extra price confirmation above the September high of $63.98. From there, I'd look to take partial profits near $80 and where shares turned lower in August. Ultimately though, Square looks like the type of core growth investment which can be accumulated on weakness and allowed to run on the upside.

2019-10-15,"Plans for Facebook’s proposed “stablecoin,” Libra, appear to be unraveling.  This is hardly surprising, given growing awareness of Libra’s potential adverse consequences.  If it offers anonymity to its users, Libra will become a platform for tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist finance.","Facebook’s Libra unravels, and for good reason"
2019-10-15,"(Bloomberg) -- The Libra Association, which oversees a controversial cryptocurrency, was officially formed on Tuesday, and its five board members have one thing in common: close relationships with Facebook Inc. and its executives.When Facebook first announced Libra, the company was quick to point out that it wouldn’t be alone in managing such an ambitious endeavor. Instead, it hoped to be one out of as many as 100 companies controlling the new digital coin. But as regulatory pressures have mounted and early partners have been leaving the project in droves, Facebook finds itself resorting to close allies to fill the Libra leadership team.David Marcus, who heads the Facebook team that proposed Libra in the first place, is on the board. Marcus is also an investor in Xapo Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Wences Casares is on Libra’s board as well.Joining them is Katie Haun, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, which was an early investor in Facebook. Another early Facebook backer, Digital Sky Technologies, is part-owned by Naspers, which has majority ownership of the parent company of PayU, the home of another Libra board member, Patrick Ellis.The fifth board member, Matthew Davie of micro-lending service Kiva, also has ties to Facebook. One of Kiva’s board members is John Muller, associate general counsel at Facebook who, like Marcus, hails from PayPal Holdings Inc.“Silicon Valley boards nearly always have these kinds of interconnections,” Aaron Brown, an investor and a writer for Bloomberg Opinion, wrote in an email. “Even someone without formal ties to Facebook will have informal and indirect ones. So no one qualified to be on the board is likely to be fully independent of Facebook. But I don’t see the board as being essentially an independent check on Facebook. I see it as a group of qualified and interested people.”The board members and the Libra Association didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.“Yes, David is a very small investor in Xapo like dozens of other people from Silicon Valley. Yes, Wences and David are both in payments and fintech in Silicon Valley and because of that they have known each other for a few years now,” a spokesperson for Xapo said. “Neither David being a small investor in Xapo nor David and Wences having known each other for a few years compromises Wences’ independence in Libra’s board.”The Libra Association board was formed after high-profile exits by a number of companies, including Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. and PayPal. The exodus followed scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators who have expressed concern about Facebook’s poor track record in protecting user privacy.Facebook has described Libra as a community effort. But the original group of about 28 partners has dwindled to 21 organizations that signed on as members on Tuesday. Facebook’s challenge will be to convince more companies that there is value for them in a project that has the social-media giant firmly in the driving seat, whether it intended that to be the case or not.(Corrects number of original partners in final paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Olga Kharif in Portland at okharif@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Libra Association Board Members Have Ties to Facebook
2019-10-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s just as well that big companies that process and facilitate payments have quit Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, fearing a regulatory backlash. If Facebook really wants to bring financial services to the “unbanked,” it should try doing it on a smaller scale than these companies’ presence promised. And even then, the probability of failure will be high.It’s clear why PayPal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc., eBay Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Visa Inc. have decided not to join the Libra Association, which Facebook has been organizing to run the proposed digital currency. They took seriously the recent warning of Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio that because of their membership, they could “expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities.” The concern is that a cryptocurrency used in conjunction with encrypted messaging could potentially be used in illegal transactions, and anyone involved in creating such an opportunity would be suspect.U.S. regulators are perfectly capable of scuppering major cryptocurrency projects. On Oct. 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had stopped Telegram Group Inc. from distributing digital tokens, so-called Grams, to the investors who contributed $1.7 billion to the creation of the cryptocurrency last year. These include major U.S. venture capital firms such as Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed. The same could easily happen to Libra.That’s the problem with starting so big. Telegram’s token offering was the biggest ever recorded. Facebook made a big announcement on Libra and presented a list of partners that read like a Who’s Who of the payments industry. They envisaged global launches for their cryptocurrencies. Of course regulators and politicians were alarmed.To avoid this kind of outcome, Facebook — whose stated goal with Libra is to offer affordable payment services and loans to people currently priced out of the financial services market — could have tried the strategy that got results for one of its remaining partners, Vodafone Group Plc. Vodafone launched M-Pesa, Kenya’s storied “mobile money,” in 2007, and one of the project’s major assets was the Kenyan central bank’s consent to the launch without any formal regulation. Vodafone’s local cellular operator, Safaricom Plc, quickly built up a network of stores where people without bank accounts could pay in and receive cash, and old-fashioned mobile phones began to double as wallets for transfers and purchases. The lack of regulatory intervention and the large physical network, fed by relatively generous commissions, made sure that by 2019, M-Pesa claimed 37 million active customers in seven African countries. But attempts to transplant the service to many other markets have failed. Vodafone has closed M-Pesa in India (in part because of regulatory obstacles), South Africa (low customer interest), Romania and Albania (apparently it was unprofitable). Vodafone discovered there was no cookie-cutter solution. In different countries, lenders, retailers and mobile operators offered competing services, and regulatory scrutiny varied. To find countries in which to launch such an electronic money service, one would need to go down the list of nations with large populations of the unbanked. The top 20, according to the World Bank, includes big ones, such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil.But in most of these countries, people are already using some form of digital money in lieu of dealing with traditional financial institutions. That’s why the list of 20 countries with the smallest percentage of people who have recently made or received digital payments looks completely different.In other words, it’s not easy to find a country where a lot of people have neither a bank account nor access to other kinds of financial services. And then there’s a chance that the cash-using population of a specific country wants to stay that way. One possible reason M-Pesa didn’t quite work in Albania and Romania is that these countries have large informal economies. With up to a third of gross domestic product “in the shadow,” traceable electronic transactions are unattractive compared with cash. These difficulties of finding good target markets, and ones with friendly regulators to boot, should explain Facebook’s desire to launch at scale, to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. But the risk with this approach is that the idea of offering cheap financial services to the unbanked begins to look like a smokescreen for building a huge unregulated bank in the developed world — just what regulators in Europe and the U.S. fear the most.Instead of pushing ahead with the remaining partners and risking the same kind of trouble as Telegram, Facebook should go back to the drawing board and start thinking of smaller projects tailor-made to specific countries’ requirements. Expansion would be slow, and there would be failures and miscalculations along the way, but regulators in each market might be easier to persuade that the project’s goals aren’t nefarious. To contact the author of this story: Leonid Bershidsky at lbershidsky@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Tobin Harshaw at tharshaw@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Leonid Bershidsky is Bloomberg Opinion's Europe columnist.

2019-10-15,"Since it was spun off from online marketplace eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in July 2015, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has consistently delivered the goods. This year has been no different, with PayPal stock gaining nearly 24% since this January's opening price.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Over the years, I've generally taken a bullish stance on PYPL stock. As a digital-payments processor, PayPal has the distinct advantage of being indefinitely relevant. In recent years, we have witnessed the rise and surging interest in alternative payment vehicles, such as cryptocurrencies. More likely than not, this trend will continue to progress.In addition, this underlining thesis behind PayPal stock aligns naturally with current behavioral trends. According to a Pew Research Center report, &quot;Roughly three-in-ten U.S. adults (29%) say they make no purchases using cash during a typical week, up slightly from 24% in 2015.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInterestingly, Pew noted that as income levels rise, so does eschewing cash for digital payments. Logically, this makes perfect sense. Those with higher income tend to have higher education levels, and therefore have access to new technologies. Given that saving time is more of a concern than saving money for more affluent individuals, they're more willing to advantage digital payment solutions. Naturally, this benefits PYPL stock.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now Not surprisingly, millennials love anything to do with digitalization. Since they represent the largest workforce in the U.S., the compass for PayPal stock is appropriately calibrated.However, what is surprising is that older generations are also embracing the conveniences of digitalization. When I look at PYPL stock from a wide angle, the increasing adoption of alternative payments is what keeps me bullish.That said, the third-quarter PayPal earnings report is around the corner, and that's not necessarily great news. Management Must Control the Narrative of the PayPal Earnings ReportOn paper, the upcoming PayPal earnings report - scheduled for release after the close on Oct. 23 - should result in a per-share profitability beat. Going back to Q1 2016, the company at worst has met expectations for earnings per share.This time around, covering analysts expect EPS to come in at 67 cents. This is firmly near the upper end of the estimate spectrum, which ranges from 52 cents to 71 cents. In the year-ago quarter, PYPL delivered an EPS of 58 cents. A 15.5% earnings lift year-over-year is well within reason relative to prior performances.On the revenue front, consensus forecast pegs sales at $4.4 billion. As with earnings, analysts are incredibly optimistic for growth, with revenue estimates ranging from $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion.But does all this mean that PayPal stock is an easy buy? Unfortunately, recent news items make the narrative severely complicated.In a much-publicized fallout, PayPal dropped out of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Libra cryptocurrency project. Later, eBay, Stripe, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and Mercado Pago followed suit.Also, in late September, PayPal announced Chinese government approval to buy a controlling stake in Gopay Information Technology. This groundbreaking event marks the first time a foreign entity has entered China's payment services market.But most critically, PayPal lost $228 million in Q3 because of its investment in Uber (NYSE:UBER), which has been nothing short of volatile.Optically, these news items give the impression that PayPal is biting off more than it can chew. Plus, with its Uber losses, PYPL confirms that some of their bets probably won't pan out for some time. Therefore, the PayPal earnings report in Q3 will be about more than the numbers; investors will look to management to re-instill confidence in a suddenly shaky organization. It's Time to Play the Tactical Game with PayPal StockDespite my belief in the longer-term picture for PYPL stock, I've got to look at reality. For the immediate time frame, the markets are bearish on shares. In this situation, the last thing I want to do is fight the tape.Technically, PayPal stock has dropped below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (DMAs), barometers for nearer-term and longer-term sentiment, respectively. I also believe it's an important clue that the price action has stumbled at the 50 DMA in the past two months. Upside resistance is strong, which implies a future downward trajectory.But even if PayPal stock absorbs a rough outing following Q3, I won't take that as a net negative. Instead, it provides a &quot;time capsule&quot; opportunity for those who wanted to jump aboard but didn't for whatever reason. Although the nearer-term picture is troublesome, the forward outlook is among the brightest in the tech space.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-17,"Square (NYSE:SQ), the mobile payment fintech (financial technology) company, is expected to report earnings on Nov. 6. In recent years, &quot;fintech&quot; has become one of the most popular buzzwords in the markets. Although it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses and individual clients.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com In 2019, SQ stock is up about 14%, but lately has taken a beating. Square shareholders are now wondering if they should consider buying the stock prior to the earnings release.I do not think long-term investors should rush to buy into the shares just yet. When SQ stock reports earnings in a few weeks, Wall Street will be able to better gauge the financial health of the company. Here is why:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Can SQ Stock Shake Off Earnings Season Jitters?On Aug. 1, the payment-solutions company reported Q2 earnings that were better-than-expected. Its total net revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion. And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street's expectation of 17 cents per share.Its payments processing business, also referred to as &quot;payments as a service,&quot; has been a game changer in serving small businesses. Square's subscription and services-based revenue increased 87% to $251 million. Primary drivers behind the growth include the Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Deposit. Cash App's quarterly revenue of $135 million especially impressed the Street.Gross payment volume (GPV) of $26.8 billion increased from $21.4 billion year-over-year. Square defines GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square, net of refunds.The quarterly report once again confirmed that SQ stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company's lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Its Q3 adjusted-EPS guidance of 18 cents to 20 cents trailed the average estimate of 22 cents. Square management now expects Q3 adjusted revenue to be between $590 million and $600 million as opposed to the consensus of $599 million.Square stock's losses on the bottom line are also projected to be higher than expected. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide. Square Is a Growth Stock in a Competitive IndustryAccording to a recent World Bank research paper by Juan Cortina and Sergio Schmukler, &quot;… the trend toward digitalization and technological innovation will likely reshape the global financial sector and the ways in which financial companies interact with their customers.&quot;Square's rather sticky ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. Through various growth initiatives, management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the fintech sphere.The global payments industry is a $100 trillion-plus market. Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. SQ stock faces competition from many companies, including the global online payments group Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), transaction processing leader Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), which is shaping up to become a global payments giant as well.A growth stock like Square trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street has questions as to whether the group can maintain growth quarter after quarter. If the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly. Therefore, throughout the year, the SQ stock price has been extremely volatile.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.Efforts to attain profitability are taking time. Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits. And unless it increases its revenue, Wall Street may take down the high valuation of SQ stock. Square Stock's Rich ValuationFollowing the initial public offering of Square stock in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018. Yet over the past year, SQ stockholders have noticed a decline in the growth rate of its gross payment volume. Between July 2017 and the end of June 2018, GPV grew about 30%. Now growth hovers around 25%. Wall Street tracks this metric widely.As growth has declined, so has the share price. Now the shares are hovering around $64. Although the decline in Square's stock has improved its valuation, the shares are still richly valued.Most SQ stock holders are well aware that the shares do not trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios, especially compared to its competitors. For example, SQ's forward price-to-earnings ratio is over 56. On the other hand, forward P/E ratios for PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about 29.5, 28.5 and 25.7 respectively.Similarly Square stock's current price-to-sales ratio is over 6.9x. Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective, S&P 500's average price-to-sales ratio is 2.1x.In short, I do not think there is much room for Square stock's valuation to head higher in the final quarter of the year. Sooner or later, SQ stock's valuation and revenue growth will be more in balance. Technical Charts for SQ Signal More VolatilityLet us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the past year.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. However, it had a rough patch after reaching the all-time high in October. By late-December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 15%, August has seen the start of a downtrend in the stock. That's of course due to the weak Q3 guidance.Before this, shares had been up over 45% for the year ahead of the Q2 quarterly results release. On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. By Sept. 24, the stock saw a low of $54.41.From a technical perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up prior to the earnings report. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be range-bound between $60 and $65, a range where SQ stock has strong support. However, if any negative headlines flash that affect the technology or fintech sectors, then shares may easily go below $60.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing shares at this point, especially prior to the earnings report. The Bottom Line on Square StockThe so-called fintech revolution is changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers. Square is providing merchants with a wide range of tools and services to start, run, and grow their businesses.Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against Square stock. In the short-term, though, stakeholders shouldn't expect smooth sailing.Square is a high beta stock at 3.3. The stock market has a beta of 1. SQ stock's beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, Square stock rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling. Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock's wide daily swings.The upside momentum can build up only when long-term investors feel that the SQ stock price justifies the future growth expectations. Thus Wall Street would want to see the next quarterly results to judge whether the current investor skepticism is warranted.Analysts are likely to pay special attention to metrics that would indicate Square stock's potential to continue growing sales and earnings over the next several quarters. I personally would not take sides as to whether the share price will go up or down when the group reports earnings soon.Investors with a 2-3 year time horizon may consider any further price decline in Square shares as a good buying opportunity.At the time of writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The New Yorker and the Atlantic have never been known for their business coverage, so when both magazines published long articles about Amazon.com Inc. in their current issues it signaled that something is in the air. That something is antitrust.More precisely, what’s in the air is the question of what the government should do to rein in the tremendous power of the big four tech companies: Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.Once the province of think tanks and law reviews, this topic has become such a public concern that 48 of the 50 state attorneys general are conducting antitrust investigations, presidential hopefuls are calling for tech giants to be broken up, and general interest magazines like, well, the New Yorker and the Atlantic are asking whether the companies abuse their market power. In this particular case, the magazines are asking it about Amazon.The Atlantic article is by Franklin Foer, who has long raised concerns about Big Tech. Five years ago, for instance, he wrote a cover story for the New Republic titled “Amazon Must Be Stopped.” It focused on Amazon’s dominance over the book business.This time around, he is writing about the unbridled ambition of Amazon’s founder and chief executive officer Jeff Bezos. (The new article is “Jeff Bezos’s Master Plan.”) “Bezos’s ventures are by now so large and varied that it is difficult to truly comprehend the nature of his empire, much less the end point of his ambitions,” Foer writes. He then goes through a list. Bezos wants to conquer space with his company Blue Origin. Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post makes him a significant media and political figure. Bezos’s brainchild, Amazon, “is the most awe-inspiring creation in the history of American business.” And so on.He also points out that while critics fear Amazon’s monopoly power, the company is loved by consumers. “A 2018 poll sponsored by Georgetown University and the Knight Foundation found that Amazon engendered greater confidence than virtually any other American institution,” he writes. I have no doubt that this is true; Amazon’s obsession with customer service instills tremendous loyalty among consumers. It’s no accident that over 100 million people now pay the company $119 a year to be Amazon Prime members. That loyalty is also one reason taking antitrust actions against Amazon would be much more difficult than going after Facebook or Google. I’ll get to some other reasons shortly.Charles Duhigg’s New Yorker article “Is Amazon Unstoppable?” is both smarter about Amazon and more pointed about its power. Duhigg captures its relentless culture, comparing it to a flywheel that never stops. He described Bezos’s efforts to ensure that Amazon never loses the feel of a scrappy startup. The phrase that came to mind as I was reading Duhigg’s article was Andy Grove’s famous dictum: “Only the paranoid survive.”Duhigg is also interested in what Amazon’s critics have to say. Amazon pays no U.S. taxes. Amazon’s work culture makes it nearly impossible for women who want children to have long careers there. Amazon’s warehouse workers are sometimes fired after being injured on the job. Amazon looks the other way when counterfeit goods are sold on its site. (In the article, Amazon’s representatives deny these allegations.)Then there’s the fact that Amazon both serves as a platform for companies wanting to sell things and sells things itself. In other words, it competes with the same companies it enables. According to Duhigg, Amazon has been known to track items that do well, and then make its own version of the same item — which it then sells at a discounted price. (Amazon denies this, too.) Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s commissioner for competition, told Duhigg that the practice “deserves much more scrutiny.”The story’s killer anecdote, at least as it concerns antitrust, is about Birkenstock USA LP’s experience with Amazon. Although Birkenstock sold millions of dollars of shoes using the Amazon platform, it was constantly hearing customer complaints that the shoes were defective. Why? Because, according to Birkenstock, Amazon allowed counterfeits to be sold on the site. Not only would Amazon not take down the counterfeit goods, but it also wouldn’t even tell Birkenstock who was selling them.Amazon also had stocked a year’s worth of Birkenstock inventory, which terrified the company. “What if Amazon decides to start selling the shoes for 99 cents, or to give them away with Prime membership, or do a buy-one-get-one-free,” wondered Birkenstock’s chief executive officer, David Kahan. “We were powerless.”Kahan’s complaints went nowhere. So he pulled Birkenstocks off Amazon. What did Amazon do? It solicited Birkenstock retailers, offering to buy shoes directly from them. Today, if you search for Birkenstocks on Amazon you’ll be deluged with choices even though the company itself refuses to do business with Amazon. According to Duhigg, authorized retailers sell the classic Birkenstock Arizona sandal for $135. I found a pair on Amazon for $39.95. Is it the real thing, or is it a counterfeit? Only Amazon knows. Indeed, I could even get the sandals for free if I was approved for an Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card. That is Kahan’s worst nightmare.The hard question: What do you do about this kind of behavior? On one extreme is the Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren, who believes the most appropriate solution is to break up Amazon. At the other end of the spectrum, there are still plenty of antitrust economists who believe that if a $135 sandal is being sold for $39.95, that’s good for consumers. They argue that the government should just stay out of the way.I’m a proponent of breaking up Facebook, mainly because I believe if you force it to disgorge two of its prized platforms, Instagram and WhatsApp, you’ll instantly create serious competitors. That could help raise the bar on privacy, data usage and other concerns. But I’m not sure that would work with Amazon.For instance, if Amazon had to separate its highly profitable cloud service, Amazon Web Services, from its retail business the power dynamic between Amazon and the companies that use its platform would remain.What’s more, it’s harder to make a classic antitrust case against Amazon than it is against Facebook and Google. According to the research firm EMarketer Inc., Amazon is expected to account for 37.7% of all online commerce in 2019. By contrast, Google controls 89% of the search market.Still, for too many retailers, Amazon has the power to control their destiny, for good or ill. As the antitrust activist Lina Khan wrote in her now-famous 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal: “History suggests that allowing a single actor to set the terms of the marketplace, largely unchecked, can pose serious hazards.” I take that assessment to mean that government intervention at Amazon is needed.To my mind, the simplest and most sensible solution is from the economist Hal Singer: Don’t allow platform companies to favor their own products over competitors’ products. Singer calls this a “nondiscrimination regime,” and models it after the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, which prevents cable distributors from favoring their own content over content from competitors. In that scenario, a company that felt it was being discriminated against by Amazon could bring a complaint to federal regulators just as cable stations can do now. This regime has worked well for the TV industry. It could work for Amazon, too.Secondly, the government should hold Amazon accountable for counterfeits. Counterfeiting is against the law, and although Amazon told Duhigg that it spends “hundreds of millions of dollars” on anti-counterfeiting efforts it’s no secret that many deceptively labeled goods are still sold on the site. (See, for instance, this recent Wall Street Journal story.) Companies like Birkenstock have a right to expect that a platform selling its products will rigorously police counterfeits — and will identify counterfeiters so manufacturers of authentic goods can take legal action.These are solvable problems. They don’t require extreme measures. What they do require is a government with the will to transform Amazon’s platform from what it is now, a vehicle that squelches competition, to one that lets competition flower.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Timothy L.

2019-10-23,Bitcoin prices have quietly been in meltdown mode in recent trade and that trend has accelerated amid testimony on Wednesday from Facebook CEO Inc. Mark Zuckerberg as he attempts to make a case for digital-currency payment platform Libra.,Zuckerberg is getting grilled in Washington as bitcoin is getting grilled on Wall Street
2019-10-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg was ready for a Congressional interrogation on Facebook Inc.’s cryptocurrency project. On the stand for more than six hours Wednesday, he got a lashing on every other controversy facing the social media giant, too.The 35-year-old chief executive officer arrived on Capitol Hill prepared to defend the company’s plans for Libra, describing the advantages of a global digital coin that would help open up financial systems to the poor and underbanked around the world. From the start of his testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, however, lawmakers made it clear that beyond the questions they had over the new currency, they are skeptical that Facebook should be trusted with the tremendous power it has amassed over 2.7 billion global users.https://t.co/K2g4PUIriZ— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) October 23, 2019 During the CEO’s lengthy appearance, many of Washington’s grievances about Facebook were laid bare. There were heated questions about Facebook’s refusal to fact-check political ads; accusations of rampant child exploitation on the platform; Facebook’s move to encryption and the impact that would have on the ability to obscure criminals; the company’s continued problems with election interference heading into the 2020 presidential election; what it’s doing to prevent “deepfakes,” or manipulated videos; and critiques of its poor record on workforce diversity.“I think you can appreciate using a person’s past behavior to determine their future behavior,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from New York. “In order for us to make decisions about Libra, we have to dig into Facebook’s past behavior in respect to democracy.” She then dove into a line of questioning about what Zuckerberg knew and when regarding the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal that erupted in 2018.Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters set the tone early on in a tweet she sent just as the hearing got underway.“Facebook has allowed election interference, released private data, violated civil rights laws, among other offenses & now they’re trying to launch a BigTechTakover by creating this mysterious ZuckBuck?”Waters, a California Democrat, said Facebook should stop work on its cryptocurrency project until the company addresses a series of unrelated “deficiencies” in its social-media business.Zuckerberg vowed to try to address lawmakers’ concerns but also said he hoped to “address the risk of not innovating. I don’t know if Libra is going to work, but I believe in trying new things.”He also conceded that it has been “a challenging few years for Facebook.” The company has acknowledged the unauthorized use of private user information by U.K. research firm Cambridge Analytica, shut down several state-backed disinformation campaigns, been targeted with multiple antitrust investigations and been hammered for taking money to publish false political advertising.Facebook has gone to great lengths to try to rehabilitate its image. For years, Zuckerberg had described his social network’s purpose as “connecting the world,” but that mission ended up as a grow-at-all-costs strategy that created blind spots on how the platform could be used in harmful ways, such as live-streaming terrorist shootings and attacks. Zuckerberg last testified to congress in April 2018, answering 10 hours of questions about how Facebook allowed app developers to collect data on users, and how the platform was used by Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election.The company spent a record $4.8 million on lobbying in the third quarter, according to federal disclosures filed Monday, up 70% from the same period a year earlier. Since October 2018, Facebook has hired 12 external lobbying firms to supplement the 11 lobbyists it counts among its own employees, according to the company’s filings. Facebook brought on many of the outside firms to support the launch of Libra.Waters has been one of the loudest critics in Congress of Facebook’s effort to create the Libra digital token. When the social-media giant first announced its plans in June, she almost immediately demanded that the company halt development. Government officials and central bankers in Europe have also raised concerns about how the project would protect users’ privacy and prevent criminals from using it to launder money.Facebook sent David Marcus, the executive who leads the company’s blockchain team and has so far served as the de-facto leader for Libra, to address the same committee in July. He too spent much of his time defending his employer for its previous missteps, and trying to convince Congress that people will be able to use Libra without ever having to use Facebook.Zuckerberg reiterated Wednesday that he has no intention of launching the cryptocurrency without approval from U.S. regulators. That was a point of contention and confusion before the Libra Association was officially formed this month.Though he has made the promise before, Zuckerberg took it a step further on Wednesday, saying that Facebook could even be forced to leave the Libra Association entirely if the group decides to move forward with the currency without approval from U.S. regulators. It’s an unlikely scenario, but Zuckerberg’s suggestion that Facebook could abandon a project it started is meant to appease lawmakers who have pushed back aggressively. Zuckerberg said he wants the project to meet or even exceed U.S. government standards.At the same time, Zuckerberg made the case that if the U.S. doesn’t lead in innovation, specifically in areas like cryptocurrency, then China will leap ahead.“We can’t sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don’t innovate,” he said.But members of Congress poked holes in Zuckerberg’s argument that Libra would improve America’s dominance in finance around the world. If that were the case, why would Libra need a home base in Switzerland, with a global roster of members and need to be backed by multiple currencies beyond the U.S. dollar? How would the currency actually work, and would it allow transactions that were anonymous or non-refundable?Zuckerberg didn’t have many answers. The Libra product is still just an idea, and its launch will require agreements by association members on how it will function and fit within global regulatory frameworks. He said he didn’t know whether other Libra members were planning to contribute money to back the currency, and that the idea of anonymous transactions is still “an open question.”Facebook originally had 27 partners that planned to join it in the Libra Association, which is supposed to share in the governance of the cryptocurrency. Recently about a fourth of those original members dropped out, including PayPal Holdings Inc., Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, said the departure of those members was a disturbing sign. Zuckerberg said some of Libra’s early partners abandoned the project probably because it was risky and because of the intense regulatory scrutiny. Facebook has made an effort to make clear that the social network won’t be solely responsible for managing Libra.Several lawmakers questioned Facebook’s motives for basing the Libra Association in Switzerland instead of in the U.S. A big part of other crypto companies’ decision to set up in the country is the flexible tax treatment they can get. There has also been much clearer regulatory guidance from the Swiss compared to U.S. regulators like the IRS or SEC. And Zuckerberg said he views the financial infrastructure in the U.S. as outdated.Zuckerberg, who has a personal interest in cryptocurrencies, came prepared with lofty arguments about Libra’s purpose: It could help reduce income inequality by giving people -- including 14 million in the U.S. without access to bank accounts -- an easier, faster and cheaper way to send money around the world. At the same time, it would secure America’s international financial leadership, since Libra would be backed mostly by the U.S. dollar, especially if the cryptocurrency is allowed to launch prior to similar planned efforts in China.But lawmakers pushed Facebook to clearly outline the business reasons for the project -- beyond the pitch meant to appeal to regulators. Facebook envisions Libra being incorporated into the company’s various messaging apps including WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The company believes that the currency could help benefit its existing advertising business, or create opportunity for new revenue streams. Zuckerberg said in the hearing that Libra will eventually help boost Facebook’s ad prices, but he later said Libra is more than a business plan and that he’s “certainly not doing this because I am trying to make more money.”At the hearing’s end, there was still no consensus on what lawmakers would need to be comfortable with the project. It’s still unclear what agencies or bodies will regulate Libra and when it will actually launch.Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the committee, said he’s not sure lawmakers learned anything new.“We don’t have a deeper understanding of how Libra would work.”Zuckerberg will have another attempt to clarify when he responds to potentially hundreds of pages of written questions from the legislators.&#92;--With assistance from Joe Light.To contact the reporters on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.net;Sarah Frier in San Francisco at sfrier1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Zuckerberg Gets Thrown a Long List of Grievances by Congress

2019-10-24,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration’s point person for overhauling the federal student loan system abruptly resigned Thursday after calling for the government to wipe out most of the nation’s $1.6 trillion of student debt.A. Wayne Johnson -- a Republican and former financial services executive who U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos had appointed to a series of senior roles -- said that the federal government needs to wipe out the first $50,000 of debt owed for higher education by some 42 million Americans. That would jump-start economic growth by eliminating more than $900 billion of federal student loans -- and completely erase the debt for the vast majority of borrowers, he said.“As a banker, you recognize problematic situations and you deal with it through write-offs,” Johnson, who formerly worked at financial companies including First Data Corp. and Visa Inc., said in an interview. “From an economic standpoint, it is absolutely the right thing to do.”Johnson joins Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both Democratic candidates for president, in demanding mass debt forgiveness, a growing movement fueled by a generation of overburdened Americans who say they paid too much for an education that failed to provide the earnings boost that would justify the cost.Johnson appears to be betting that debt forgiveness will appeal to Republicans too. He’s using the forgiveness plan to launch his candidacy for the seat held by U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican whose retirement at the end of 2019 will give Governor Brian Kemp the power to appoint an interim successor. More than 1.5 million people in the state collectively owe almost $61 billion on their federal student loans, U.S. Education Department data show.Nationwide, a 1% tax on employers’ earnings would provide more than enough funding to cover the government’s debt writedowns -- losses that would result anyhow, Johnson said, because much of the nation’s student loan debt ultimately won’t be repaid.About a fifth of borrowers are in default, Education Department data show, and millions more are behind on their bills. Borrowers as a group are paying down about 1% of their federal debt every year, an earlier Bloomberg Businessweek analysis found -- the equivalent of a former student annually reducing the balance of a typical $30,000 college loan by just $300.Stands OutAs a Republican, and as a former Trump administration official, Johnson stands out from the crowd of Democrats clamoring for debt relief. After a career in financial services, Johnson enrolled in a doctorate program in higher education at Mercer University and wrote his dissertation on student loans. His former boss, DeVos, last week criticized Democratic proposals to cancel debt by arguing it’d be unfair to the millions of Americans who never went to college but ultimately would foot the bill through taxes.Johnson’s plan includes two separate provisions meant to address criticism that it’d be unfair or insufficient. First, Johnson wants the federal government to reimburse past borrowers who’ve already paid off their loans with as much as $50,000 in income tax credits. Second, he’d eliminate the federal loan program and replace it with $50,000 in grants to cover college tuition and work training and licensing programs.It was a chance meeting with a struggling borrower from Utah that prompted Johnson to reconsider the role that student debt plays in people’s lives, he said. The man had never been late on a bill, but his initial $40,000 balance had ballooned to some $120,000 after years of postponing his payments. The borrower asked Johnson if his agency would negotiate a final payment that would allow him to pay less than he owed.“Like millions of Americans, every day he woke up owing more than the day before,” Johnson said. “That’s when I said, ‘This is nuts.’”To contact the reporter on this story: Shahien Nasiripour in New York at snasiripour1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2019-10-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Visa Inc. rose 0.8% in early Friday trading after the company reported earnings and issued forecasts that topped expectations. Analysts used the same phrase -- “better than feared” -- to describe Visa’s results as they’d used to characterize a report by fellow payments company PayPal Holdings Inc. on Thursday.Visa stock rose the most since Feb. 1 on Thursday to close 2.8% higher, while PayPal closed up 8.6% at the highest since Sept. 23. Visa and Mastercard Inc. have outperformed so far this year, with Visa rallying 34% and Mastercard gaining 43%. That compares with a 26% gain for PayPal, and a 20% rise in the S&P 500.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:Morgan Stanley, James FaucetteVisa makes “compounding earnings growth look easy,” Faucette wrote in a note, as it delivered “another quarter of strong double digitrevenue/earnings growth, with 2020 guidance implying more of the same.”Faucette said that investors are “likely to be positively surprised by slightly better cross border and international growth.” He’s “encouraged by progress in longer-term opportunities.” Maintained overweight rating, lifted price target to $207 as valuation was rolled forward to 2021.MoffettNathanson, Lisa Ellis“Visa’s results were about as in line as they could be, which for Visa means really good,” Ellis wrote. She flagged fiscal 2019 revenue growth of 11% and earnings per share growth of 18%, along with forecasts pointing to “more of the same” in 2020.She added that Visa’s “core volume metrics were in-line, if still a bit sluggish.” And most of the call was spent, as usual, she said, on “strategic topics, with a particular focus on Visa’s new offerings.” Rates Visa buy, with a target price of $210.Bernstein, Harshita Rawat“We remain bullish and view Visa (and Mastercard) as a ‘clean’ secular growth story in payments,” Rawat wrote. “Despite investor concerns, macro appears largely stable, and Visa (and Mastercard’s) earnings are somewhat resilient even in a downturn,” while there’s probably upside from compounding earnings-per-share growth.In the quarter, results were largely in line with expectations when adjusted for non-operational items, including accounting, taxes and interest expense, Rawat said. Revenue was also in line when adjusted for accounting, as “modest weakness” in services and other revenue was offset by lower incentives, stronger international transactions, and data processing revenue.Visa’s 2020 forecast was “modestly ahead of buy-side expectations,” she added, noting that the outlook was a key investor focus going into the results as “many investors were cautious on macro and lapping of a strong pricing year.” Rates outperform, price target $200.Jefferies, Trevor WilliamsVisa’s earning-per-share beat was driven by “top-line upside and a lower tax rate,” Williams wrote. Initial 2020 guidance was in-line with Jefferies expectations, and may have been “better than some feared.”“We continue to like the near-term set-up with a 10%-plus discount to Mastercard despite EPS growth converging, full pricing impact in the first half of 2020, FX headwinds easing, and believe Visa Direct can drive upside,” he saidg(Updates share trading in first and second paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven FrommFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Analysts Call Visa Results Better Than Feared, Like PayPal’s"

2019-10-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If someone woke from a coma and saw that the S&P 500 Index was up 21% for the year and reaching a new record high on Monday, the immediate reaction would most likely be that everything is great. But that’s far from true.The list of reasons stocks should be down is much longer than the one for why they should be up. The economy has slowed, and a majority of chief financial officers anticipate a recession within a year. Earnings have stopped growing, and estimates are being cut. Stock valuations are high. The U.S.-China trade war has not been resolved. Congress has started an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy, but that’s only because the outlook has deteriorated.So why are equities roaring ahead? The answer comes down to a handful of stocks: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Oracle Corp. Those five companies account for half of the S&P 500 tech sector, which has surged 30.2% for the year. Exclude that sector and the S&P 500 would be up only about 14%, according to DataTrek Research. That’s still good but nothing special when compared with the returns in the rest of the world, with the MSCI All-Country World Index excluding the U.S. having gained 12%.Therein lies the hidden risk embedded in the market, which is that any missteps by any of these highfliers could spell doom for equities more broadly. It also underscores just how lacking in breadth this latest leg up has been. For one, the percentage of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange closing above their 200-day moving averages has dropped to 53% from 59% in mid-September.Not only that, but the spread between the share of S&P 500 members closing at 52-week highs and the share at 52-week lows has been in a general downtrend since June.To be sure, it’s not unusual that a handful of stocks have led the broader market higher. Before this year, it was the FAANG group of stocks: Facebook Inc., Apple, Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and a few others. A few years ago, AQR Capital Management’s co-founder and chief investment officer, Clifford Asness, published a paper examining the impact of individual stocks on the S&P 500 from 1994 to 2014. What he found was that while the S&P 500 rose 9.3% a year, the top 10 stocks accounted for 4.1 percentage points of that gain on average.Then there’s the awkward fact that smaller stocks that make up the vast majority of the market are down about 11% from their records reached in August 2018 based on the S&P Small Cap 600 and Russell 2000 indexes.This stock market has delivered plenty of surprises, and betting against it has been a losing proposition. In January, when the S&P 500 was trading at about 2,600, the median estimate of about 25 Wall Street strategist surveyed by Bloomberg was for it to end the year at 2,913. It surpassed that level in April and ended Friday at 3,203. But those same strategists are more cautious, predicting the benchmark to drop to 3,000 by the end of the year.Of course, they could raise their forecasts, but that would be awkward given the trend in profits and the slowing economy. Third-quarter earnings are tracking at a 3% decline from a year earlier, and forecasts for the fourth quarter have been cut to a gain of 1.2% from the 5.4% increase that was forecast at the end of July, according to Cantor Fitzgerald. The S&P 500’s price-to-earnings ratio, at just shy of 20 times, is the highest since last October, just as the benchmark was beginning a tumble that led to a 14% drop in the final three months of the year.All that suggests investors need to look beyond the headlines about yet another record.To contact the author of this story: Robert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Robert Burgess is an editor for Bloomberg Opinion.

2019-10-28,"When will the weakness of Square (NYSE:SQ) stock end? Despite a pretty good year for tech stocks, SQ stock has struggled throughout 2019. And lately, things have been going from bad to worse, as Square stock fell below the $60 mark again recently before making a modest recovery.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Analysts have added to the general negativity towards Square stock. More analysts have &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; ratings on SQ stock than &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;outperform&quot; ratings.That's quite rare, particularly for a promising growth company like SQ. However, analysts are frustrated by Square's uneven profit margins and the lack of certainty regarding its income over the next year. That uncertainty is due to  the company's flood of investments in its non-core businesses. How should investors view the debate around SQ stock?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 AI Stocks to Buy to Profit from the Recent Tech Correction  High-Growth Stocks Have Been Under Some PressureAggressive, high-valuation growth stocks in general have not had a great autumn. The slump of multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud stocks appears to be spreading. For the time being, the collapse of WeWork has caused investors to flee many speculative growth companies. That's an understandable reaction. But some folks may be dumping good stocks along with the losers.Many of the SaaS stocks dropped as much as 30% from peak to bottom before starting to recover last week. Even payment names like Visa (NYSE:V) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) were getting hit until PayPal came through with great earnings last Wednesday.Now Square stock's drop doesn't look quite so bad. Still, the company has clearly underperformed both its payment peers and the tech sector. The Valuation of SQ Stock Is SteepThe main issue that analysts dislike about SQ stock is that its revenue growth has fallen significantly. Yet the company still hasn't become meaningfully profitable. The forward price-earnings ratio of SQ stock still comes in above 50, which is rather steep.A huge valuation multiple would make sense if Square still had a clear path to growth. However, its revenues are decelerating, with its competition mounting. It's far from certain how successful Square's investments outside of its core payment business will be, either. More than 50 times forward earnings and nearly seven times sales is not exactly a cheap price for SQ stock given those facts. Will Cash App Become a Big Success?A big part of the reason for the conflicting narratives around SQ stock is what to make of Cash App. The bulls can certainly make a solid case for Cash App being a strong driver of SQ stock going forward.The revenue of the Cash App ecosystem has reached a run rate of about $1 billion annually. Net revenues are less, of course, but they are still running well over $500 million annually at this point, making up a meaningful part of Square's overall $4 billion in annual sales.And you have to give credit to Square's management team for being innovative. It made bitcoin trading a main feature of the Cash App well before other services got into that game. Similarly, Cash App recently launched an effort to offer free stock trading within the application.Both of those specific efforts come with clear downsides, however. Bitcoin's price has never come close to reclaiming the heights of late 2017, and after a rally earlier this year, crypto is skidding lower again.Meanwhile, the effort to be the Robinhood of stock trading fell flat as Charles Schawb (NYSE:SCHW), TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) and a host of other brokerages just announced commission-free trading as well.Consumer financial services is exceptionally competitive, and it's not clear that Cash App has established much of a meaningful and durable competitive advantage. Its business has done well so far, and Square's leadership deserves credit for that. But it's hard to get a good sense of what Cash App will be worth to Square in five or ten years. There are simply too many unpredictable factors at this point. The Verdict on SQ StockI'd love to get on the bandwagon  of Square stock. There's a lot to like about SQ, particularly if it can keep evolving Cash App so it stays on top of emerging consumer trends. SQ certainly has the potential to be a stock that, over the long-run,  produces multiples of one's original investment. And with the shares down 40% from their all-time highs, the entry point is certainly reasonable.That said, there are still a few too many question marks on SQ stock for me to get completely on board. And the bull case seems a bit too easy. Payments is a difficult business; for every PayPal that succeeds, there are  a bunch of also-rans that have fallen by the wayside.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) successfully turned things around, or at least was on the right path until recently. So folks believe that Jack Dorsey, the CEO of both companies, can  potentially achieve similar success with Square. But the payments business is harder than advertising on social media.SQ could certainly be successful. The selloff of tech stocks generally is overdone, and SQ stock will probably bounce going forward There is a lot left to prove in terms of the longer-term investment case, however.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned none of the aforementioned securities.

In the second quarter of 2019 alone, S&P; 500 companies spent almost $165 billion on share repurchases - and that was 26% less than the record high spent in Q4 2018.But it's still a big number. &quot;While the decline is significant compared to 2018, it remains higher than the pre-2018 levels,&quot; writes Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices.Buybacks yield several benefits. Among them, given the simple math of calculating earnings per share (EPS) - total earnings divided by total shares outstanding - buying back shares can &quot;juice&quot; the EPS figure. Moreover, they tilt supply and demand in shareholders' favor. If a company takes shares off the market, in theory, it should make the remaining ones worth more.But are stock buybacks a reason to buy?

2019-11-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Explore what’s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast. Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.U.S. hiring was unexpectedly resilient in October and prior months saw sharp upward revisions, validating the Federal Reserve’s signal of a pause from interest-rate cuts and indicating consumers will extend the record-long expansion despite weak business investment and trade tensions.Stocks rose to fresh records and Treasuries fell after the strong report.Payrolls increased 128,000 after an upwardly revised 180,000 advance the prior month, according to a Labor Department report Friday that exceeded the median 85,000 estimate in Bloomberg’s survey. That includes a General Motors Co. strike-driven 41,600 decline in automaker payrolls and 20,000 temporary census workers leaving their jobs.The jobless rate edged up to 3.6% from a half-century low, as black unemployment fell to a new record low of 5.4% Average hourly earnings climbed 3% from a year earlier, matching projections after an upward revision the prior month, though the 0.2% monthly gain was slightly below estimates.Click here for Bloomberg’s TOPLive blog on the jobs report.The report supports Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s assessment this week that the U.S. economic outlook remains solid and the job market “strong” -- allowing the central bank to take a breather after a third straight interest-rate cut -- despite a persistent trade war with China and an increasingly dim global situation. With businesses pulling back on fixed investment, solid gains in hiring and wages will help drive growth and support President Donald Trump’s bid for re-election in 2020.“Overall the labor market is holding up very, very nicely,” Michael Brown, principal U.S. economist at Visa USA Inc., said by phone. “There’s no signs here the consumer is losing any momentum.”Fed policy makers are “probably on hold for a while,” Brown said. “Today’s report certainly supports the Fed view that they have provided accommodation and they’ll take a little victory lap.”Revisions added 95,000 jobs for the prior two months, bringing the three-month average to 176,000, though gains remain below 2018 levels.Minutes after the report, Trump tweeted that it was a “blowout” number and even more impressive when accounting for revisions and the GM strike. The president touted an “adjusted” employment gain of 303,000, which economic adviser Larry Kudlow said adds back in 60,000 jobs related to the strike on top of the revisions and census jobs.What Our Economists Say“The labor data continue to corroborate a moderation in the pace of economic activity in the latter half of the year, but the resilience in the pace of hiring signals that growth is cooling, not collapsing.”-- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Eliza WingerClick here for the full reaction note.A note of caution came separately Friday in the Institute for Supply Management’s factory purchasing managers index. That gauge trailed estimates for October and signaled the sector contracted for a third straight month, with the weakest production level since the last recession.The jobs data come on the heels of reports this week including third-quarter gross domestic product. The economy grew at a 1.9% annualized pace as consumer spending grew 2.9% -- a step down from gangbusters growth in the prior period but exceeding last year’s average. Stocks also hit a record high, even as the figures showed business investment fell for a second straight period and the most since 2015.“This was certainly a very solid labor market report,” Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We have ongoing growth in the economy, we have inflation near our objective so the economy is in a very good place.”Manufacturers subtracted 36,000 jobs, the biggest drop since 2009, though it would likely have been a gain without the effects of the strike. Still, even excluding the impact of the walkout, the sector has become increasingly fragile amid slowing global growth, a strong dollar and an ongoing trade war with China.The strike may also have hit wages in October. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% from the prior month, below estimates, following little change the prior month. Annual wage gains have cooled since hitting a peak of 3.4% early in the year. Hours worked were unchanged at 34.4 per week.The job gains were led by leisure and hospitality, education and health services and professional and business services. Construction and finance also posted gains. Even retail jobs rose, registering back-to-back gains for the first time in more than a year following seven straight declines.The participation rate, or share of working-age people in the labor force, increased to 63.3%, the highest since 2013, as more Americans were pulled from the sidelines and into the workforce.The U-6, or underemployment rate, ticked up to 7% from the lowest since 2000; some analysts see this figure as a more accurate reflection of the true labor market as it includes part-time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and those who aren’t actively looking.(Updates with Fed vice chairman’s comment, ISM index, Kudlow comment.)&#92;--With assistance from Jordan Yadoo, Sophie Caronello, Katia Dmitrieva and William Edwards.To contact the reporter on this story: Reade Pickert in Washington at epickert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Scott Lanman at slanman@bloomberg.net, Vince GolleFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","U.S. Hiring Resilient With 128,000 Gain, Validating Fed Pause"

2019-11-06,"The corps of Wall Street stock analysts numbers in the thousands, but at the top stand a select few, those analysts with the experience and savvy to pull together the facts and discern the probable path of the markets. You can find these top analysts, the best of the best, at TipRanks Top 25 Analysts, a list of the Street’s top performing stock watchers.Among these top analysts, there is a standout. Glenn Greene, ranked 3 overall, is also the top analyst from Oppenheimer, the New York City-based investment bank. The big Wall Street firms are also rated at TipRanks, and Oppenheimer holds the 4 spot among the Top Research firms. This combination of a top individual rating with a top institutional rating gives extra weight to Greene’s stock ratings.In the last two weeks, Greene has applied his expertise to the major players in the payment processing sector. Let's take a closer look:Mastercard (MA)We’ll start with Mastercard, by market cap, at $271.4 billion, the second largest credit card company in the world. Strictly speaking, MA is not truly a credit card company; it’s a payment processor. The actual cards are issued by banks or other financial institutions, and branded with Mastercard’s logo. Mastercard, the parent company, collects royalties on the logo and branding use, as well as buyer and seller transaction fees every time such a card is swiped.It’s a solid and profitable business model, as evidenced by Mastercard’s appreciation since the market bottomed last December. MA shares are up 42.6% year-to-date, far outperforming the broader markets. For comparison, the S&P 500 gain this year is 22.7%. In its Q3 earnings, reported late last month, MA showed an EPS of $2.15 against a forecast of $2.01, and reported a 14% yearly increase in gross dollar volume of transactions, to $1.7 trillion.Greene noted, “Mastercard delivered strong 3Q19 results with ~16% CC revenue growth and EPS of $2.15... MA modestly increased core FY19 guidance, which now anticipates the high end of low-teens CC revenue growth... We update our estimates to reflect strong quarterly results and now estimate ~18% EPS growth in FY19, which anticipates continued solid broad-based volume momentum.” Greene’s $312 price target on MA suggests an upside potential of 16% to the stock.Greene is not the only analyst giving MA some love. The shares have a unanimous analyst consensus of Strong Buy, based on 18 recent buy ratings. The average price target of $316 represents a 17% upside from the share price of $269. (See Mastercard stock analysis on TipRanks)Visa, Inc. (V)Visa is Mastercard’s bigger twin. Like MA, Visa no longer issues cards itself – it uses the same model of collecting royalties for branding, plus transactions fees on card use. And like Mastercard, Visa finds the model profitable. In its fiscal Q4, reported last month, Visa showed a 13% yearly gain in revenue, to $5.43 billion for the quarter, and an impressive 21% yearly gain in non-GAAP EPS, to $1.21. Quarterly net income, at $3.03 billion, was also up, gaining 6.3% from the $2.85 billion reported last year. Payment volume – the standard metric of total Visa card use – was up 9% from the year-ago quarter.Visa’s strong growth in all metrics reflects both the increasing use of digital payments and continued high consumer confidence and spending in the US. The first factor is likely to continue supporting Visa into the indefinite future; the second is fickle, but likely to continue for the next 6 to 12 months. Even if consumer confidence declines, Visa, with over $20 billion in total revenues in the last fiscal year, and more than $10 billion in net income, has the resources to hold fast.Those resources were Greene’s mind when he titled his recent note on Visa, “V Finishes Year on Solid Note; Provides Encouraging Outlook.” In the note, Greene pointed out that the company gave an optimistic outlook for FY2020, guiding on low-double-digit credit card revenue growth. He wrote in his bottom line, “We are highly attracted to Visa's powerful brand, vast global acceptance network and strong business model. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular shift from paper currency to plastic, consumer spending growth and increased globalization.” Greene’s $202 price target on V indicates his confidence in 14% growth.Overall, V stock gets another unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. No less than 8 analysts have up-checked this stock in recent weeks. Shares sell for $178, and the average price target of $206 suggests an upside potential of 16%.

This company led the way in online digital payments, and in the four years since it spun off of eBay as an independent entity, it has grown to $15.5 billion in annual revenue and more than $2 billion in net income. Looking at other metrics of success, PayPal has over 286 million active users across 202 separate markets worldwide. Customers can hold, send, or receive funds in 25 different currencies.Like its more traditional peers, PayPal reported earnings in late October. The company showed a 195 gain in revenue, hitting $4.38 billion for the quarter, and a 25% gain in total payment volume – one of the company’s key metrics – to $178.67 billion. Both revenues and total payment volume beat the pre-earnings forecasts. PayPal’s net income for the quarter was $462 million, or 39 cents per share. The EPS was up 8% from one year ago.Green acknowledged both PayPal’s current strong quarter and its recent headwinds in the opening of his recent note on the stock: “After a disappointing 2Q, PayPal delivered strong 3Q results as revenue grew 19%.” In his bottom line, he wrote, “PayPal has an attractive business model characterized by transaction-related fees, relatively low capital requirements, and strong free cash flow generation... We think PYPL is particularly well positioned to benefit as retail activity continues to migrate from brick-and-mortar stores toward online and mobile venues.” Greene gave PYPL a $125 price target, implying an upside of 24%.Green is certainly not the first analyst with an optimistic outlook for the online payment giant, as TipRanks analytics showcasing PayPal stock as a Strong Buy. With an average stock-price forecast of $127.22, analysts are predicting an upside of nearly 26%. In total, the stock has received 17 'buy' ratings vs. just 4 'hold' ratings in the past three months.

2019-11-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese payments giants Alipay and WeChat Pay, long a source of worry among competitors abroad, plan to open up their platforms to foreigners visiting the mainland as regulators ease restrictions.The apps, which dominate payments across the world’s second-largest economy and have even supplanted cash at some businesses, announced the plans in rapid succession after previously requiring users to have local accounts. Opening up to visitors may give an incremental boost to spending on the platforms -- but for overseas firms, it has big implications, potentially helping pave the way for future adoption abroad.“Although there will be some revenue coming from the foreigners using the card, the more interesting aspect is how seamless the cross-border Alipay and WeChat Pay experience is becoming,” said Zennon Kapron, founder and director of research consultant Kapronasia.Behind the scenes, China’s central bank recently told a number of payments firms they will soon be allowed to plug foreign cards into their apps for use in China, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Previously, regulatory concerns about money laundering and cross-border cash flows had prevented that from happening. The central bank offered no immediate comment to an inquiry sent by fax.The move will provide relief to some of the more-than 30 million people who visit China annually and sometimes struggle to find alternate payment methods. Alipay and Tencent account for 94% of the country’s mobile-payment market.Already, Alipay and WeChat Pay’s logos are visible in stores and taxis in major cities around the world as the firms focus on helping Chinese travelers there. The expectation across the industry is that the apps will someday use that infrastructure to attract locals in those destinations.To be sure, the ability to work with credit cards is still pending. In its announcement, Ant Financial’s Alipay laid out a system that will work around current restrictions and can start immediately.Alipay said it’s letting travelers use a prepaid card service provided by the Bank of Shanghai. That means customers will have to periodically top off that account, which will be limited in amount.In contrast, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay intends to let people more directly connect their existing cards to its app. Visa described that plan in a statement of support early Wednesday in China, saying it will essentially enable its cards to work across China.“This is a great step forward, both for consumers traveling to China and the overall payments industry,” Visa said. “This partnership means that we’ll be working towards an environment where Visa cardholders will be able to use their Visa card in China at the millions of places where WeChat Pay is accepted, instead of having to rely on cash.”The companies didn’t provide a time frame.Tencent, acknowledging that it’s working under guidelines from regulators, said it has been discussing cooperation with U.S. card-network operators Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover as well as Japan’s JCB to support the linking of overseas credit cards to Wechat Pay.(Updates with researcher’s comment, regulatory guidance, statistics on market from third paragraph.)To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Lucille Liu in Beijing at xliu621@bloomberg.net;Heng Xie in Beijing at hxie34@bloomberg.net;Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jun Luo at jluo6@bloomberg.net, David ScheerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Alipay, WeChat Pay Open Apps to Foreigners Visiting China"

2019-11-08,"Visa (NYSE:V) stock has exhibited a behavior not seen in a long time, it has stayed in place. The payments processor has consistently moved higher for the last few years as consumers across the world increasingly moved to card-based transactions. However, the lack of movement leaves V stock investors wondering what to do.Source: Shutterstock Market trends have left it seemingly immune from secular downturns. Still, it has also stopped responding positively. Considering the stock's history, as long as V stock remains in its current position, traders should probably do the same. Payment Trends, Dominance at Home Drive VisaVisa stock has performed well over the last few years. The company benefits as society increasingly turns from cash in favor of electronic payments. Within the U.S., most of those are made on Visa cards as the firm gains market share over processors such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsVisa processed 53.1% of U.S. card transactions in 2018. Despite the competition, this percentage has continued to grow. Moreover, it operates on all six continents and lags only China UnionPay in worldwide transactions.  * 7 Buy-Rated Stocks With Dividend Yields Over 9% At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.4, few consider this a cheap stock. However, with the record of profit growth it continues to accumulate, I find it hard to argue with the valuation. Over the previous five years, earnings grew by an average of 21.47% per year. Profit growth will slow somewhat in the future but remain robust. Wall Street forecasts earnings increases of 14.3% this year and 16.4% in the next.Clearly, Visa remains a strong stock. While I do not think cash will completely disappear, more people will conduct more transactions via card. Moreover, with numerous countries in the world mostly using physical cash, Visa has the potential to maintain double-digit growth for years to come. V Stock Has Become Range-BoundThe near-term problem for V stock is its lack of traction. On July 19, I urged investors not to buy Visa stock as valuations fully reflected growth potential. Other investors seem to see what I saw. Since that day, the V stock price is just under $180 per share, representing almost no change from mid-July levels.Hence, the question for investors is what will move V stock? Will it fall over a market downturn, or will a comparatively cheap valuation finally motivate buyers?Despite the ten-plus-year length of the economic expansion, it shows no signs of recession. This is significant because it takes turmoil in the market to take V stock into correction territory. It fell briefly into a bear market in the fall 2018 stock selloff. However, before that, it had not seen a significant selloff since 2010. This makes me wonder if this plateau is the closest thing we will see to a correction.For now, valuation looks like a more likely catalyst. When I warned investors to not buy in July, the forward P/E ratio stood above 29. With that forward multiple now at 24.4, the plateau has improved the buy case for V stock. Still, its 52-week high stands at $187.05 per share. That is only around 4% lower than the current price.If it can move to the $190 per share level and stay there, V stock will likely keep moving higher. However, if we experience a downturn in the market, investors may have a chance to buy in at a lower price. For now, all investors can do is wait. The Bottom Line on Visa StockSince V stock shows little movement, investors should probably do the same. Due in large part to e-commerce, traders across the world have turned more often to using credit cards. This plays in Visa's favor as a slight majority of U.S. card transactions take place on Visa's payment network. This will also continue to make V stock a long-term winner.  * 10 Monster Growth Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond However, with a slightly elevated P/E ratio, Visa stock currently prices in its present and future growth. With V stock staying in place, traders have no clue as to the direction of Visa in the short term. The lack of movement effectively lowers the P/E ratio due to profit growth.Moreover, V stock has no recent history of falling significantly without a market downturn.Until Visa can break out of its current trading range, traders have little reason to buy.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-11-08,"On Nov. 6, digital payments company Square (NYSE:SQ) released its third-quarter  financial results.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Square stock has been at the forefront of the fintech (financial technology) revolution. Both the company and the owners of SQ stock have been benefiting from the disruptive shift from physical money to digital financial services and products.In 2019, the SQ share price is up about 15%. In the wake of the Q3 results, I believe that the owners of Square stock may have to reset their overly optimistic growth and share price expectations for the rest of the year. In the coming weeks, I'd be a buyer of SQ stock below $60, especially if Square stock approaches or goes below $55. Here are the important fundamental and technical issues that are affecting SQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Analyzing Square's Q3 ResultsSquare's Q3 revenue and earnings came in above analysts' average outlook. However, the company lowered its full-year guidance.  * 3 Positive Market Signals for the Rest of 2019 Its total revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.27 billion. Its earnings per share, excluding certain items,  was 25 cents, beating the average forecast of 20 cents.The company's quarterly gross payment volume (GPV), or the total volume of payments the company processes, increased 25% YoY to $28.2 billion.Management noted that Square Terminal and Square Register, SQ's newest hardware solutions, are enabling the company to cater to larger businesses, helping drive up Square's GPV. When SQ reports its Q4 results, investors are likely to continue to pay attention to this number.The Q3 report once again confirmed that SQ stock is growing rapidly, thanks to its seller ecosystem and Square Cash, the company's consumer digital money transfer service.In general, growth stocks are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel expectations for growth names need to be toned down, they sell the companies' stocks first and ask questions later.For fiscal year 2020, SQ's management expects low-30% YoY adjusted revenue and gross profit growth. That was viewed as  disappointing by investors.Therefore, SQ stock is likely to be choppy in the next few days. Analyzing the Price Action of SQ StockBy analyzing the price action of SQ stock, we can obtain a better view of what to expect from the shares in the coming weeks.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, the shares have been weak since reaching their all-time high of $99 in late September 2018. Yet, by late December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.After a highly volatile first half of 2019, on Aug. 1 Square stock hit a recent high of $83.20.However, the rest of August was not a good month for Square stock. That was partly due to its weak Q3 guidance, which surprised investors. On Sep. 24, the shares hit a recent low of $54.41.On Nov. 6, prior to the release of its Q3 earnings, Square stock closed at $61.34. Now the shares are hovering around $65.From a technical  perspective, I'm not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, SQ stock is likely to be range-bound between $60 and $67.5.The next rally will occur only when long-term investors feel that  the price of SQ stock is justified by its future growth expectations. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing Square stock at this point. Square Stock Is Still Richly ValuedAlthough the recent decline of SQ stock has made its valuation more attractive, the shares are still richly valued.While SQ already serves many small businesses, Wall Street has questions about whether it can maintain its growth. Especially if the U.S. economy slows, Square's growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.SQ's competition has also increased. Square must now compete with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa (NYSE:V) and Fiserv  (NASDAQ:FISV), which is becoming a global-payments giant.The forward price-earnings ratio of SQ stock  is over 54. On the other hand, the forward P/E ratios of PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about 29, 28 and  23 respectively.Similarly Square stock's current price-sales ratio is over 6,3. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective, the S&P 500's average price-sales ratio is 2.2x.In short, investors are still paying a hefty premium to own SQ stock. Thus, I do not think there is much room for Square stock's valuation to head higher in Q4. Sooner or later, SQ stock's valuation and its revenue growth will be more balanced. So Should Investors Buy SQ Stock Now?Fintech is still developing rapidly in terms of total market capitalization as well as the products and services it offers. And the fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers.Therefore, over the long-term, I would not bet against SQ stock. The shares have generated solid long-term returns, especially for those who invested early in SQ. The company is likely to  grow further as the fintech market matures.In the short-term, though, the owners of SQ stock shouldn't expect smooth sailing. I believe the markets are likely to be volatile in the rest of November. Like many momentum plays, Square stock will probably be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.SQ stock has a high beta of 3.3. The stock market has a beta of 1.0. SQ stock's beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, SQ rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling.Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock's wide daily swings. The hype surrounding fintech stocks, including SQ, can easily cause them to rise quickly and become overvalued.It is likely that Square stock may fall toward $60 or even $55, At that point,  I'd expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until its next earnings release, expected to occur in early February.In other words, I' wouldn't rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I'd get ready to initiate a position in SQ as the price declines further towards $55.At the time of writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-08,"It's been a rough past 12 months for shares of payments processor Square (NYSE:SQ), as slowing growth trends coupled with competition and valuation concerns have caused SQ stock to plunge from an all-time high price tag of $100 back in late September 2018, to a $50 price tag in late September 2019.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com But, SQ stock is starting to show signs of life again. In early November 2019, the company reported third-quarter numbers that were much better than expected, and broadly eased slowing growth and competition concerns. Square stock popped about 5% to three-month highs in response to the strong print.Is this post-earnings pop in SQ stock the start of a bigger rebound? Or is it just a head-fake in a stock that's doomed to head lower?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI think it's the former. The strong third-quarter earnings report added further evidence to the notion that this company can simultaneously sustain strong revenue growth at scale, while rapidly improving its margin profile. This combination paves the path for Square to generate robust profit growth over the next few years. Some of that profit growth is priced into SQ stock today. Some isn't. The part that isn't is what will drive SQ stock higher from here.The investment implication? Buy into the Square stock rebound. This stock is heading for $70 soon. Square Earnings Add Credibility to Bull ThesisIn the big picture, Square's third-quarter earnings report was yet another piece of evidence providing support for the bull thesis underpinning Square stock.What is that bull thesis? Thanks to secular growth trends supporting broader adoption of non-cash payments globally, Square is well positioned to deliver sustained strong revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Stock Up On It may sound like a mouthful. But, when you break it down, it's simple. Consumers everywhere are pivoting to non-cash payments because paying with a card or a phone is so much easier than paying with cash. Businesses globally have to keep up with this pivot. Square builds solutions which allow them to do that. At first, Square simply offered businesses point-of-sale hardware solutions so that they could accept all sorts of non-cash payments. Now, Square has since built out an ecosystem of software offerings complementing the core non-cash payment process, and all of these services feature high gross margins, so scale should ultimately drive big revenues and big profits here.At this point, the numbers tell the story. Gross payment volume through Square's ecosystem rose 25% year-over-year in Q3, following 25% growth last quarter. Adjusted revenue growth was yet again in the 40%-and-up territory. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 500 basis points year-over-year to record highs, continuing what has been a multi-year stretch of margin improvements. The guide calls for all this to continue next quarter.Square is leveraging product innovation and secular growth tailwinds to sustain big revenue growth at scale and drive margins significantly higher. This trend has been alive for several years now. The more quarters Square turns in like this one, the more likely it appears that this trend will remain alive for the next several years, too. Square Stock Is UndervaluedGiven increased support for the notion that Square will remain a big revenue and profit growth company for a lot longer, SQ stock appears undervalued under $65.The numbers are simple. Global retail sales are projected to grow at a 4%-5% annualized pace over the next few years. In 2019, Square projects to own about 0.42% of the global retail sales pie, up from 0.35% in 2018, 0.28% in 2017 and 0.23% in 2016. Thus, thanks mostly to secular tailwinds underpinning non-cash payment adoption, Square has been able to consistently grow share in the global retail market.This dynamic will continue. Assuming Square continues to expand share at a cadence of 5 to 7 basis points each year, and further assuming that Square's services ecosystem continues to expand and become more valuable in a non-cash dominated world, then Square should easily remain a 20%-plus revenue growth company for the next several years.Profit margins should continue to improve. All of Square's businesses operate at high gross margins. Operating expense growth will be big to support big growth. But, it won't be 20%-plus big. As such, steady 20%-plus revenue growth on top of sub-20% expense growth should drive healthy margin expansion.This combination of 20%-plus revenue growth and steady margin expansion should drive somewhere around 30%-plus profit growth. By my numbers, Square will hit $4 in earnings per share by fiscal 2025. Mature payments companies, like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), trade around 30-times forward earnings. Applying that industry-average multiple to $4 in 2025 EPS, you arrive at a 2024 price target for SQ stock of $120.Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a 2019 price target for SQ stock of $75. That's notably higher than where shares trade hands today. Bottom Line on SQ StockSquare stock has been beaten and bruised over the past year, mostly thanks to slowing growth trends giving credence to the idea that competition is killing the Square growth narrative.But, in the third quarter, growth trends stabilized sequentially. This sequential stabilization in growth erodes the bear thesis which has dominated SQ stock over the past year. Instead, it adds credibility to the idea that Square will sustain large revenue growth at scale for a lot longer.With respect to SQ stock, the impacts of this are obvious. If this growth stabilization persists -- and it should -- the past year's selloff in SQ stock, could turn into a rally over the next year.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long SQ.

2019-11-11,"Following earnings, is it still hip to be keen on Square (NYSE:SQ)? Let's take a look at what's happened off and on the SQ stock price chart in the report's aftermath to reach a stronger risk-adjusted determination.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Mobile payments innovator Square's latest quarterly confessional has come and gone. And with shares largely where they were in front of the report after a decent bout of price volatility, suffice it to say SQ stock still has its share of bulls and bears. But despite investors proving indecisive, my view is that Square stock unequivocally continues to impress.For its third-quarter confessional, SQ stock offered growth-backed and better-than-expected revenues of $602 million. Sales beat consensus views of $596.4 million, increased by 40% year-over-year and were supported by solid growth in the company's Square Cash consumer app and bitcoin transactions. Square stock's earnings also looked smart. Profits of 25 cents per share jumped more than 90% from 2018 and easily topped Street forecasts of 20 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLooking ahead, there is some controversy. The Square story continues to shape up, with management expecting fiscal 2020 revenue and gross profit growth in the low 30% range. The forecast puts SQ stock in a league of its own compared to peer PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or credit card giant Visa (NYSE:V). But guidance is below analyst views.As well, reduced EBITDA margins of 18%, which are flat with 2019 due to higher investment spending, was a concern for some on Wall Street like Instinet's Bill Carcache. At the same time InvestorPlace's Vince Martin is simply concerned guidance isn't enough to offset SQ stock's market premium in a more risk-averse environment.  * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth Bottom line, SQ stock is obviously not pleasing everyone, despite overall solid earnings and a report which builds the case that Square stock can sustain strong growth at scale. As well, it goes without saying there's going to be the same kind of disagreement on the SQ price chart where bulls and bears battle it out. Square Stock Monthly Price ChartThree sessions into the post-report period, it's our technical interpretation that the Square chart remains a constructive one.On the monthly view, we can see Square stock is stationed near the high of September's bottoming hammer pattern. Our view is this candlestick is a higher-low pivot within a year-long bullish &quot;W&quot; or double-bottom formation. What's more, the pattern has formed on a successful test of key zone support and stochastics are just now crossing over in oversold territory.In total, the technical situation offers bullish investors the opportunity to buy SQ stock at advantageous prices with the expectation shares will climb from here and eventually break out to fresh all-time-highs in 2020. SQ Stock StrategyMy advice is to simply buy SQ stock today. For a straight-up long stock position, a stop beneath $57 looks like sufficient exposure off and on the price chart. And for other like-minded bulls focused on the long game, an option-based collar is a favored strategy to position for success.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management own positions in Square (SQ) stock and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.

2019-11-11,"It's a tricky time to be an investor right now. The market keeps climbing to new highs, but the threat of a recession continues to loom as political uncertainty and troubling macroeconomic factors keep investors from getting too comfortable. The result has been an unstable bull market in which traders are constantly worried about a drop-off. So are there any good stocks to buy in a market that keeps ticking upward?Yes and no. If you've got a long timeline and you can stomach a bit of turbulence, then you should be focused on buying quality companies that have the financial fortitude to thrive in a downturn.

Nobody's coming to your house to take your children. It's two quarters -- six months that the economy shrinks. It's not the end of the world. The job market has been strong. There are more jobs today than people looking to fill them. Do I think the economy will shrink in two consecutive quarters? I don't know. Maybe, but it would first have to shrink in one quarter and that hasn't happened yet.&quot; He's not wrong. If you stayed out of the market completely over the past few months because you were worried about a crash, you could have missed out on some pretty incredible gains this earnings season. Now isn't the time to panic, it's the time to ensure you're well diversified and pick up long-term bets that will carry you through a downturn should it materialize.   * 7 Large-Cap Stocks to Give a Wide Berth Here's a look at three stocks worth considering as the market continues to fly higher.

The firm makes a wide variety of coatings, paints, packaging and polymers. As part of its packaging arm, DOW makes styrofoam, which has been one of its best selling products.While the firm's ties to crude oil make it susceptible to volatility associated with the rise and fall of oil prices, DOW stock's 5% dividend yield is a great way for long-term investors to build their wealth over time.

Visa (V)Source: Shutterstock Visa (NYSE:V) stock is up 26% so far this year, but it still makes for a good buy for long-term investors. The firm boasts a strong balance sheet and a track record of consistent dividend increases, V stock is a great play for those who are looking for a buy-and-hold investment.   * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for the End of the Year As payments continue to shift away from cash, Visa's strong position makes it likely to benefit as the industry grows over the next decade. The firm is also relatively safe compared to peers in the case of a recession. Visa operates as a payment processor and doesn't actually lend out money. That means the firm won't be bogged down by credit delinquency if the economy takes a turn for the worst. AT&T (T)Source: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.com AT&T (NYSE:T) stock suffered through the beginning of 2019, but despite the firm's impressive comeback so far, I believe it has further to climb in 2020. AT&T is working to pay down its debt pile and rework its business model, which hurt investors sentiment and took the share price lower at the end of 2018. However, T stock is on the edge of greatness should management be able to execute its strategy over the next few years.The firm is working to roll out a streaming service that will put its TimeWarner acquisition to use by drawing on the company's massive media library. Plus, AT&T is rolling out a 5G network across the U.S., which many believe will help the firm regain pricing power. To be sure, T stock likely still has some volatility to come in the near-term, but its 5.18% dividend yield makes riding out the bumps a bit easier. As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long T.

2019-11-12,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China’s most ubiquitous company is hiding one of its most valuable assets. That needs to change.Tencent Holdings Ltd., best known for the WeChat messenger that almost everyone in the country uses, has a growing fintech business. But it’s getting overshadowed by the games and social media divisions. By spinning it off into a new company, with a move to a separate listing, management could unlock as much as $230 billion in value. That would make the entity China’s fourth-largest listed company and the world’s sixth-biggest financial services firm.Such a move could help Tencent retake some of the limelight that it’s about to share with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. once that company lists in Hong Kong. Alibaba’s fintech unit, Ant Financial Services Group, already functions as a separate business with the e-commerce giant holding a 33% stake. At Tencent, fintech and business services accounted for 26% of revenue last quarter. The Shenzhen-based company is due to report third-quarter earnings late Wednesday.I estimate that revenue from Tencent’s fintech business grew in excess of 70% last year.(1)  The vast majority of that was payments. Yet Tencent also offers other products such as wealth management and has a 30% stake in WeBank, China’s first online-only bank, which was founded five years ago. Data on its fintech profits are hard to ascertain, yet information disclosed by Alibaba shows that Ant Financial was unprofitable last year, so Tencent could be in a similar boat. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The two rivals are startups in the classic sense, using fast revenue growth driven by marketing and incentives to gain ground fast. A major reason why both have lost money in recent years is due to low take rates, the commissions received from processing payments, because they’ve offered discounts to consumers and merchants. A turnaround could be near, Sanford C Bernstein senior analyst David Dai wrote in a recent series on China’s fintech sector. He estimates that a maturing market will ease cut-throat competition and allow both companies to take a greater share of the money that sloshes through their payments platforms.As a result, Tencent’s payment business (TenPay) alone could be worth $137 billion, compared to $127 billion for Ant’s AliPay, the Bernstein team figures. HSBC Holdings Plc uses two methodologies(2) to come up with an estimated value of around $128 billion. Throw in the other products, and Bernstein calculates a base-case valuation for Tencent’s fintech unit of $160 billion, going as high as $230 billion. This indicates that 40% to 58% of Tencent’s current market cap is locked up in this hitherto hidden division. Bernstein has a base case of $210 billion for Ant, reaching as high as $320 billion.Payments spinoffs have proven to be lucrative in the past. EBay Inc. proved it with PayPal Holdings Inc. in 2015, with the latter posting a 177% normalized return since then, outpacing the 145% rise in the S&P Data Processing sub-index which includes Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. PayPal also trounced both eBay (35%) and the S&P 500 (49%). Square Inc., another payments provider, has been one of the hottest stocks of the past decade, returning more than 590% since its initial public offering in 2015.A more recent example comes from India, where Walmart Inc. is reported to be spinning off payments business PhonePe from local e-commerce company Flipkart Group, which it acquired last year. That transaction could turn a $20.8 billion startup into two unicorns with a combined value of more than $30 billion. Tencent doesn’t need to rush to list this fintech unit. Appetite for mega IPOs is likely to be satiated by Alibaba’s Hong Kong listing and that of Saudi Aramco over the next few months. And there’s a long runway of big startups ready for their moment in the sun. By merely making it a separate entity, management can signal intent and allow investors to start re-rating Tencent’s stock accordingly.An offering may not even be necessary, since Tencent is already sitting on more cash than it needs. Instead, the company could distribute shares in Tencent Fintech to existing shareholders, and then directly list the stock. That’s similar to the approach advocated by activist investor Dan Loeb for a Sony Corp. split.Tencent is sitting on a bright light in this fintech unit. Time to let it shine.(Updates to include reference to third-quarter earnings schedule in third paragraph.)(1) The &quot;others&quot; category includes fintech, cloud, film & TV. Tencent noted that fintech is the major component and gave a figure for cloudbut not content.(2) HSBC Approach 1: valuation per user. Approach 2: Using Tencent operating margins applied to its payments business, then comparing to peers.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-11-19,"Markets were stuck in a duel between varying considerations today. On one hand, there were new developments on the trade front. On the other, investors had to contend with some disappointment on the earnings and guidance fronts from some well-known brick-and-mortar retailers.Source: FinViz   * The S&P 500 shed 0.05%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%  * The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2%  * Home Depot was one of the worst-performing names in the Dow Jones today following downbeat guidanceWhile there was some retail wreckage to deal with, there remain some signs that the long sought after Phase I of a trade deal could be reached between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.&quot;The two sides, who are locked in tough -- perhaps final -- negotiations on a phase-one pact, are discussing linking the size of tariff rollbacks to the preliminary terms set in that failed May deal,&quot; Bloomberg reports, citing unidentified sources familiar with the matter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Killer Stocks No One Knows About Last year, President Trump imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods exported to the U.S. Reducing or eliminating those levies could go a long way toward jump-starting trade negotiations. The White House appears open to at least reducing some of those tariffs to get the initial part of the trade accord signed.Let's have a look at some of the Dow's winners and losers today, a split that was even with 15 Dow components in each category in late trading. Honing In On Home DepotHome Depot (NYSE:HD) was by far the worst-performing member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average today, shedding 5.4%, more than the double the loss incurred by the index's second-worst performer.Causes for Tuesday's tumble in HD stock are easy to spot. The Atlanta-based company said earlier today it expects 2019 sales growth of 3.5%, down from a prior forecast of 4%.&quot;Our third quarter results reflected broad-based growth across our business, yet sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,&quot; said CEO Craig Menear in a statement. &quot;We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.&quot;Analysts didn't overreact to Home Depot's reduced sales forecast with some saying the weakness was expected and that the shares are still worth embracing. Boeing UpdateIt has been a little while since Boeing's (NYSE:BA) last mention in this space, so an update is in order. The stock traded higher early in today's session, but sold off as the day went along. Today's price action in Boeing obfuscates some good news for the company.In recent days, Boeing landed 50 new orders for the controversial 737 MAX passenger jet, which it expects will be airborne again sometime in the coming weeks.&quot;Thirty are in the form of 'letters of intent,' which aren't firm orders and don't go into Boeing's backlog of commercial aircraft. Twenty are firm and go into the backlog. British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.London) also signed a letter of intent earlier this year for 200 MAX jets,&quot; according to Barron's. Apple ConcernsApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another Dow loser today, albeit in modest fashion. However, there are some concerns about valuations on the iPhone maker. That is to be expected when a company of Apple's size surges more than 69% in less than 11 months.Credit Suisse analyst Matthew Cabral, who has a &quot;Neutral&quot; rating and $221 price target on Apple, &quot;notes that the stock now trades for 20 times calendar 2020 earnings versus a five-year average of 13 times, and a previous peak of 17 times since 2010,&quot; reports Barron's.  * 7 Catalysts Pointing to Massive Potential in Chinese Biotech Stocks It's worth noting that expensive stocks can continue soaring and that by some metrics, Apple isn't all that pricey. For what it's worth, the stock is one of the largest components in the S&P 500 Value Index. Give Some CreditOn light news, Visa (NYSE:V) was the best-performing name in the Dow Jones today, gaining 1.7%. The company had recently been inking agreements with new clients and notes credit and debit card swipes are gaining steam, indicating the U.S. consumer still has some momentum. Bottom Line on Dow Jones TodayToday's piece started with trade and let's end on that note with positive vibes. Recent data suggest S&P 500 companies mentioning tariffs on their third-quarter earnings calls fell compared to second-quarter levels.During the Sept. 15 and Nov. 14 period, the &quot;number of S&P 500 companies discussing tariffs on Q3 2019 earnings calls during this time is below the number through the same point in time in the second quarter,&quot; according to FactSet research.In percentage, the tariff mention decrease was 13%.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-22,"After falling sharply in early August and into September, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock has made a slight rebound. Shares have climbed above the $60 price level, and closed yesterday at $67.42 a share. As SQ stock inches closer to the $70 price level, is now the time to buy?Source: Shutterstock Maybe not. True, the company's Nov. 6 earning releasecame in better than expected. But with shares trading at a rich valuation and competitors stepping up their game, it's important to note that Square stock is rife with risks. However, with last summer's beat-down of the share price, upside is also a possibility.Let's take a closer look, and see why all bets are off with SQ stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Square Stock is Starting to Feel RivalsFor the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2019, SQ sales were up 44% year-over-year, to $1.27 billion. But, this was only a slight boost from the prior quarter ($1.17 billion). Adjusted EBITDA came in at $131 million, up 85% from the prior year's quarter. Square reported adjusted revenue figures, but after an SEC comment letter, will discontinue using this non-GAAP metric. That adjusted revenue number consisted of revenue net of transaction and bitcoin expenses. The company used this figure to make it easier to compare results to peers.  * 5 Lottery Stocks With Triple-Digit Upside The company's Seller Ecosystem continues to grow, albeit at a slower clip. Sales were up 27% YoY. Square built its reputation by offering a seamless payment platform for small businesses. But now, other major payment players are looking to offer compelling alternatives to Square's Seller Ecosystem products.Fiserv's (NASDAQ:FISV) Clover Payment System is an example. With increased competition, Square's sales and marketing costs are projected to rise 48% this year. As a result, this competitive pressure could hurt margins, and make it tougher for Square stock to deliver prior rates of growth.But on the business-to-customer (B2C) side, SQ stock may have a catalyst in play. Square's growth driver this quarter was the Cash App platform. Cash App revenue grew 115% year-over-year, to $123 million. But Cash App also faces heavy competition from deep-pocketed peers. PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo is Cash App's main competitor. Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) recent launch of its Facebook Pay application could also impact Cash App's growth.Analysts are mixed whether Facebook Pay is a threat. RBC analyst Dan Perlin sees it as a negative for PayPal and Square stock. But MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis views it differently, seeing Facebook Pay as a facilitator of e-commerce, rather than a &quot;neobank&quot; like Cash App. SQ Stock Remains Richly Priced to Payment Processing PeersThe jury's out whether the emerging competition will hinder SQ sales growth. Analysts project sales of $2.85 billion in 2020, up from $2.24 billion in 2019. That means approximately 27% growth for the coming year.High growth is required to justify the valuation of Square stock. Shares continue to trade at a substantial premium to peers. Square's forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings ratio (non-GAAP forward P/E ratio) is 86.1. In contrast, competitor PayPal has a forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 34.1. Square's EV/EBITDA ratio is a staggering 360.7, compared to just 36.2 for PayPal.Looking at traditional payment processors, the valuation premium for Square stock is more substantial. Visa (NYSE:V) trades at 29.2x forward non-GAAP earnings. Its EV/EBITDA ratio is 25.5. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) trades for 37.1x forward earnings, and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 30. Stay on the Square Stock SidelinesEven with challenges to its business, Square stock remains overvalued. While the company's growth somewhat justifies a high valuation, compared to peers the stock is irrationally priced.  * 9 Tantalizing Dividend Stocks for 2020 How long can SQ stock trade at such a premium? I see one of two things happening to the shares in the coming months. Either the company takes another dive on missed expectations and greater competition. Or shares remain stagnant, as the company attempts to &quot;grow into its valuation&quot;.Either way, there's limited upside with SQ stock. But the company could surprise me. The success of Cash App shows Square can move from one success to another. Perhaps the company can innovate again, create another next-level financial service the moves the needle. Cash App is making big moves into commission-free trading, startup Robinhood's turf.It's tough to predict whether Square can parlay its payments processing success into becoming a fintech financial supermarket. But at the current valuation, I'm not willing to take that risk. All bets are off where Square stock will trade in 2020. Therefore, I prefer to stay on the sidelines.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

As has been the case for most of the past few months, the gains weren't exactly torrid, with the three major indices increasing roughly two-tenths of a percentage point. Still, optimism reigns heading into the holidays.Source: Shutterstock But not every stock has joined in the rally. Wednesday's big stock charts highlight three of those names. All three sit well off 52-week highs, and actually have weakened in recent months while the rest of the market has gained.  * 7 Stocks to Buy in December A reversal isn't guaranteed, or necessarily likely, for each of these stocks. But should positive market sentiment hold, they could be targets for investors looking for value in an increasingly expensive market. At the very least, these big stock charts suggest potentially big moves at the end of the year and into 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips PayPal Holdings (PYPL)Source: Provided by Finviz One curious aspect of the recent rally is that payment stocks like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have been mostly left out. But that may change. The first of Wednesday's big stock charts shows a recent bounce that sets up a potential breakout:  * PYPL stock has exited its downtrend and made a bullish reversal out of a descending narrowing wedge. The 20- and 50-day moving averages have been cleared. And volume has picked up in recent sessions. The 200-day moving average is the last potential source of resistance to a breakout; that aside, the chart here looks exceedingly bullish from a near-term standpoint.  * Again, PYPL stock hasn't been alone in underperforming. Payment stocks have been among the market's best the last few years: PayPal stock, for instance, has nearly tripled in the last five years. More recent trading has been softer. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have traded sideways for the past few months. Square (NYSE:SQ) bounced along its lows. There are signs of life, however. SQ stock has rallied and MA stock is challenging all-time highs reached in early September.  * It wouldn't be surprising to see PYPL stock (and potentially V stock) follow those peers. The sector should in theory do well in a bull market, as it has for the past decade. A 30x forward earnings multiple for PayPal stock isn't cheap, but it's reasonable in the context of the 14% profit growth expected next year. Certainly, there are stocks posting lower growth with higher multiples, as Tuesday's big stock charts showed. In that context, the case for a breakout in PYPL looks even stronger. Macy's (M)Source: Provided by Finviz Intrepid investors have been willing to step into the steep decline in Macy's (NYSE:M) stock in recent months. Support has held on several occasions above $14. M stock has rallied in recent sessions after selling off last week following disappointing earnings from rival Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and its own subpar third quarter release. But the second of Wednesday's big stock charts shows that support is getting weaker:  * The multiple bottom in M stock usually would be considered bullish, as support has held repeatedly. But the lower highs create a descending triangle, which creates an increased risk that Macy's stock will break through that support. The long-term chart is even weaker, showing a steady and concerning pattern of lower highs and lower lows, at least until the last few months.  * To be sure, Macy's stock seems almost absurdly cheap, at less than 6x this year's consensus earnings per share estimate. A nearly 10% dividend yield seems to add to the value case. But Q3 earnings were notably weak, and included the company's second guidance cut this year. Commentary on the Q3 earnings call seemed to imply that the payout could be cut. If earnings are headed for a permanent decline, even a multiple under 6x isn't cheap enough. After all, Macy's stock has looked cheap for years, but touched a post-crisis low in August.  * And so the case for M stock seems to come down to its real estate. A partnership with Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) sparked optimism earlier this year. Hedge fund Starboard Value pushed for real estate joint ventures in early 2016 before exiting its position the following year. If investors see value in the real estate, have trust in management, and stay as bullish as they've been of late, perhaps M stock finally can rally. That does seem like quite a few 'ifs,' however. Iron Mountain (IRM)Source: Provided by Finviz Fundamentally, data storage real estate investment trust Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) looks like a steal. 2019 guidance for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO), a common measurement of REIT profits, suggests a roughly 11x P/AFFO multiple. A 7.5% dividend yield looks attractive as well.But the third of our big stock charts does suggest near-term weakness, and looking closer there are fundamental concerns:  * Tuesday's decline pushes the stock out of an ascending narrowing wedge -- a classically bearish signal. IRM stock also broke through its moving averages, which leaves little in the way of near-term support. With resistance holding at $34, there's not much case for jumping in just yet.  * Fundamentally, it's true that IRM stock is cheap. But there are real risks here. Increasing digital storage limits the demand for Iron Mountain's services. A plan to pivot to data centers has moved slower than hoped. Ian Bezek last month called IRM stock a potential dividend trap, and he makes a good case.  * And so there's clear downside risk. A bull market might give IRM stock a reprieve, and better news on the data center front could change the narrative. Still, at the very least, investors might want to wait for a better entry point.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-12-12,"(Bloomberg) -- The embattled co-working company WeWork completed the first of what it hopes will be a series of asset sales by finding a buyer for Conductor, a unit that makes marketing software used by Visa Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.Seth Besmertnik, who co-founded Conductor before selling it to his college classmate Adam Neumann, will stay on as chief executive officer of the newly independent entity, the companies plan to announce Thursday. Besmertnik and other investors will contribute $15 million to fund operations and grant Conductor’s 250 or so employees majority ownership of the business through founder-class stock. Conductor and WeWork declined to disclose terms of the sale.For WeWork, selling off side businesses and turning attention back to co-working is a primary element of the turnaround plan set by the company’s new management. In October, SoftBank Group Corp. agreed to take a majority stake in WeWork, after a failed initial public offering put the company in danger of running out of money and cost Neumann the CEO job. SoftBank helped bring in new leaders, who are eliminating 2,400 jobs. WeWork is in talks to sell another business, Managed by Q, to a group of investors that includes the co-founder of that startup. And WeWork said Thursday that it’s shuttering a unit called Spacious that it acquired less than four months ago.Recent events have weighed heavily on morale inside WeWork. Conductor executives hope the new employee stock plan will raise spirits. In addition to holding a majority of stockholder votes, staff will be asked to elect a representative to the board. “This will ensure, in the long term, the company is always acting in the best interest of all the shareholders and that the employees have access to information about how we’re running the company,” Besmertnik said.Besmertnik helped start Conductor in 2010, eventually amassing more than 400 customers using its software to design marketing campaigns and optimize websites for search engines. Conductor had raised more than $60 million in venture funding, a laudable figure for a corporate software company but far from the more than $12 billion Neumann took in for WeWork.Investors had entrusted Neumann to build a global empire of office space for rent. WeWork’s valuation kept climbing, and Neumann seemed to be unstoppable. WeWork paid $126 million, not including performance bonuses, for Conductor last year. The deal would give Conductor cash to invest in research and development and double the size of that team. In return, Neumann gained a new channel of communication with Citigroup Inc., Salesforce.com Inc. and other Conductor customers right as WeWork was trying to recruit larger companies, which made up 25% of its membership at the time.The deal also reunited Besmertnik with Neumann, nearly two decades after they met as students at Baruch College in New York City. Both men dropped out to pursue business careers before returning later to earn degrees. Onstage at an industry conference a month after the acquisition, Besmertnik embraced Neumann, who greeted Conductor employees as family. “Welcome home,” Neumann said.Besmertnik said that while WeWork’s meltdown has been hard on the Conductor team, he’s grateful to have been a part of the company. Artie Minson, one of two men who replaced Neumann as CEO, praised Besmertnik in an emailed statement and said the divestiture is “a positive step forward for both WeWork and Conductor.” The buyout was partly financed by Besmertnik, along with Selina Eizik, the chief operating officer at Conductor, and Jason Finger, a founder of the Grubhub Inc.-owned food delivery app Seamless.Speaking from his New York office, which is lined with action figures and features a whiteboard covered in inspirational quotes (“The world is a reflection of you.”), Besmertnik said he’s focused on enforcing a strong company culture and a “people-first approach.” He hopes the new stock ownership program for employees sets an example for other businesses to follow, he said: “I’ve always felt the system wasn’t fair. If there happens to be a new CEO or a new board that doesn’t have the same willingness to fight for the people, employees stand to get the short end of the stick.”(Updates with Spacious closure in the third paragraph.)To contact the author of this story: Candy Cheng in San Francisco at ccheng86@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",WeWork Sells Conductor Unit Back to the Founder

2019-12-13,"People generally assume that a dividend stock has to have a high starting yield to generate lots of income. This is a mistaken assumption. In fact, you often earn more income over the long-run buying a fast-growing company with a low starting dividend yield, than one with a large current yield but minimal growth prospects.Think about capital allocation for a second. When a company has many ways to grow its business internally, it generally shouldn't pay a huge dividend. As shareholders, you get more value from the company opening more stores, factories, and whatnot to grow the business. Frequently, by the time a company starts paying a huge dividend, it is a sign of a corporation getting up there in years; the company no longer has tons of vigor to keep expanding. A mature company can pay large dividends for decades, but it won't have jaw-dropping earnings and dividend upside any more.  * These 7 S&P 500 Stocks Will Deliver a Repeat Performance in the Next Decade Oftentimes, the best way to get a dividend yield is by buying a company as it is just starting to transition from all-out growth toward stable maturity. You get a company that has started to pay a dividend, but still has plenty of opportunities to reinvest in their business and keep earnings moving sharply higher. Let's start looking at these underappreciated dividend growth machines with arguably the decade's most iconic example.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (AAPL)  * Dividend growth since 2009: Dividend payments began in 2012  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 10.2%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $5,605Source: George Dolgikh / Shutterstock.com Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the decade's most impressive dividend stories. Previously, Apple had last paid a dividend way back in 1995. As the company's fortunes faded, it had to suspend its dividend altogether during the lean years. After the turn of the century, the outlook started to improve with the iPod and subsequent new product launches.For years, Apple piled up more profits and cash as iPhone sales exploded. In 2012, the company realized that it was running out of great new growth opportunities, and the company's treasury was overflowing. So, after a 17-year drought, Apple kicked off paying a healthy sum out to shareholders once again.They launched with a $1.51 per year dividend in 2012, and have steadily hiked it since then. Impressively, despite not starting a dividend payout until 2012, if you had invested $10,000 at the end of 2009, you'd have already gotten back $5,605 in dividends on your starting investment. The yield-on-cost -- that is to say your annual yield on your starting investment -- topped 10% as well. Income investors that skipped AAPL stock a decade ago because it didn't pay a dividend ended up missing one of the 2010's best yield plays. Visa (V)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 26.1% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 5.5%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $2,295Source: Shutterstock Credit card network giant Visa (NYSE:V) launched its Initial Public Offering in 2008. Despite the inopportune timing to go public, Visa stock has been a nearly-instantaneous winner for its investors. Despite that, it didn't initially appear to be much of a dividend-paying stock. Visa paid just 11 cents per share in dividends in 2009; that calculated out to just a 0.5% dividend yield based on Visa's then-$22 stock price.Times have changed though. For one, Visa's stock is up almost 10x over the past decade and now trades around $180. Visa's dividend payments are up by a similar amount, with the annual payout jumping from 11 cents a year to a dollar a year per share.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade The company's success comes from several factors. For one, it only has one true global competitor, Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Other rivals have failed to achieve the necessary scope to really compete. Also, the purchase of Visa Europe a few years ago was a great move that provided more growth runway than investors had expected. Though disruption may eventually come from newer financial payment technologies, for now, Visa remains an unexpected dividend growth stock superstar. Nike (NKE)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 13.3% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 6.1%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $3,402Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Just over the past year or so, apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) has started to get some attention as a leading dividend growth stock. The company is well-positioned internationally, as it has grown sales in China and other key emerging markets. This has helped Nike post double-digit EPS growth for years and has led to a sharply rising Nike stock price.Long-time Nike stock owners will know that the company has been increasingly generous with its dividends as well. Like numerous stocks on this list, Nike never looked like much of a dividend payer, as its current annual yield is usually around 1%. That's right in line with where it is now; Nike pays 1.02% at the moment.So how has Nike delivered such compelling dividend growth over the past decade? Simple: it compounds. By growing the dividend at more than 13% per year, a starting 1% yield quickly becomes so much more. In fact, if you bought $10,000 of Nike stock a decade ago, you're now getting $610 per year in income. Additionally, you've earned back more than a third of your starting investment in dividends cumulatively. Let Nike be an example of the power of a fast-growing dividend to pile up plenty of wealth in just one decade. Texas Instruments (TXN)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 20.4% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 13.8%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $5,787Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com If you think of superstar tech stocks, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) probably wouldn't be the first name that comes to mind. But the Dallas-based firm has become a mega-successful semiconductor firm in its own right.TXN stock has surged from less than $25 per share in 2009 to $125 now. And it has managed tremendous dividend growth as well, as it has put up a compounded growth rate of more than 20% per year. It has one of the most impressive dividend stories of America's large-cap stocks, in fact. Had you bought $10,000 worth of Texas Instruments at the end of 2009, you'd have already received back nearly $6,000 today. On top of that, you'd be getting $1,380 dollar a year in dividends going forward off your initial $10,000, which makes for a whopping 14% yield on cost.How has Texas Instruments managed this feat? It's due to three separate mechanisms. For one, the company has matured and slowed down growth, instead ratcheting up its dividend payout ratio. It's a classic example of the process I discussed at the top of this article where a company converts from aggressive expansion to a more balanced approach. Where it has grown, it has done so strategically, focusing on long-life semiconductor chips for applications such as sensors and automobiles where there is less competition than in other categories such as cell phones, CPUs, or memory chips.  * 7 Energy Stocks That Are Still Worth Buying In 2020 Finally, Texas Instruments has utilized fantastic capital allocation. The company was quick to take advantage of low interest rates, issuing billions in debt earlier this decade for interest rates of less than 2%. It used this to buy back stock, driving up EPS and allowing it to pay a much larger dividend on its remaining outstanding shares. This combination of smart expansion and crafty financial dealings allowed Texas Instruments to be one of the decade's top growth and income stocks. Estee Lauder (EL)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 19.0% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 7.9%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $4,218Source: Shutterstock Luxury cosmetics company Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) checks a lot of the same boxes as Nike. Like Nike, Estee Lauder has enjoyed unmatched success in China, Hong Kong, and other key Asian markets. Like Nike, EL is benefiting from a huge wave of global prosperity and rising consumer spending in almost every corner of the world. And like Nike, Estee Lauder benefits from international media.Nike has its amazingly effective athlete endorsements to sell product. Meanwhile, Estee Lauder has tapped into Instagram culture to sell more makeup and cosmetics products than ever before.While Nike is more of a household name for many investors, Estee Lauder has managed to top its consumer goods peer in dividend growth. Impressively, Estee Lauder has put up 19%/year dividend growth such that its generally low current dividend yield has exploded into an absolute income machine over the past decade. Shares purchased ten years ago now pay nearly 8% per year, and an initial $10,000 investment has kicked out more than $4,200 in dividends already.And the good times should keep on rolling, as Estee Lauder has numerous tailwinds at its back. The rise of global travel in particular is of great benefit, as Estee Lauder sells a remarkable amount of products in airport shops; turns out people with spending money are eager to buy expensive products during their vacations. And that, in turn, will put even more dividends in Estee Lauder stockowners' pockets in coming years. Hormel Foods (HRL)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 16.9% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 8.8%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $5,057Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Income investors tend to love the food and beverages sector. There are plenty of iconic American companies in this category, and many of them have paid rising dividends for decades on end. What's less-known, however, is that the smaller, more dynamic food companies often top the bigger ones.A beverage stock like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is widely known and loved. No less a super-investor than Warren Buffett is a huge fan. Yet KO stock delivered a rather ordinary decade of dividends. It grew its dividend at just 7%/year compounded, and offers a yield-on-cost of 6% if you bought in 2009.Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, Wholly Guacamole, and a wide range of other foods has easily topped staid giants like Coca-Cola. Hormel grew its dividend by nearly 17% per year over the past decade, and investors that bought in 2009 are now getting a 9% annual dividend on their purchase. Impressively, anyone that bought then has now gotten back more than half their starting investment in dividends.  * 7 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Now What's the key to Hormel's success? The company has tons of organic growth; it has more than tripled revenues and earnings this decade. That far eclipses most food and beverage rivals. Also, the company's debt-free balance sheet means it doesn't have to pay interest, freeing up more money for dividends. Broadridge Financial (BR)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 17.3% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 8%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $4,671Source: Shutterstock Broadridge Financial (NYSE:BR) is probably the least-known company on this list. Which goes to show that you can get fantastic dividend growth from smaller and less famous companies.While Broadridge isn't a household name, you've almost certainly used its services. That's because the company dominates proxies, which is how corporations communicate with us shareholders. When you get mail or digital communications about annual meetings, shareholders votes, or any other such matter, Broadridge is usually the service provider. The company provides additional financial services such as operating automatic dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) for shareholders.Maybe not the world's most exciting business, but it is a vital one. Get anything wrong, and investors would be infuriated. So companies and brokerages have little incentive to switch service providers to save a tiny sum of money compared to the potential downside from dissatisfied customers. Meanwhile, the need for these functions continues regardless of how the economy is going; Broadridge's earnings fell less than 5% even during the Great Financial Crisis.The company's indispensable services and strong cash flow have made it a champion dividend payer. It grew dividends more than 17%/year last decade, and is now paying out 8%/year of dividends on an initial 2009 investment. With the company now moving into software for wealth management services, investors should expect Broadridge's latest expansion efforts to lead to even more income growth over the next decade.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned TXN, EL, HRL, and BR shares.

The S&P 500 is up 29%, the Dow Jones average is up 22%, and the tech-heavy NASDAQ index has gained an impressive 35%. Stocks are on the rise, and it’s looking like the sky is the limit.There have been several factors behind the stock market’s sharp gains. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve began a modest run of rate-cut movements, pushing down bond yields. Also, while the US and Chinese governments have been at loggerheads over trade and tariffs, both countries have maintained contacts through the year and kept up negotiations for a trade settlement – which now appear to be bearing fruit. Also to the credit of the Trump Administration, low corporate taxes and a commitment to freer trade generally are positive for the markets.So, with markets up and stocks clearly the way to go for investors seeking returns, the question is, Which stocks will make the best investments?

Here we ran a screen on all the stocks in the Dow Jones- and then sorted the results from the most to least bullish according to the Street.As you can see these 3 stocks all boast a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus based on ratings published by analysts over the last three months. Here’s why these are the three favorite Dow stocks of analysts right now:Chevron Corporation (CVX)Lower oil prices – an ongoing problem for the energy industry – have put pressure on Chevron, one of the world’s largest oil production companies. Even with lower prices, Chevron pulled in over $14 billion in net income last year, and is on track to exceed $10 billion this year.The decline in income is clear in the EPS, which for Q3 showed a 6% estimate miss, coming in at $1.36. Revenues also missed the forecast, by 4%, and came in at $36.12 billion. These numbers reflect the fact that crude oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average of $47 per barrel in the quarter, down from $62 in the year-ago quarter. Lower prices offset a 3% increase in production.Even with revenue and income down, however, CVX shares registered a 10% gain this year. The necessity of energy – and oil in particular – to today’s economy boosts the oil companies, ensuring steady income even against serious headwinds. And steady income allows the energy companies to sweeten their pot for investors with strong dividends. CVX pays out $4.76 per share annualized, giving a yield of 3.96% at current share prices. This yield is almost double the average among S&P listed companies.Well Fargo analyst Roger Read sees CVX as a Buy proposition, pointing out that further regulatory restrictions in California are not likely to hit the company very hard. Read notes that CVX derives only 5% of its current total production numbers from California. He believes the company will outperform the markets in the next twelve months, and sets a $142 price target. His target indicates potential for an 18% upside. (To see Read’s track record, click here)CVX’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 6 Buys and 2 Holds set in the past two months. The stock’s $138.88 average price target suggests an upside potential of 15% from the current $120 trading price. (See Chevron’s stock analysis at TipRanks)Visa, Inc. (V)At a market cap of over $420 billion, Visa is the second-largest credit card processor in the world. The company handles well over 100 billion transactions annually, totaling more than $7 trillion. Like several of its industry peers, Visa does not actually issue the cards with its logo; the company licenses the Visa name and processes the transactions run on those cards.Good economic times, and high consumer spending, have benefited Visa, and the company has shown strong growth. V shares are up 43% this year, outpacing the broader markets by a wide margin. The company’s fiscal Q4 report showed EPS above expectations and a 13% year-over-year revenue gain.Even better, for investors, Visa combines strong stock performance with a modest dividend. The yield, at just 0.63%, is nothing to write home about, but the annualized payment of $1.20 represents a steady extra income for shareholders, and Visa has been steadily raising that payment over the past several years.The analysts are impressed by V, and are clear in their comments on the stock. BMO Capital’s James Fotheringham writes, “[The] Q4 earnings beat and encouraging FY20 guidance driven by improved incentives, reduced operating costs, and lower assumed tax rate, [and] encouraging FY20 guidance [keep this stock our] top recommendation among U.S.financial technology, large-cap banks, specialty lenders, and asset manager companies.”Fotheringham backs his Buy on V with a $239 price target, suggesting a 26% upside. (To watch Fotheringham’s track record, click here)Visa’s Strong Buy rating comes from a unanimous analyst consensus. Eight analysts have given this stock the seal of approval in the past few months. Shares are expensive, at $189, but the reward is clear: the average price target of $211 gives the stock an 11.5% upside potential. (See Visa’s stock analysis at TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Like visa, UNH is a giant – in fact, it is the world’s largest health insurer. The company faces a potentially serious headwind in the emerging platform positions of the Democratic Presidential candidates, who are coalescing around an anti-private insurance position, but its dominance of the current market has allowed it to register an 18% gain this year. UNH’s strong market position is built on a customer base exceeding 115 million people, and revenues over $220 billion annually.UNH sees further growth ahead, despite the Dems’ political movement toward single payer. The company’s Q3 earnings report showed strong growth, with revenues up 7% year-over-year to $60.4 billion and EPS, at $3.88, up 13.8% from the year-ago quarter. Management was clearly pleased with the results, and raised full-year EPS guidance to the $14.90 to $15.00 range.UNH offers a dividend yield of 1.46%, and the high share price puts the quarterly payment at $1.08. This helps make up for the stock’s relatively low upside potential.5-star analyst David Toung, of Argus Research, is bullish on UNH and recently reiterated his Buy rating for the stock. He writes, “…the company's earnings growth in 2021 could reach 20% thanks to the expected permanent repeal of the Health Insurer Fee tax. With strong top-line growth coming from the company's UnitedHealthcare and Optum operating segments in Q3, [we] also remain positive on solid execution by UnitedHealth management driving its future growth.” Toung gives UNH a price target of $340, indicating confidence in a 15% upside. (To watch Toung’s track record, click here)Overall, UNH has 20 analyst reviews, including 17 Buys, supporting its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are not for budget investors, as they are priced at $295. The average price target, $312, suggests an upside of just 5.4%, perhaps reflecting downward pressure from political worries. But as Toung’s comments show, there is reason to believe that the average upside is understated. (See UnitedHealth’s stock analysis on TipRanks)",3 Dow Jones Stocks Worth a Second Look

2020-01-02,"2019 was a banner year, as we saw record high after record high. What drove the indices higher? Let's look the top stock trades from 2019, and specifically, the top five performers from the Dow. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: United Technologies (UTX)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUnited Technologies (NYSE:UTX) was the fifth-best performer in the group, up 41% in 2019. After struggling with the $142 area in late October, UTX gapped up over this mark in November.Later in the month, it actually pulled back and retested this former resistance levels. This time, though, it acted as support, a clear sign that bulls were in control. Unlike some of the stronger performers on the list below, UTX does not have as well-defined of an uptrend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNotably, though, buyers have been stepping in around the 50-day moving average, giving bulls one significant point of reference. With shares above $150 -- resistance in November and support in December -- it's hard to be bearish on UTX, which hit a new high on Thursday.  * 7 Strong Retail Stocks Still Worth a Look Below the 50-day could send it back down to range support around $142. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Visa (V)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUp 42% in 2019, Visa (NYSE:V) just barely nudged out UTX for No. 4 on the list. Unlike the rest of the market, Visa didn't begin barreling higher until just a few weeks ago.After hitting a high of $183.50 in July, Visa slowly but surely plowed higher. In November and early December, it had a solid uptrend guiding it higher (blue line), before erupting over $184, then $186.It's now in a steeper uptrend channel (purple lines) and continues to climb. Surprisingly, shares are not overbought like many others, so buyers could continue to push this name higher.At this point, I would not bet against Visa if the stock is above the 20-day moving average. Below puts uptrend support, $184 and the 50-day moving average on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: JPMorgan (JPM)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comJust one percentage point above Visa, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) rang up gains of 43% in 2019. JPM had struggled with the $114 to $116 area for almost two years. In October, the bank burst over this mark, and hasn't looked back since.Shares hit a new high on Thursday, breaching the $140 level. Now what?JPMorgan is a buy-the-dips stock until bulls are proven wrong. This one has been very strong over the past few months and expecting it to continue forever is unrealistic. But for now, dips to the 20-day moving average have been bought aggressively.Until this mark fails to buoy JPMorgan, bulls can continue to buy on pullbacks to it. Below the $137 to $138 area, and the tone will shift more cautious -- note: not bearish, but cautious. Below the 20-day moving average and $137, and the 50-day moving average is next. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comUp 55% on the year, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the second-best Dow stock this year.After consolidating between $132 and $142 for about five months, shares gapped up and over the range, and have been trending higher since. Like JPM, dips to the 20-day moving average have been bought aggressively by the bulls.Until that trend changes, we shouldn't bet against it. Flirting with $160 now, MSFT is trying to break out again. If it does, look for a continued run higher. If it can't muster the strength to hurdle $150, see that uptrend support (blue line) and the 20-day moving average support the stock.Below puts the $152.50 area on watch, with the 50-day moving average just below that. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: Apple (AAPL)Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comThese last two are the most impressive to me. Not only do Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) command $2.5 trillion worth of equity, but they are both up incredible amounts this year. The combined rally between the two of them added $1.13 trillion to their market caps!That's such a remarkable figure, it's hard to comprehend. Let's put it this way, AAPL and MSFT's gains total more than the market caps of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) … combined.Apple was the best performer in the Dow last year, up a resounding 86%. I love Apple, but if you took a pass at $150 in January 2018 or $190 in August, I would not suggest $290-plus as being the time to buy.Shares sport an overbought condition (blue circle) and while they can continue higher from here, we need a better dip to buy before getting long. That starts with a correction down to the 20-day moving average and/or the $280 level. Below that and uptrend support (blue line), and the 50-day moving average should buoy the stock.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL, AMZN, V and ROKU.

2020-01-06,"Financial commentators tend to lean bullish on Square (NYSE:SQ) stock as a targeted bet on the future growth of digital payments. I see this as a perfectly reasonable position, as millennials seem willing to give Square's Cash App a chance in a sphere once entirely dominated by the likes of Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).Source: Shutterstock However, I believe there's more to the story.Millennials and other demographic segments are becoming more aware of cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin (BTC) in particular. So, unlike the stodgy, payment-processing companies that have hesitated to embrace Bitcoin as a viable currency, Square is preparing for a blockchain-powered world right now. With that said, a position in Square stock could be a serious moneymaker if this gambit succeeds.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Love Bitcoin? Then You Should Like Square Stock TooWhen I'm on Internet forums, I sometimes get the feeling that investors divide into two mutually exclusive camps; Those who invest in stocks, and those who buy or &quot;HODL&quot; (hold on for dear life) cryptocurrency. The dividing line isn't necessarily generational, but I've observed that younger investors seem more willing to give crypto a chance.There's something to be said for the safety of investing in long-standing Dow Jones components like Visa and Mastercard. However, now that millennials are America's biggest generation population-wise, investors need to understand that point-of-sale payment processing has changed; and so has the way people perceive money itself.  * 9 Boring Stocks to Buy You Should Never Let Go Of The U.S. dollar has lost much of its value over the years. With that, Bitcoin has become an attractive alternative currency to open-minded consumers. In this regard, Square got a big head start compared to its old-school rivals. As early as November of 2017, the company's Cash App allowed its users to buy and sell Bitcoin.Not everyone wants to open up a Coinbase or Binance account. Therefore, I feel that early Bitcoin integration was a savvy move on Square's part. The numbers bear this out, as Square's third quarter 2019 Bitcoin sales totaled an impressive $148 million. This represents a 20% increase in volume quarter-over-quarter, as well as a massive 245% year-over-year increase. A Job Ad Provides CluesAs a financial reporter, sometimes I gather information from interesting and unexpected sources. In this instance, I discovered a job advertisement on LinkedIn that teases a number of potentially new Bitcoin-friendly Cash App features. If these pan out, Square could end up being miles ahead of Visa and Mastercard in the crypto-integration department.Along with a six-figure salary range and a daunting list of job requirements that would disqualify 99.99% of the population, the employment ad signals Square's eagerness to add Bitcoin functionality to the Cash App in 2020:&quot;The Cash App continues to push the boundaries in finance and Bitcoin sits at the very forefront of these efforts. Cash App's large and ever-expanding network of customers uniquely positions us to add utility to BTC and to bring Bitcoin to the masses in a user-friendly way.&quot;Square investors already sensed the company's crypto-friendly vision. But, it's still nice to hear it stated so forcefully -- and with a tone of commitment that I haven't heard from Visa or Mastercard. However, it's the next part of the job ad that indicated the Cash App's potential upcoming perks:&quot;[The chosen job candidate] will own the Crypto Investing product and be entirely responsible for growing its adoption in whatever ways you see fit, which could include tried and true growth tactics, new functionality (e.g. limit orders, auto-invest), or building entirely new features like BTC gifting (P2P).&quot;Whether these Cash App features are actually built out in 2020 is immaterial. Square stock investors, if they're also Bitcoin devotees, should be excited at the prospect of peer-to-peer (P2P) BTC gifting and auto-invest functionality.Call me a visionary or a nut, but I can easily imagine a time in the near future when payment processors will have to integrate these types of Bitcoin-friendly features. The fact that Square wants to move in this direction at this early stage is, to me, highly encouraging. The Takeaway on Square StockMaybe you like Bitcoin and maybe you don't; I can see the merit of both sides of the argument. Overall though, if you're willing to keep an open mind concerning Bitcoin's potential to transform the way we use money, then you might consider &quot;HODLing&quot; some BTC; and while you're at it, some Square stock too.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Gas stations around the U.S. are rushing to upgrade fuel pumps to accept credit and debit cards with chips after Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. rejected a request to delay a looming deadline to complete the work.Beginning in October, station operators that haven’t modernized their pumps will face liability for any card fraud that happens at their businesses. The industry is “massively under-prepared,” said Joshua Smith, chief executive officer of Gas Pos, which sells point-of-sale systems.“There’s not enough technicians to do the installments,” Smith said. “There’s not enough inventory. Even if there were enough contractors, there’s not enough dispensers available.”Most retailers began to upgrade payment systems in 2015 -- the first of a series of deadlines set by Visa and Mastercard as the U.S. worked to catch up with nations in Europe and Asia that had long adopted the more-secure chip cards. For fuel retailers, the deadline was ultimately pushed back five years as the industry faced costs of more than $3.9 billion to do the work.In a 2019 survey by Conexxus, a non-profit that represents convenience stores, almost 70% of respondents who own a convenience store said they haven’t upgraded any outside pumps to the new so-called EMV technology.Few companies manufacture the required pumps. Those that do -- such as Dover Corp. or Fortive Corp.’s Gilbarco Veeder-Root -- have said they’re expecting an increase in sales ahead of the deadline. Once the hardware is installed, fuel companies must have the pump software certified.Fuel retailers that don’t upgrade could face costs of as much as $201,000 per store over the next seven years, according to data compiled by Conexxus. The group expects the fuel industry to suffer $451 million of card fraud in 2020 alone.“There’s going to be quite a surprise come October,” Laura Townsend, senior vice president of the Merchant Advisory Group, said in an interview. “Folks that have been trying to transition to EMV will be unable to because of things outside their control. But they will bear a significant increase in losses either come October or shortly thereafter because we know fraudsters will find the weakest link.”In the Conexxus survey, more than half of participants cited a lack of available software for not having chip technology fully deployed, while about 15% pointed to a shortage of hardware. The convenience-store industry blames Visa and Mastercard for not consulting them when setting deadlines.“The payment standard-setting process needs to be more open,” said Anna Ready Blom, director of government relations for NACS, a trade association for the convenience-store industry. “Retailers and technology companies should have been part of the planning and decision-making on chip cards from the start. If they had been, rather than Visa and Mastercard making all the decisions without understanding them fully, we wouldn’t be in this mess.”Visa has previously highlighted its discussions with merchants when it announced its decision to extend the deadline for gas station operators in 2016.Visa and Mastercard aren’t willing to give gas stations more time. The networks recently rejected a plea for a delay from the Merchant Advisory Group, which helps retailers navigate payment-systems issues.“We believe extending chip technology to fuel pumps is an important step to take to protect businesses and consumers who want to pay securely as well as conveniently,” Visa said in a statement. Mastercard said it’s seeing good adoption of EMV technology and a reduction in fraud.Visa and Mastercard began calling for a migration to chips years ago to head off counterfeit-card fraud. The underlying technology -- called EMV for founders Europay, Mastercard and Visa -- generates new codes for each transaction, while the information on magnetic stripes is permanent and can be copied and stored by hackers.More than 3.7 million merchants -- or 80% of U.S. storefronts -- currently accept chip cards. Since 2015, the amount of money merchants lost to counterfeit fraud has declined by 62%, according to Visa.As gas stations start to make the switch, they’re also facing an increased threat from hackers looking to take advantage of one of the last industries that remains vulnerable to counterfeit-card fraud.“As long as the magnetic stripe readers are in place, fuel dispenser merchants are becoming an increasingly attractive target for advanced threat actors,” Visa said in a security alert issued in November. It recommended these merchants deploy chip acceptance along with other security measures such as encryption and educating employees about phishing attacks.(Updates with Visa’s comments in 11th paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Iran is assessing 13 scenarios to respond to the U.S. killing of Qassem Soleimani, the influential general in charge of foreign operations, and even the weakest of those options would be a “historic nightmare” for the U.S., Ali Shamkhani, the head of Iran’s national security council, was quoted as saying by Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency.The countdown has begun for the U.S.’s exit from the Middle East, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday in Tehran, warning of war that would last for generations if the region continued to rely on America’s presence. Zarif spoke as the funeral procession for Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Friday, moved to Soleimani’s home town of Kerman.In Germany, lawmaker Roderich Kiesewetter said some German troops would be temporarily withdrawn from Iraq. In Lebanon, the U.S. embassy tightened security in anticipation of Iranian retaliation, according to a local newspaper.Key Developments:U.S. denies Iraq exit after errant letterIranian threat ends upbeat start for marketsIran’s parliament passes a bill designating Pentagon as “terrorists”Stampede Reported at Soleimani’s Funeral (1:20 p.m.)A stampede erupted at the funeral procession and an unspecified number of people have been killed or injured, AP reports, citing Iranian state TV.

U.S. equity futures pared gains, while Treasuries and gold reversed declines.Earlier, stocks posted strong gains across Asia amid a general easing of concern about the situation in the Middle East.Shamkhani Says Iran’s Response Will Be ‘Historic Nightmare’ for U.S. (11:30 a.m.)“Even if the weakest of these scenarios gains a consensus, the implementation of it can be a historic nightmare for the Americans,” Ali Shamkhani, head of Iran’s national security council, is cited as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. “For now, for intelligence reasons, we cannot provide more information to the media,” he says.Iran is assessing 13 scenarios for retaliation, Shamkhani was cited as saying. “The entirety of the resistance forces will retaliate” for Soleimani’s killing, he says.Zarif Says He’ll Attend Davos (11 a.m.)Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reported, citing organizers of the meeting. A spokesman for the event, which will be held from Jan. 21 to Jan. 24, wasn’t immediately available to comment. The news comes after Zarif was denied a visa to travel to New York for meetings at the United Nations, according to a person familiar with the matter on Monday evening. The person said the U.S. had to take certain precautions after Soleimani’s killing.As part of its agreement to host the UN headquarters, the U.S. is obligated to approve visas for official travel to the global body.The U.S. and Iranian missions to the UN didn’t immediately reply to questions about the status of the visa request.Zarif Says Regional War Could Drag On ‘for Generations’ (10:55 a.m.)Speaking in Tehran, Zarif said the Middle East will have to deal with war “for generations” if it relies on the U.S.The countdown has begun for America’s exit from the region, he said.Germany to Temporarily Withdraw Some Troops (10:45 a.m.)Germany will temporarily move some troops from Iraq who were taking part in a training mission there, according to a lawmaker from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party.Of Germany’s 120 soldiers in Iraq, between 30 and 40 will transfer to Jordan, CDU lawmaker Roderich Kiesewetter said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio. The mission will continue, although it has been suspended for the time being, Kiesewetter added.“Of course, if the Iraqi government decides that all foreign troops should withdraw it would affect the training mission and have grave consequences for the fight against IS,” Kiesewetter said. “We would be well advised to make it clear to the Iraqi government what it would mean if 67 states withdrew from the whole region.”U.S. Embassy in Lebanon Tightens Security (10:45 a.m.)The U.S. embassy in Beirut is waiting for security backup from American military forces in Italy in anticipation that Iran will retaliate for the killing of its most powerful general, the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper reported.It’s unclear whether the backup will arrive by air or sea, an unidentified military official familiar with the matter told the London-based newspaper.U.S. Forces Designated as “Terrorists” by Iranian Lawmakers (10:30 a.m.)Parliament in Tehran passed a bill in retaliation to U.S. actions, according to ICANA, the legislative body’s official news service.Under the legislation, which expands a previous bill that blacklisted U.S. Central Command, “all members of the Pentagon and related companies, as well as actors and commanders involved in the martyrdom of Qassem Soleimani, are designated in the list of terror groups.”Earlier:Trump Vows Sanctions on Ally Iraq, Toughens Rhetoric on Iran (1)Europeans Scramble to Work Out What They Can Do About Iran (2)Forwards Traders Raise Speculative Bets Against Gulf CurrenciesTrump Threat to Attack Iran’s Cultural Treasures Spurs BacklashIran Says Not Bound by Nukes Deal in New Soleimani Fallout (4)&#92;--With assistance from Arsalan Shahla, Richard Bravo, Nikos Chrysoloras, David Wainer, Laura Litvan and Tony Capaccio.To contact the reporter on this story: Benjamin Harvey in Dubai at bharvey11@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at wfaries@bloomberg.net;Lin Noueihed at lnoueihed@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Iran Assessing 13 Retaliation Scenarios for U.S.: Iran Update
2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil retreated after its dramatic start to the year as the uninterrupted flow of Middle East supplies tempered fears over the fallout from the U.S. airstrike that killed a top Iranian general.Futures in London fell on Tuesday after two days of wild trading that pushed prices briefly above $70 a barrel for the first time since September. While Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency said the Islamic Republic is assessing 13 retaliation ‘scenarios’ against the U.S., and the White House ordered additional forces to the Middle East, immediate concerns that a deeper conflict could disrupt output or exports from the region are yet to materialize.It’s been a turbulent start to 2020 for the oil market after the U.S. airstrikes sparked an escalation in hostilities between Washington and Tehran, reigniting fears of conflict in the world’s most important producing region. Crude remains about 3% higher since the attack, but futures are pulling back as the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says it’ll take a major disruption to output to keep prices elevated.“The market is recovering from the initial shock and closely monitoring how Tehran will respond,” said Will Sungchil Yun, commodities analyst at VI Investment Corp. “As current signals indicate traders and investors don’t see a full-blown war coming, prices are likely to remain relatively steady without a significant development.”Brent crude dropped 48 cents, or 0.7%, to $68.43 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange as of 7:55 a.m. in London. The contract ended Monday just 0.5% higher after earlier rising as much as 3.1% in intraday trade. West Texas Intermediate futures lost 40 cents, or 0.6%, to $62.87 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Goldman Sachs said this week there’s a greater risk of prices falling in coming weeks and being long gold is a better hedge than oil for geopolitical risks.Oil markets still have a comfortable supply cushion should there be a disruption. OPEC is sitting on huge amounts of spare capacity after reducing supplies for most of the past three years and the U.S. recently reported its first months as a net exporter of petroleum for the first time in roughly 75 years.Consuming countries from the U.S. to China also control millions of barrels stored in strategic petroleum reserves that can be deployed to offset any shortage.Jitters RemainStill, oil investors remain jittery about Iran’s response after the U.S. warned of a risk of attacks in Saudi Arabia, particularly in the eastern province and near the Yemeni border close to military bases as well as oil and gas facilities. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed “severe retaliation” after the killing of General Qassem Soleimani, and Fars reported that even the weakest scenario could cause a “historic nightmare” for the U.S., citing Ali Shamkhani, the head of the nation’s security council.An upbeat start to trading faded for investors in other markets after Iran’s response to the killing of Soleimani. U.S. equity futures pared gains, while Treasuries and gold reversed earlier declines.Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq together pumped more than 16 million barrels of oil a day last month. Most of their exports leave the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that Iran has repeatedly threatened to shut down if there’s a war.Oil buyers are also wary that Iraq’s entanglement in the dispute could disrupt shipments from OPEC’s second-biggest producer. While there’s been no material threat to Iraq’s oil output, U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened heavy sanctions against the country if it followed through on a vote by parliament to expel foreign forces from its territory. The U.S. defense secretary has since insisted America hasn’t made a decision to leave the country.Meanwhile, the three-ship Bataan Amphibious Readiness Group, which includes about 2,200 marines and a helicopter unit, was ordered to move to the Persian Gulf region from where it was exercising in the Mediterranean, according to a U.S. official.To contact the reporter on this story: Sharon Cho in Singapore at ccho28@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Alexander KwiatkowskiFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Oil Slips After Wild Ride Triggered by U.S.-Iran Hostilities
2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last summer, when the Trump administration threatened sanctions on Javad Zarif, I argued that this placed too much importance on the Iranian foreign minister. He is, after all, a mere cipher in the Islamic Republic, a glorified spokesman for a regime where real authority is wielded by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Now that there’s a small chance of Zarif gaining an ounce of political weight in Tehran, it is doubly foolish of the U.S. to deny him a visa to attend a meeting Thursday of the United Nations Security Council. And that’s quite apart from the fact that such a ban runs contrary to the UN headquarters agreement of 1947, which requires the U.S. to allow foreign diplomats to visit the multilateral body.A little background: Although Zarif has been the titular head of the foreign ministry since 2013, he has had little real power in setting policy. He was appointed to the post for the same reason Khamenei allowed Hassan Rouhani to win the presidential election that year: as window-dressing for a regime seeking to make a deal with the West.Like Rouhani, Zarif had been Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator and had a reputation for charming Western interlocutors, in stark contrast to the dour, sour officials who characterized the administration of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Zarif had also been the Islamic Republic’s ambassador to the UN, where he was said to have developed useful friendships with influential Americans and an acute understanding of U.S. politics.These qualifications made Rouhani and Zarif the perfect instruments for Khamenei’s top priority: to free Iran from the noose of international economic sanctions over its nuclear program. The two delivered on this with the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.From that moment, Zarif’s utility to the supreme leader began to depreciate. Khamenei’s other foreign-policy priorities involved the expansion of Iran’s influence in its neighborhood, by destabilizing governments and promoting mayhem through terrorist groups and proxy militias. Zarif’s charm and credentials as a nuclear negotiator were of no value in this theater; this was a job for Khamenei’s main man in the Middle East, Qassem Soleimani.Since May 2018, when President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the JCPOA and reinstated economic sanctions on Iran, Zarif’s role has been, in the main, to try to persuade the agreement’s European signatories to keep their end of the bargain. He was never going to succeed: Europeans fear Trump’s sanctions more than they covet business opportunities in Iran. The low point of Zarif’s career came early last year, during a visit to Tehran by the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The foreign minister was not even invited to a meeting with Khamenei’s favorite tyrant. Needless to say, Soleimani was. Zarif pouted and issued a faux resignation — on Instagram, of all places — but allowed himself to be persuaded to stay. His growing frustration manifested in his progressively more tetchy tweets. He has dropped his diplomatic pose in favor of snark, labeling the Trump administration as “the B-team” and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “an arrogant clown.”This playing to Khamenei’s prejudices — and to the peanut gallery in Tehran — helped preserve Zarif’s job, despite strong criticism from elements of the regime who regard him as a failure.   Now, finally, things may be breaking his way. Soleimani’s death removes the main power player in foreign policy; his replacement as boss of the Quds Force, Esmail Ghaani, is at best an unknown quantity in that arena. Besides, Ghaani will have his hands full with the task of avenging the death of Khamenei’s favorite: If Iran does indeed have 13 retaliation scenarios, it’s a good bet that the majority of them will involve the Quds Force and the proxy groups that now fall under Ghaani’s authority. This might give Zarif some room to maneuver in foreign policy. And that room could expand if Khamenei decides to take the rational course and seek a detente with Iran’s neighbors and with the U.S. It would require Zarif to walk back some of his spiteful remarks and reprise his role as the regime’s charmer-in-chief, but this shouldn’t be difficult for a practiced chameleon.That’s why it makes no sense for the Trump administration to bar him from the U.S. or the UN. Yes, there is an industrial quantity of hypocrisy in the idea of having the mouthpiece of a genocidal regime address the Security Council on the topic of upholding the UN Charter — which enjoins members, among other things, “to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.” But hypocrisy is the UN’s stock-in-trade: just run your eyes down the list of members of the Human Rights Council.For the first time in years, Javad Zarif might actually matter: The Trump administration could not have picked a worse moment to make him a persona non grata.To contact the author of this story: Bobby Ghosh at aghosh73@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Stacey Shick at sshick@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Bobby Ghosh is a columnist and member of the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.

2020-01-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. and China UnionPay Co. will soon unify the mobile codes that consumers scan to pay for purchases, granting the Chinese central bank-backed network a bigger foothold in a $27 trillion payments arena.Tencent and UnionPay have agreed to integrate their QR code systems, allowing their respective customers to transfer or spend money using the same smartphone symbols, state media including Caixin reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources. A Tencent representative said the company is collaborating with UnionPay in a number of fields on a trial basis. A UnionPay representative declined to comment.The tie-up may help UnionPay, a network set up by top lenders from Bank of China to Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, carve out a bigger slice of a market long dominated by Tencent and Alipay, the digital wallet owned and operated by Jack Ma’s Ant Financial. Under the agreement, customers using UnionPay’s Quickpass or WeChat Pay -- the de facto payment service on Tencent’s ubiquitous messaging platform of the same name -- will scan the same QR code from merchants, Caixin reported.Alipay, which is part-owned by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., isn’t in similar integration talks, Caixin added. Once China’s dominant online payments provider thanks to its prominence on Alibaba’s online malls, Alipay has in recent years come under attack from Tencent’s rival offering, which is available to a billion-plus WeChat users.China’s central bank has pushed for system integration in mobile payments, both domestically and overseas. The EMVCo consortium, which includes UnionPay, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. as its members, created a QR Payment Mark to promote global payments unification in 2018.Read more: Alipay, Tencent Beware: China’s Digital Yuan Is Closing In(Updates with Tencent’s and UnionPay’s comments in the second paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Zheping Huang and Jun Luo.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Evelyn Yu in Shanghai at yyu263@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Candice Zachariahs at czachariahs2@bloomberg.net, Edwin Chan, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Tencent Teams With State-Backed UnionPay on Mobile Payments

2020-01-08,"Equities rebounded Wednesday despite a batch of Iran-related headlines last night after President Trump sounded a clear, decisive tone on dealing with the republic and as private payroll data for December gave investors hope the economy will remain sturdy in 2020.Source: Charts Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 surged 0.49%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.56%  * The Nasdaq Composite tacked on 0.67%  * On a day when risk was on, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), often viewed as a defensive name, was the Dow's best-performing name with a gain of 2.09%.On Tuesday evening, Iran launched missile strikes against U.S. military installations in Iraq. Fortunately, no casualties have been reported and there is some speculation that Iran missed on purpose. Still, those attacks, futile as they may have been, earned a stinging rebuke from the White House with President Trump promising swift retaliation for any attacks that cost American lives and new economic sanctions against Iran. As for the Tuesday night attacks, it appears U.S. forces were more than ready.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Trump's Tax Cut Truly Rewarded &quot;Most of Iran's missiles are liquid-fueled, which take longer to get ready for launch and are easier to spot.

The Labor Department releases its December jobs report Friday before the open of U.S. markets with economists expecting the addition of 160,000 roles. Boeing AgainIn late trading, 23 of the 30 Dow stocks were higher, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) wasn't one of them. Earlier today, a Boeing 737 passenger operated by a Ukranian airline crashed, killing the 167 passengers and nine crew members aboard, soon after departing the Iranian capital of Tehran.There is some speculation that this crash was the result of an engine failure, but as the crash occurred in Iranian territory and authorities from that country are in possession of the plane's black boxes, the world may never know the true cause of this unfortunate accident.Compounding Boeing's Wednesday woes, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr downgraded the stock to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy&quot; with a new price target of $371, down from $419. Walgreens WoesAs I noted yesterday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was scheduled to report earnings this morning and the company did just that. However, investors may have wished the pharmacy operator kept quiet because the report resulted in a 5.84% decline for the stock, by far the worst performance in the Dow Jones today.Walgreens said it earned $1.37 per share on sales of $34.34 billion, but analyst were expecting earnings of $1.41 a share on revenue of $34.60 billion.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt's not too late for fun and informative historical trends and anecdotes that could be relevant this year. The S&P 500 notched 150 up days last year, a rare occurrence to be sure. In five previous years of that happening, the benchmark U.S. equity gauge finished higher on an annual basis the following year four times, according to Schaeffer's Investment Research.Hopefully, that trend repeats in 2020.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. grew into one of the world’s most valuable financial companies by serving as the pipes that help connect banks and merchants.Now, it’s making a major bet on doing the same for data between banks and financial startups.Visa agreed to pay $5.3 billion for Plaid, a fintech firm that connects popular apps like Venmo to customers’ data in the established banking system. The deal caps a meteoric rise for Plaid and aims to keep fueling Visa’s own ascent, which has seen its stock triple in the past five years. The sale price is double Plaid’s $2.65 billion valuation in a 2018 funding round.Plaid’s developer tools help power a range of popular financial apps -- such as Venmo, Coinbase Inc. and Acorns Grow Inc. -- by channeling the banking data they need for their apps and websites. Founded in 2012, the firm now has more than 200 million accounts linked on its platform, according to an investor presentation. That access underscores the demand from consumers to send their data to services that can move funds between accounts or into cryptocurrencies, give advice on personal finances or reimburse a friend after brunch.About a quarter of people with a U.S. bank account have used Plaid to connect to the roughly 11,000 financial institutions it works with, the companies said. At times, that’s put Plaid at the center of tensions between fintech disruptors and banks, which have expressed concerns about security and sometimes locked the outside parties out.Data Access“We don’t see changing Plaid’s model, we see helping them accelerate their growth,” Visa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said on a conference call about the way Plaid earns its fees.But the way data is shared probably will change, Visa President Ryan McInerney said in an interview. Visa will work with banking partners including JPMorgan Chase & Co. to ensure fintechs are collecting consumers’ data “appropriately,” he said. “We have deep relationships with most financial institutions and we intend to evolve” Plaid’s data practices, he said. As a benefit, fintechs may get more reliable connectivity.Plaid has attracted investments from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and venture capitalist Mary Meeker. Visa and Mastercard Inc. also are investors in the company, Plaid said last year in a blog post. Visa said it expects the takeover to close in the next three to six months with the acquisition adding 80 to 100 basis points to revenue growth in fiscal 2021.Longer-term, the deal will let Visa play a greater role in the financial industry’s tech-driven evolution, Kelly told analysts on a call. “We see this giving us options and growth potentials at least for the next decade,” he said.In 2018, Plaid had talks with Jack Dorsey’s Square Inc. about an acquisition that would have valued Plaid at about $1 billion. In early 2019, the firm announced that it was buying one of its competitors, Quovo, in a deal valued at about $200 million.Both Visa and Mastercard have been seeking to move beyond card payments in recent years to extend their rapid revenue growth. Mastercard bought a payments platform owned by Nets for $3.2 billion last year, using its biggest-ever acquisition to move further into so-called account-to-account payments.Plaid has struck data-sharing agreements with major banks including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co. over the past few years, seeking to head off battles over whether consumers should give up their bank username and password to share data with financial applications.Visa’s move follows a year of frenzied consolidation in the fintech industry, as old-guard companies increasingly seek to compete with fast-growing startups. In November, PayPal Holdings Inc. snapped up online coupon company Honey Science Corp. for $4 billion. Also last year, Charles Schwab acquired of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion, and Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and Global Payments Inc. did a series of major deals in payment processing.Plaid’s takeover by Visa -- seen by some fintech disruptors as part of the more traditional banking industry -- will be watched closely by Silicon Valley for any signs that more consolidation is coming. Monday’s announcement included comments from JPMorgan and PayPal welcoming the merger.(Updates with comments from Visa’s president on data policies in the seventh paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Anne VanderMey.To contact the reporters on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.net;Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

That and some earnings reports from marquee companies paved the way for modest upside for equities Wednesday.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 added 0.19%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.31%  * The Nasdaq Composite rose by 0.08%  * On the back of a strong earnings report, managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) led the Dow Jones today with a gain of 2.8%While some of the bloom of the trade deal rose wore off pretty quickly during the trading day, it cannot be argued that China is pledging to buy $200 billion worth of American goods to close the trade gap between the two countries and crack on technology intellectual property theft.  * 7 Socially Responsible ETFs to Buy in 2020 As a voracious consumer of commodities, China will purchase $52.4 billion worth of American energy products, including coal, natural gas and oil, over the next several years as part of the trade accord.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven with that news, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were not among the Dow winners today, but losses for the oil giants were minor.In late trading, about half of the Dow's 30 stocks were pointed higher. Onward And Upward For UnitedHealthAs noted above, UnitedHealth, the largest healthcare component in the Dow, was the index's leader today. UNH reported 2019 earnings of $15.11 per share, beating the recently upped guidance of $15 and easily topping its 2018 profit. UNH reiterated a 2020 forecast of between $16.25 and $16.55 per share.&quot;Return on equity of 25.7 percent in 2019 reflected the Company's strong overall operating performance and efficient capital structure. The debt to total capital ratio was 40.2 percent at December 31, 2019, full year dividend payments grew 18.4 percent year-over-year to $3.9 billion, and the Company repurchased 22.4 million shares for $5.5 billion in 2019,&quot; according to a statement issued by UNH.The company's Optum health services unit grew revenue by $11.7 billion or 11.5% year-over-year to $113.0 billion. Muted ReactionGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also stepped into the earnings confessional earlier today. Investors reaction to this report was much more subdued than what was seen yesterday with fellow Dow component JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).Goldman stock inched up on the day, but its fourth-quarter net income dropped to $1.72 billion, or $4.69 a share, from $2.32 billion, or $6.04 a share a year earlier. Revenue jumped 23% to $9.96 billion, indicating that the problem, by Goldman's own admission, was rising expenses, something the company said it's addressing. Everywhere You Want to BeVisa (NYSE:V) continued an impressive ascent that has seen the stock climb about 4% over the past week. Investors are rewarding the stock for the company's recent acquisition of fintech startup Plaid, a deal announced earlier this week.For conservative investors looking for fintech exposure, Visa and rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have shown themselves to be more than worthy options in a space where stock picking among smaller companies can be difficult for the uninitiated. After UnitedHealth, Visa was the Dow's second-best performer today.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10  Just Another Day For AppleAlbeit in modest fashion, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was again among the Dow winners on Wednesday after another analyst chimed with bullish commentary on the iPhone maker.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWe're still in the early innings of earning season and have some more big financial services reports to work through before getting to technology, the S&P 500's largest sector weight, but there's an important earnings theme emerging in that group investors should take note of.&quot;At the sector level, the Information Technology sector has the highest number of companies issuing EPS guidance for the quarter at 39,&quot; according to FactSet research. &quot;This is not unusual, as the Information Technology typically has the highest number of companies issuing EPS guidance each quarter.

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. The U.S. and China signed what they’re billing as the first phase of a broader trade pact on Wednesday amid persistent questions over whether President Donald Trump’s efforts to rewrite the economic relationship with Beijing will ever go any further.The deal commits China to do more to crack down on the theft of American technology and corporate secrets by its companies and state entities, while outlining a $200 billion spending spree to try to close its trade imbalance with the U.S. It also binds Beijing to avoiding currency manipulation to gain an advantage and includes an enforcement system to ensure promises are kept.Read the full text of the agreement here.The ceremony at the White House, which included Trump, dozens of American business people and Chinese officials, was a rare moment of friendship lately between the world’s two largest economies. Acrimonious talks stretching back almost three years have roiled financial markets, cast a cloud of uncertainty over investment decisions and hurt growth in both nations.“This is a very important and remarkable occasion,” Trump said at the signing. “Together we are righting the wrongs of the past.”The benchmark S&P 500 Index set an intraday record high for the sixth consecutive trading session.The deal, sealed on the same day the House prepared to refer articles of Trump’s impeachment to the Senate, has already been criticized for what is missing. It does nothing to address areas like what U.S. authorities have long claimed is China’s state-backed hacking of American companies and government institutions. Nor does it require the Asian nation to reform the vast web of state subsidies that form the spine of its model of state capitalism and have helped fuel the rapid growth of Chinese companies compete internationally.The administration says many of those issues will be covered in a second phase of a deal, though when those talks will begin and how long they will take remains uncertain. In the meantime, the U.S. is also set to maintain tariffs on roughly two-thirds of imports from China.“As soon as this kicks in we’re starting phase two,” Trump said. “I will agree to take those tariffs off if we’re able to do phase two, otherwise we don’t have any cards to negotiate with. They will all come off as soon as we finish phase two.”At the ceremony, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He read a letter from President Xi Jinping, stating the two sides have to implement the agreement “in real earnest.”“I hope the U.S. side will treat fairly Chinese companies,” he said through an interpreter. In his own comments, Liu said China will “strictly honor” the pact.Trump’s top negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, told reporters ahead of the signing that the administration was focused on implementing the initial agreement in the short term. Any further negotiations will only come after that, he said.Officials also insist that they are harvesting significant commitments from Beijing that mean the phase one agreement will benefit U.S. businesses and workers even if discussions never go any further.The deal requires China to do more to stop the sale of pirated goods and to apply criminal penalties on anyone caught stealing commercial secrets. It also requires Beijing to deliver an action plan withing 30 days of the deal taking effect on how it intends to meet its commitments.It also requires China to stop pressuring American companies investing in the country to share technology with local joint-venture partners. The agreement stipulates that the Chinese must stop supporting or directing the acquisition of overseas investment aimed at buying up technologies.“This is an enormous win,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters ahead of the signing, pointing to Chinese commitments on IP that will affect the technology sector as well as other reforms on currency, the opening up of the financial services sector to U.S. companies and the promised spending spree.Other supporters of Trump’s trade policies insist that the initial deal goes a long way toward addressing the IP issues that were at the core of the case brought against China. “Anyone complaining that this doesn’t resolve every U.S.-China issue needs to recall that this entire negotiation was based on a report on China’s IP and techtransfer policies,” said Clete Willems, who until last year was a member of Trump’s national economic council and is now at law firm Akin Gump.China has already moved to address some U.S. complaints on IP. Over the past year, it has made a rapid-fire series of legal changes amid the negotiations to beef up protection. A new foreign investment law that took effect on Jan. 1 bans administrative agencies from forcing companies to transfer technological knowhow as a cost of entry to the Chinese market. It also exposes officials who disclose or leak trade secrets gleaned from regulatory approvals to potential criminal penalties.The U.S. is also moving to address remaining issues like industrial subsidies in other ways. On Tuesday the U.S., European Union, and Japan said they had agreed on the content of new stricter global rules on subsidies aimed largely at China and would be mounting a joint push to build support for them internationally.The Trump administration says what separates its deal most from others is the enforcement mechanism it establishes. Rather than rely on a slow-moving World Trade Organization dispute system that Trump in any case has already hobbled by blocking the appointment of top judges, the new agreement with China would allow the administration to move to punish Beijing with tariffs or other measures within 90 days if officials decided it was breaking its promises.But even Lighthizer acknowledges how effective that mechanism will be depends on Beijing. “This deal will work if China wants it to work,” he said Wednesday.The deal is also unique in the breadth of specific Chinese purchase commitments it contains, which some critics in the U.S. see as uncomfortably reminiscent of the sort of state-directed central planning American diplomats have spent decades trying to get China to abandon. Even those purchase promises, the details of which are contained in a secret annex to the agreement signed on Tuesday, face questions.The text of the deal released Wednesday specifies $77.7 billion in Chinese purchases of manufactured goods including aircraft, $32 billion in agricultural products, $52.4 billion in energy and $37.9 billion in services in the two years through December 2021.Much of the attention has focused on whether U.S. farm exports to China can reach the $40 billion to $50 billion annual level that Trump has promised, which would mean doubling the $24 billion in agriculture and related products it imported from the U.S. in 2017, before the trade war began.There are also questions over a Chinese commitment to buy an additional $50 billion in U.S. oil and gas over two years and pledges to step up purchases of cars, planes and other manufactured goods.To meet the energy target, China would have to import roughly one-third of the 3 million barrels a day of crude that the U.S. exported last year over a two year period, according to Bloomberg calculations. Which is why analysts believe meeting that deal may depend heavily on buying natural gas, which is usually traded via long-term contracts rather than spot purchases.However, China may not have much appetite for any additional gas right now beyond the long-term contracts it has already committed to as it continues to struggle with a slowing economy and a slowdown in demand growth and already-brimming stockpiles. Likewise, U.S. LNG export plants have most of their volumes tied up in their own long-term contracts and would only be able to provide China with a marginal amount of spot supply over the next two years.&#92;--With assistance from Miao Han, Jenny Leonard, Stephen Stapczynski, Ye Xie, Justin Sink, Jordan Fabian and Zoe Schneeweiss.To contact the reporters on this story: Shawn Donnan in Washington at sdonnan@bloomberg.net;Josh Wingrove in Washington at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net;Saleha Mohsin in Washington at smohsin2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Murray at brmurray@bloomberg.net, ;Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Ana MonteiroFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. and China Sign Phase One of Trade Deal

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg) -- After last year’s deluge of financial technology megadeals, investors wondered if the boom could continue into 2020. This week, Visa Inc.’s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid Inc. offered an answer: Yes.  “Visa buying Plaid brings fintech from out in the wild to something more mainstream,” said Bain Capital Ventures’ Matt Harris. “It’s a ‘growing up’ moment for all of us,” he said, adding that the startup will now be part of the “critical infrastructure underlying the financial services industry.”Plaid’s rapid ascent—Square Inc. looked at buying it in 2018 for just a fifth of the eventual selling price—comes as large companies look to expand their offerings, and contend with fast-growing digital competition. In November, PayPal Holdings Inc. snapped up online coupon company Honey Science Corp. for $4 billion. Charles Schwab Corp. acquired TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion. And Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and Global Payments Inc. did a series of major deals in 2019 that remade the corporate landscape of payment processing.Today there are nearly 60 financial technology startups valued at more than $1 billion, according to data from CB Insights, a research firm. Many are now acquisition targets, analysts say. Those include smaller players like SoftBank Group Corp.-backed unicorn Kabbage Inc., as well as giants like Stripe Inc., most recently valued at $35 billion, a price tag that makes it one of the world’s largest startups. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Harshita Rawat, said in a note that Fiserv and PayPal could be potential bidders for Stripe.Ryan Caldwell, chief executive officer of financial data company MX Technologies Inc., suggested the Visa deal could trigger a domino effect in the industry. “The space tends to heat up when there's been one acquisition,” Caldwell said, adding that larger companies were increasingly aware of fintech’s potential. “A lot of these players definitely need to partner,” he said.Satya Patel, a partner at venture capital firm Homebrew, which was a Plaid investor, said he didn’t expect a bonanza for VCs. “As an active fintech investor, I’d like to think that its acquisition is a sign of things to come,” but added that for every Plaid there will be many more startups that are bought for much less, or go out of business. While companies like Plaid and Stripe deal with the plumbing of fintech, would-be acquirers may also seek out consumer-facing financial startups. In the consumer world, “a re-bundling of financial products is underway,” Patel said. Analysts have speculated that future potential acquisitions could involve some of the new payment plan and lending services, such as Affirm Inc., Afterpay and Klarna Bank AB.“The alternative lending space feels ripe for consolidation,” said Lisa Ellis, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. These firms would make sense for “possibly PayPal or Square, since they have alternative lending businesses already and these would extend those, even banks like a Discover,’’ she said.The rising crop of digital-first alternative banks, or “neo-banks,” saw big investment last year, and may also see an uptick in deals. Digital banking startups like Chime Inc., Revolut Ltd., N26 and Dave Inc. fall into this category. Because many of them have similar business models, experts believe the industry could be ripe for buyouts.“The neo-bank space will probably consolidate at some point,’’ Ellis said. “Many firms are burning cash just trying to buy and acquire customers.” But that might not happen right away. Said Ellis: “The valuation bubble has to pop a bit for that group to be acquired.”(Adds investor quote in sixth paragraph. )&#92;--With assistance from Jennifer Surane.To contact the author of this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne VanderMey at avandermey@bloomberg.net, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Visa's Plaid Takeover Signals Wave of Fintech Dealmaking

For example, housing starts jumped to a 13-year high last month. Housing starts of 1.6 million in the last month of 2019 topped the 1.375 million units economists were expecting and likely contributed to Home Depot (NYSE:HD) as one of the best Dow performers after Visa.Housing data is vital because that segment accounts for over 3% of domestic economic output.

Stocks seem to be reflecting as much. A DowngradeWhile Home Depot, Visa and plenty of others were among the Dow winners today, IBM (NYSE:IBM) wasn't part of the fund. Big Blue only gained 0.23% after Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty downgraded the stock to &quot;equal-weight&quot; from &quot;overweight.&quot; She maintains a $155 price target on the stock.&quot;With signs of deceleration at core IBM, we see long-term revenue growth as less likely without a more meaningful shift in the portfolio,&quot; Huberty said in a note to clients.She added that a Morgan Stanley survey of CIOs indicates spending on IBM products and services could slow and there is &quot;risk to CY20 EPS guidance.&quot;Overall, IBM's Friday decline was modest and it was far from the worst-performing stock in the Dow today. Boeing AgainThat &quot;honor&quot; goes to Boeing (NYSE:BA), a stock that has been making regular appearances in this space to start 2020, often for challenging reasons. Today, Boeing issued a statement saying it's making &quot;necessary changes&quot; to the software in the 737 MAX passenger jet. At issue is monitor connectivity, which tells pilots if systems are operating correctly.&quot;One of the monitors was not being initiated correctly, officials said. The monitor check is prompted by a software command at airplane or system power up, and will set the appropriate indication if maintenance is required, company officials added,&quot; according to Reuters.The software update is needed, but is another delay in the effort to get the 737 MAX back in the skies. Fun FactIn cheerier news, there's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which posted another modest gain. I can remember writing about Apple seven or eight years and using factoids, such as the stock's market value exceeding that of all the stocks in countries like Poland and Vietnam. Well, hat tip to CNBC on this one, Apple is now worth more than the entire Australian equity market and that's saying something because that's a top 15 global economy. More MicrosoftMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) basically flat on the day, but it wasn't for lack of news flow.

2020-01-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Telecom giant Vodafone Group Plc left the Libra Association, becoming the latest company to exit the Facebook-led group trying to create a new global cryptocurrency.The Libra Association, which was finalized last October, once expected to have as many as 28 total members when the project was announced in June. It is now down to 20 following earlier departures from Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and others that had committed to the project but then left before the group signed an official charter.“Vodafone is no longer a member of the Libra Association,” Dante Disparte, head of policy and communication for the association, said in a statement. “Although the makeup of the Association members may change over time, the design of Libra’s governance and technology ensures the Libra payment system will remain resilient. The Association is continuing the work to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of the Libra payment system.”The idea for Libra -- a global, digital currency intended to make cross-border money transfers as easy as sending a text message -- has faced opposition at every turn. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, first proposed the idea last June, along with a number of high-profile partners. Many of them are no longer involved, and Facebook has pledged to appease all U.S. regulators before launching the currency. It’s unclear how long that might take.Coindesk earlier reported news of Vodafone’s departure from the group.In a statement, U.K.-based Vodafone said it plans to focus on its own digital payments efforts instead. Vodafone partly owns Safaricom Plc, which operates the M-Pesa mobile-payments app in Kenya, where more people keep their money on their phones rather than in banks. The text message-based app is used by about 35 million people globally to spend, borrow and send money to friends and family.“We will continue to monitor the development of the Libra Association and do not rule out the possibility of future co-operation,” Vodafone spokesman Steve Shepperson-Smith said.&#92;--With assistance from Jenny Surane and Scott Moritz.To contact the reporter on this story: Kurt Wagner in San Francisco at kwagner71@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Vodafone Abandons Facebook-Led Libra Cryptocurrency Project
2020-01-21,"(Bloomberg) -- As Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co. prepare to enter China for the first time, one of their biggest competitive threats will come from a company that doesn’t issue credit cards.Jack Ma’s Ant Financial, already the biggest player in China’s $27 trillion payments market, is leveraging its ubiquitous Alipay mobile app to mount a rapid expansion into consumer lending.Instead of issuing cards, Ant allows customers to borrow with a few taps on their smartphones. The loans are wildly popular among China’s army of mobile-savvy shoppers, who often lack formal credit histories but generate enough financial data via Alipay for Ant to make informed decisions on whether they’ll default. The company’s outstanding consumer loans may swell to nearly 2 trillion yuan ($290 billion) by 2021, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts, more than triple the level two years ago.“The consumer loans business has been growing at breakneck speed, but there are so many untapped users,” Huang Hao, president of Ant’s digital finance operations, said in a phone interview outlining the company’s strategy.Ant’s push into China’s 10 trillion yuan market for short-term consumer loans will make it an even more formidable challenger to U.S. card companies, which are counting on the world’s second-largest economy as a source of long-term growth.Many Chinese consumers and businesses are ditching credit cards as Ant and its main competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd. make app-based spending, borrowing and investing increasingly user-friendly. In a Nielsen survey of more than 3,000 Chinese people born after 1990, nearly 61% said they use online consumer credit while only 45.5% had a credit card.“For credit card companies coming to China, the biggest challenge is how to attract people,” said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Singapore-based consulting firm Kapronasia. “A lot of Chinese millennials are digital first, used to using Alipay as their first platform for payments, loans and wealth management.”The card giants appear to be moving forward with their China plans despite the headwinds. AmEx’s application to start a bank card clearing business has been accepted by the country’s central bank, while Mastercard has called China a “vital” market and Visa has said it’s working closely with regulators for a license.As part of its phase-one trade agreement with the U.S., China said it won’t take longer than 90 days to consider applications from providers of electronic-payments services. Regulators are opening the industry to foreign competition amid an unprecedented push to give international firms access to the country’s financial sector.Read more: Visa, Mastercard, AmEx Win Easier Access to China MarketIn response to questions from Bloomberg on the threat posed by Ant, Visa said it sees significant potential to support the growth and evolution of digital payments in China and is approaching the market with a long-term focus. Mastercard said it would continue to work with regulators to advance its application and is committed for the long haul. AmEx declined to comment.Ant, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that’s widely expected to pursue an initial public offering in coming years, started its consumer-credit business in 2015. Its loans tend to be small: half the users of Ant’s Huabei (translation: “just spend”) service borrow less than $290 and usually pay it back within months.The Hangzhou-based company, which declined to disclose the value of its outstanding loans, keeps delinquencies in check by tapping into a trove of data amassed by Alipay and Alibaba.Many customers have been using the payments and e-commerce platforms for years -- handing over details from ID cards to addresses and spending habits. Once Ant extends a loan, it can track how the money is spent via Alipay. The result is a bad-debt ratio stands at about 1%, below the 1.24% national average for credit cards.Read more: China’s Gen Z, With Little Income, Gets Hooked on Easy CreditAnt keeps some of the loans on its own balance sheet, charging interest rates that range from about 5% to 18%, according to Huang. But most are passed on for a fee to banks and other financial institutions.“We’re set to continue to work with more banks and finance companies,” Huang said. “We are, at the end of the day, a platform.”The risk for Visa, Mastercard and AmEx is that a swathe of Chinese consumers and businesses will view credit cards as obsolete. About 60% of borrowers on Ant’s Huabei platform don’t have one, and many smaller merchants don’t accept cards because they find it’s cheaper and easier to use Alipay or Tencent’s WePay. The former, with more than 900 million users, is Alibaba’s preferred payments provider.“The competitive landscape is full of local players,” said Hang Qian, a partner at Oliver Wyman, a consultancy. “The key challenges are how to promote small merchants to accept credit cards and how to get e-wallet users to switch.”&#92;--With assistance from Alfred Liu.To contact the reporter on this story: Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong at ychen447@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Patterson at mpatterson10@bloomberg.net, Jodi SchneiderFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Jack Ma’s Booming Loan Business Threatens Visa, AmEx in China"

2020-01-24,"While the market reaches new highs, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock remains in neutral. Square does trade at a high valuation. But with analysts predicting growth deceleration since August, investors have been less confident in giving this stock an even higher valuation.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Is Mr. Market right in discounting Square's future prospects? Is Square a software-as-a-service pioneer like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)? Or is the company more like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) or legacy payment processors like Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA)? Back in October, a Barron's article made the case for the latter. In other words, implying more downside for SQ stock.Add in increased competition, and Square does not look like a great opportunity. So, what's the verdict? Let's dive in, and see why SQ stock is most likely going to be stuck in neutral in 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Does Fintech Consolidation Mean for SQ Stock?I've before discussed how the competition's heating up for Square. Square's merchant platform faces growing competition from established players like Fiserv. In retail peer-to-peer payments, Square's Cash App goes toe-to-toe with PayPal's Venmo. Square can still expand its merchant and consumer businesses. But customer acquisition costs could skyrocket as the market becomes crowded.  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy Square has its work cut out for it. Yet, the company could be an ideal bolt-on acquisition for a larger financial services company. Potential acquirers like Visa or Mastercard come to mind. InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn expressed similar sentiments in his Dec. 30 SQ stock analysis. Blankenhorn argued that strategic buyers could pay a 33% premium to its then-trading price of $63.50 per share. In other words, $84.45 per share.Yet, this article came out before Visa's announced acquisition of Plaid. Plaid provides the back-end technology that allows fintech apps like Coinbase and Robinhood to link with your bank account. Why is this recent deal relevant to SQ stock? It could mean Square isn't the type of company deep-pocked payment companies are looking to buy.By owning the key gatekeeper between banks and fintech startups, Visa may not need to buy a company like Square to stay relevant. If businesses and customers pivot toward fintech startups in lieu of legacy payment processors, Visa can still win by owning Plaid. Visa could also leverage its ownership of Plaid to compete with Plaid's existing clients.Square was in talks to buy Plaid in 2018. Unfortunately, they couldn't get their hands on this hot asset. Doing so would've given them in edge against both startup rivals, as well as legacy payment providers. Square Needs Time to Grow Into Its ValuationSQ stock currently trades for 88.7 times estimated 2019 earnings, and 71.5 times estimated 2020 earnings. In contrast, payment rivals PayPal trades for 38 times 2019 earnings, and 33.3 times 2020 earnings. Their other main rival, Fiserv, trades for 30 times 2019 earnings, and 23.6 times projected 2020 earnings. Square's faster growth rate does justify a valuation premium. But with risks growth could decelerate, paying 71.5 forward earnings doesn't look like a smart move.Could Square grow into its valuation? It could. But even Square's high projected earnings growth of 23% implies it would take a while. In the meantime, investors may start giving Square a lower earnings multiple, sending shares to lower levels.So what's the solution? As InvestorPlace's Josh Enomoto recently wrote, the company's Square Capital lending business could move the needle long term. But investors are well aware of Square's intent to become a fintech &quot;financial supermarket.&quot; Square could win big with this aggressive growth strategy.But looking at the competitive environment, it seems Square is sandwiched in the middle. On one hand, you have new startups that could outfox Square via innovation. On the other hand, deep-pocketed rivals to use scale to hamper Square's growth plans.That's not to say that Square will be muscled out of business. Yet, growth above expectations seems less likely. With this in mind, it seems SQ stock is more likely to come down valuation-wise than go higher thanks to expectation-exceeding growth. Bottom Line: SQ Stock Could Stay in NeutralSquare has much potential to further disrupt financial services. However, I do not believe the company's valuation premium to payment peers like PayPal is sustainable. If February's earnings call indicates further growth deceleration, SQ stock could fall to a valuation closer to that of peers.Square's move to become a fintech &quot;financial supermarket&quot; further cements the argument that the company is not comparable to a SaaS name like Shopify. Square deserves a growth premium to PayPal, Visa and others, but not a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 71.5.So what's the call? Stay away from SQ stock. The company could surprise come February. But chances are Square shares tread water at best in the coming year.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Investors continue to pour funds into passive investment products that aim to replicate the performance of benchmark indexes. They’re also increasingly keen that their money gets used to influence corporations to stop damaging the planet and improve social inclusiveness. Unfortunately, many of the products designed to achieve both objectives currently fall short on the goal of responsible investing.The shift in emphasizing environmental, social and governance issues puts pressure on the index providers to come up with benchmarks that more accurately reflect the concerns investors are attempting to express by allocating capital to ESG investment products. Currently, though, even dedicated ESG indexes have shortcomings that many investors are probably unaware of.The U.S. Vegan Climate exchange-traded fund, for example, tracks a $124 billion index created by Beyond Investing that excludes companies engaged in a laundry list of potentially harmful activities, including animal exploitation, human rights abuses and fossil fuels extraction. While the $14 million ETF’s top five holdings — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc., Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. — may all meet those criteria, they’re hardly the first names that spring to mind when thinking about the words vegan or climate. And there are many other examples.BlackRock Inc.’s announcement this month that it plans to prioritize sustainability in its investment decisions highlights the issue confronting index trackers. With two-thirds of its $7.4 trillion of assets managed passively, the world’s biggest asset manager acknowledged that the bulk of its cash isn’t available to pursue those goals. Harnessing that firepower will become increasingly important if the passive industry is to meet the ESG aspirations of its growing customer base.It’s even likely to radically change the industry, and sooner than people realize. To that point, Hiro Mizuno, the chief investment officer of Japan’s $1.6 trillion Global Pension Investment Fund, says the days are over when it’s enough for passive fund managers to compete simply on providing the lowest tracking errors at the lowest cost. Now they have to add value too. “The main battlefield among our passive managers is going to be in the stewardship area.” he told the Financial Times last month. BlackRock is far from alone in shifting to a more moral investing stance. A survey of 300 institutional investors, financial advisers and fund managers that use ETFs published on Monday by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. showed that almost three-quarters of respondents expect to increase the amount allocated to ESG investments in the coming year.European participants in the BBH survey ranked ESG-themed products as the ETF category they would most like to see more supply of, while Chinese investors ranked the sector as their second most desired area of expansion, along with more funds designed to track core indexes.Money is flooding into the sector. ESG-designated assets were the fastest-growing category of ETFs listed on Deutsche Boerse AG’s Xetra market last year, with investments more than tripling to more than 23 billion euros ($25 billion). Globally, ESG ETFs have enjoyed net inflows for 52 consecutive weeks, taking in $30 billion in the past year and garnering almost $3.4 billion in the week ended Jan. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg LP, which competes in selling index data to investors.There are two main routes whereby ETF providers can meet the implicit demands of clients allocating money to passively managed ESG products. The first is to use their collective muscle to prompt index providers to increase the granularity of the benchmarks used to shape asset allocations. Improving the discrimination of ESG indexes would go a long way to ensuring investors aren’t being hoodwinked into products that aren’t as green or socially savvy as they first appear.The second is trickier. Excluding companies deemed to be damaging the environment or being socially irresponsibly isn’t enough to move the needle. Engaging with the boards of those firms and using the clout of a shareholding to force them to change their ways is much more effective.But that costs money, and the success of the ETF model has been founded in large part on its ability to charge ultra-low fees. If BlackRock and its peers are serious about taking their social responsibilities more seriously, investors will have to pay for the privilege — and the sellers of index trackers will need to be honest about the increased cost of that kind of activism. Let’s hope the buyers of the products decide it’s a price worth paying to do good.To contact the author of this story: Mark Gilbert at magilbert@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Mark Gilbert is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering asset management.

2020-01-31,"With the Federal Reserve set to pause once again on interest rates, investors have been given freedom to buy high-yielding assets. Bonds to REITs have seen their stars shine over the last few months. However, investors may want to focus beyond just a large headline yield.Truth be told, the best dividend stocks are those that have grown their payouts over time. And the proof is the pudding.According to Ned Davis Research study, in the years 1972 and 2013, dividend growth stocks managed to post an average annual return of 10.07%. That bested the 9.28% return for the entire dividend paying universe and was higher the overall stock market average return as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSimilarly, Hartford Fund's research shows that dividends constituted 33% of S&P 500 monthly total return between 1926 and 2015.Clearly dividend growth investing has been a powerful tool to build wealth. And investors should exploit this fact in the current environment. Having a high yield is good, but getting more income year in and year out is just that much better. And thanks to rising profits, lower corporate taxes and bulging balance sheets, there's just that much more cash to go around.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for February Contrarians Which firms make ideal dividend stocks with growing payouts to bet on? Here are three that make the cut. Visa (V)Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 0.6%Visa (NYSE:V) is a prime example of how a headline yield can be deceiving. At first glance, Visa's 0.6% current dividend yield isn't exactly something to write home about. That is, until you hear about Visa's torrid pace of dividend growth.Since its IPO in 2008, Visa has managed to grow its dividend by a whopping 1040.68%. No, that's not a typo. That includes last years big 20% jump in its payout.The reason for that kind of massive dividend growth is simple. Visa is simply a toll-road that throws off plenty of high margined cash flows.While we may have a Visa card in our wallets or purses, Visa isn't an issuer of credit itself. It operates a secured payment network that consumers, businesses, banks and merchants all use to move money around. Every time they do, Visa gets a fee. It's a high margined business that throws tons of free cash flows.Thanks to its huge moat, Visa is really one of the few games in town offering this service. As a result, it has been able to send plenty of cash back to investors. Adjusted free cash flows clocked in at more than $3.8 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter alone.But Visa has other avenues for growth as well. New mobile payment operations and online digital wallets will help strengthen its position in the cashless society of the future. Meanwhile, its recent purchase of Plaid gives it a vital foothold in fintech and the world of digital financial services.What it all means for investors is that Visa has plenty of growth left in the tank to make it a great buy among dividend stocks in spite of its small yield.

The key to that has been Wendy's new updated menu, mobile apps, social media team and delivery partnership with Door Dash and Grubhub (NASDAQ:GRUB).Those moves have once made Wendy's a leader in the Burger Wars. Profitability is way up thanks to this new &quot;1 More Visit, 1 More Dollar&quot; strategic plan. The firm has plenty of avenues to keep the growth going such as its new breakfast menu, digital kiosks, and high margined bundled combo meals.All of this has quietly made Wendy's into one of the best dividend stocks out there. Over the last ten years, Wendy's has been raising its payout. But thanks to its high margins and continued sales boost, the burger joint has kicked into high gear. Last year alone, WEN managed to raise its payout twice for a 41% total jump in its dividend.  * 7 Under-the-Radar European Stocks to Buy for 2020 With Wendy's targeting sales growth of 4% to 5% per year and 50% payout ratio, investors will be able to see similar long-term growth in their dividend income from the stock. So while WEN's current 2.21% is about average for the broader market, the power behind that payout is great. Medtronic (MDT)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.86%Both Wendy's and Visa's dividend growth stories are relatively new. But there are plenty of dividend stocks that have been delivering the goods for decades. A prime example is medical device maker Medtronic (NYSE:MDT).Since creating the first pacemaker back in the 1950s, MDT has continued to innovate across a wide variety of medical devices, therapies, and health needs. These days, the focus is on high margined and specialized devices. Glucose/Insulin pumps that use A.I., artificial hearts, spinal surgery gear, etc. Aside from providing bigger profits to Medtronic's bottom line, these sorts of devices are outside the icy grasp of too much government regulation when it comes to price. It's a smart move for both now and later.In the now, it has made Medtronic a star dividend payer. The firm has been raising dividends for 42 years straight. This puts in elite company. Even better, over the last five years, those payouts have risen by around 12% annually. That's some pretty impressive dividend growth.With more focus on &quot;tech-like&quot; medical devices coming down the pike, management expects the growth to continue with 8% annual EPS growth targets for the next few years. That will certainly allow MDT to keep its pace of strong dividend growth going.Once again, Medtronic is highlighting the fact that an initial high yield isn't everything, especially over the long haul.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2020-01-31,"PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) released its earnings on Wednesday afternoon -- and investors don't seem impressed by the results, as PayPal stock is little changed since then.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The response is somewhat logical. PayPal's Q4 numbers did beat analysts' average estimates, but not by much; investors likely were looking for more fireworks. The company's outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2020, at least based on the headline numbers, appear somewhat soft. One-time factors played a role, but the Q4 results don't seem like a massive beat that has materially changed the company's outlook.But that's fine because its outlook didn't need to change. PayPal remains one of the better growth stories in the market, and PayPal stock has one of the more attractive valuations among growth names. Its Q4 earnings and 2020 guidance were more than enough to keep the company's outlook intact. In the wake of the results,   PYPL stock is still intriguing for medium-term and long-term investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Headline ResultsThe lukewarm reaction to PayPal's earnings does make some sense because its Q4 results and 2020 guidance were essentially in-line with expectations. Its revenue increased 18% year-over-year in Q4, excluding currency fluctuations, as its  transaction payment volume jumped 22%, excluding currency fluctuations.Its bottom-line performance was even better: as its management noted, the 2.04 percentage point  YoY increase in its operating margin was its biggest such  expansion since PayPal split from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015.  * How to Insure Your Wealth Before the Coronavirus Strikes Again But the growth was mostly expected: its revenue increase was within 0.4 percentage points of the average analyst estimate. A 3 cent beat relative to average earnings per share expectations is nothing new for PayPal, and it's not terribly surprising in an era in which tech companies almost always beat mean bottom-line estimates.Post-earnings headlines indicate that the company's  guidance gave investors some pause. At first glance, PayPal's outlook does appear to be disappointing. Its Q1 revenue and earnings guidance came in below analysts' average estimate. Full-year EPS guidance, excluding some items, of $3.39-$3.46 fell shy of the $3.49 mean estimate ahead of the release.The company's outlook is better than those headline numbers suggest, however. And its guidance more than enough to keep the company's attractive long-term outlook intact. Understanding PayPal's 2020 GuidanceIt appears that the difference between analysts' expectations and PayPal's numbers come down to acquisitions.  PayPal noted that  acquisitions will reduce its  2020 EPS by 8 cents to 10 cents.PayPal also changed its criteria for adjusted earnings; in 2020, the company will exclude the impact of gains and losses on its investments from its adjusted earnings. In 2019, gains from its investments boosted its EPS by 14 cents. But investments will have no impact on its reported adjusted earnings this year.So PayPal's bottom-line growth is much stronger than its headline numbers suggest. Its 2020 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.39-$3.46, against the $3.10 it reported in 2019, suggests a roughly 9%-11% YoY increase. But excluding the effect of acquisitions and 2019 investment gains, PYPL actually expects its EPS to jump 18%-20% this year.The extent to which Street estimates incorporate the company's acquisitions or potential gains or losses on its investments is unclear. At minimum, PayPal's guidance isn't 100% comparable to analysts' estimates. The impact of acquisitions alone accounts for the difference between PayPal's guidance and analysts' average estimates. That, in turn, suggests that PayPal's earnings growth remains nicely on track. The Case for PayPal StockGiven the fact that PayPal's guidance actually looks attractive, PayPal stock looks appealing. The shares trade at about 34 times the midpoint of the company's 2020's EPS guidance. That's a reasonably high multiple,  but not when the company's profits are growing at an 18%-plus clip, particularly in this market.Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is trading at a higher multiple to its expected 2020 EPS and its growth rate is lower. Visa's (NYSE:V) price-earnings ratio is nearly  30&#92;. Square (NYSE:SQ) does have more growth potential, but its valuation is much higher than that of PayPal stock.On a relative basis, then, being long PYPL stock makes sense at these levels, particularly with the shares trading sideways since June.The shares' valuation alone makes them attractive. A P/E ratio of 33 isn't cheap, but PayPal reiterated that it expects to generate 20% annual EPS growth for some time to come. That growth is more than enough to allow the company to grow into its current valuation -- and beyond.Moreover, the company has additional  opportunities in China and other foreign countries, and  its Venmo business can continue to grow. Its loss of revenue from eBay is a concern, but since eBay accounted for only 14% of its total sales, the impact is more than manageable. PayPal should be able to grow despite that development.PayPal's strong outlook is what makes PYPL attractive -- and its outlook wasn't changed by the Q4 report.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-02-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Worldline SA agreed to buy rival Ingenico Group SA in a 7.8 billion-euro ($8.6 billion) deal the French technology companies say will form one of the largest payment-services providers.The two companies had been circling each other for years, and Worldline Chief Executive Officer Gilles Grapinet said on a conference call Monday that Ingenico’s reorganization last year made it the right time to bid.The takeover – the biggest of the year so far in Europe – continues last year’s spate of payments company mergers, which included a series of major deals from Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information Services Inc. and Global Payments Inc.Ingenico shareholders will receive 123.10 euros a share in cash or a mixture of cash and shares, the companies said Monday. That’s 17% higher than the stock’s last closing price. Worldline is also offering to buy bonds that are convertible into Ingenico shares. Worldline shareholders will own about 65% of the combined company.Ingenico gained as much as 14% in Paris on Monday, rising to 119.9 euros, the biggest intraday move in more than a year. Worldline fell as much as 8.6%.The deal looks “very positive” for Worldline at first glance, giving the company an opportunity to add to its European leadership team and increase its market share, analysts at Bryan Garnier & Co. said in a note Monday. The combined company will also have a more diversified profile than its U.S. peers, they said.Read more about Ingenico’s management shakeup here.The deal comes after a number of challenging years for Ingenico, which provides payments processing services to customers including banks, retailers and e-commerce sites, and is one of the few large firms to remain independent in the rapidly consolidating payments industry in Europe.Ingenico for years has been pushing to refocus from its legacy business -- capturing transactions on behalf of banks or credit card companies using hardware terminals in stores -- toward new services in areas like online shopping.In November 2018, Ingenico CEO Philippe Lazare was removed following a request from the board. Lazare, who led the company for 11 years, had been under increasing pressure over its performance and management struggled to convince investors of the merits of its legacy terminals business.Ingenico has since recovered, its shares more than doubling in the past year after Chief Operating Officer Nicolas Huss took over as CEO in a move many thought could lead to a potential deal. The same month, Natixis SA declined to bid for Ingenico after holding preliminary talks.“Timing is everything,” Grapinet said when asked on a call with analysts why the company didn’t attempt to buy Ingenico last year. “If you look at the stock price, it could’ve been a bargain, but I’m not sure the board of Ingenico would’ve been ready to sell.”Worldline was spun out of French computer-services provider Atos via an initial public offering in 2014, and with a 11 billion-euro market value is now bigger than its previous owner. In 2018 Worldline snapped up SIX Group AG’s payments business for 2.3 billion euros, in one of the first deals that sparked the ongoing wave of consolidation in the industry.“The combination of Worldline and Ingenico offers a unique opportunity to create the undisputed European champion in payments,” Ingenico Chairman Bernard Bourigeaud said in a statement Monday. “This transaction comes at the time of accelerating consolidation of the industry.”French state investor and Ingenico shareholder Bpifrance Financement SA said it “fully supports” the deal and in a statement said it was “committed to contribute its Ingenico shares to Worldline’s public offer and intends to become a long-term reference shareholder of the combined entity.” Bpifrance owns about 5.3% of Ingenico shares according to data compiled by Bloomberg.SIX Group and Atos, Worldline’s largest shareholders, are also in favor of the deal.Payments dealmaking may be set to continue. Worldline will become the “platform of choice for further consolidation in Europe” Grapinet said on the call.Investors have been keen to cash in on alternatives to traditional banking services. Vista Equity Partners is considering selling a stake in Finastra in a deal that could value the company at more than $10 billion including debt, Bloomberg News reported in October.Earlier in January Visa Inc. agreed to pay $5.3 billion for Plaid, a fintech firm that connects popular apps like Venmo to customers’ data in the established banking system.The combined market value of Ingenico and Worldline will be about 19 billion euros as of trading Monday, leapfrogging rival Wirecard AG.(Updates with context throughout, share price, comments from analyst call)&#92;--With assistance from Tara Patel and Thomas Mulier.To contact the reporter on this story: Amy Thomson in London at athomson6@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Giles Turner at gturner35@bloomberg.net, Nate LanxonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Payment-Services Giant Worldline to Buy Ingenico in $8.6 Billion Deal

2020-02-03,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Consolidation in the digital payments industry has traditionally meant bold deals to buy fast-growing assets at sky-high valuations — with the acquirers often cheered on blindly by investors. Worldline SA has chosen a different path: A modestly expensive deal to buy struggling French peer Ingenico Group SA. Shareholders have frowned. Worldline Chief Executive Officer Gilles Grapinet must be wishing he’d stuck with convention.Ingenico has been a bid target for some time. It is weighed down by a handheld terminals business and has been playing catch-up in online payments. Late 2018 brought a management and strategy reset with the appointment of former Visa executive Nicolas Huss as CEO. Natixis SA, a French bank, dropped plans for a possible takeover not long afterwards, sending Ingenico shares to just 45 euros apiece. Just over a year later, Worldline is offering a combination of cash and its own stock that’s worth 123.10 euros a share based on its last closing price. That values Ingenico’s equity at 7.8 billion euros ($8.6 billion).Maybe Worldline should have moved sooner, but it would have struggled to coax its target to the table before now. An attempt at a deal last year would have been blatantly opportunistic, with Ingenico’s shares on the floor, and Huss’s elevation has bolstered the company’s bid defenses. Grapinet would have needed to offer a much bigger premium than the 17% that has secured this deal. What’s more, the transaction value of 15 times expected 2020 Ebitda is relatively sober in this part of the fintech sector. Fidelity National Information Services Inc. paid 29 times trailing Ebitda for Worldpay Inc. in July. Denmark’s Nets A/S succumbed to a leveraged buyout at 18 times Ebitda in 2018.The lower valuation reflects the fact that Worldline is not acquiring a business firing on all cylinders. The deal starts to look more pricey when you consider what the buyer is getting. Based on Ingenico’s expected financial performance for 2020, the starting return on the total 9.5 billion euros all-in cost (including assumed net debt) would be just 4%. Worldline reckons it can extract 250 million euros of financial benefits come 2024, when analysts forecast Ingenico could generate about 720 million euros in operating profit. Adjusting for tax, the returns might then get to a more reasonable 8%. Still, investors have to wait for it.What's more, Worldline’s board would expand to an unwieldy 17 members, including a director from the French state investment bank.Might things turn out better than Worldline’s shareholders believe? Grapinet has some options to do more than simply finish the recovery that Huss has started. One possibility would be carving out Ingenico’s terminals business and auctioning it to private equity firms. That would leave him with faster growing operations and help bring down net debt, which is likely to touch 2.5 times Ebitda after paying 2 billion euros for the cash part of the deal.It’s a reasonable piece of M&A, but no more. Investor caution is understandable. There may be higher quality targets out there. The snag is that Grapinet would have to overpay even more to get them.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2020-02-07,"While Square (NYSE:SQ) has ushered in a revolution of cashless payments, investors aren't giving it the credit it deserves. Sure, SQ stock's 2020 performance is nothing short of eye-opening, attracting a near-25% gain year-to-date. But shares still sit more than 20% below their highs from October 2018.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I expect the rally to continue once more investors recognize its opportunity. When that happens, Square will return to $100-plus for good.Square's opportunity in payments simply is too large for SQ to keep lagging other stocks in its sector. With new markets only adding to the company's potential, Square should have not just years, but decades, of growth ahead.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEven though SQ stock isn't cheap, that kind of growth simply isn't priced in. The Opportunity in PaymentsSquare's simple dongle revolutionized payments by turning any smartphone into a credit card swipe. The company, of course, has come a long way since then.Square has expanded into ever-improved point of sale systems that improve the experience for both the customer and the retailer. Its software offerings go well beyond payments to payroll, accounting and appointment scheduling.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks Under $5 to Buy Now Everything a small business might need, Square now offers. And the company doesn't just serve small businesses anymore. Sellers with over $500,000 in annual revenue now drive over one-quarter of the company's total payment volume.Again, the world is going to become cashless. I personally use cash maybe once a month, if that -- and I know I'm not alone. Square is a big part of the disruption in how American consumers pay for goods and services -- and will benefit from that disruption going forward.More and more small businesses will drive their payments through Square's point-of-sale (POS) systems. Growth in online sales, too, will add to payment volume -- and Square revenue. And the company has barely cracked the international market: overseas revenue was barely 5% of the company's total in the first nine months of 2019.To top it off, Square Cash is seeing increasing adoption. That product seems to be outperforming PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) Venmo. Square still isn't getting much revenue from Square Cash -- but with billions of dollars in transfers annually, it will. Additional Growth DriversOf course, Square has two key growth drivers beyond payments and Square Cash. The company has been forward-thinking in cryptocurrency, becoming one of the first payment companies to process bitcoin transactions. That's now a big business for Square: bitcoin revenue nearly tripled in the first three quarters of 2019, and totaled nearly $340 million.That makes SQ stock an intriguing play on Bitcoin. And as I've written on this site, I believe the price of Bitcoin will soar, potentially to as high as $100,000. The coming &quot;halvening&quot; should be a huge upside catalyst for the price. Square, more so than any publicly traded payments company, should profit.Square stock offers exposure to another significant trend: cannabidiol, more commonly referred to as CBD. The company launched its CBD offering last year, providing an all-in-one solution for sellers targeting that potentially enormous market.Admittedly, CBD sales have been somewhat disappointing of late, largely due to unclear guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But CBD will be a large and fast-growing market. Square should be at the forefront of that growth. Why SQ Stock Should Catch UpSquare simply has multiple opportunities to drive growth for years to come. Yet, again, that's done little for SQ stock. It's lagged for nearly 18 months now -- while other payment stocks have soared.Both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) trade near all-time highs. Each stock has gained more than 40% over the past twelve months. PYPL stock is tracking new highs. Small business play Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has been perhaps the market's best stock in recent years.Even with its YTD run, however, SQ stock is well below its past highs. Admittedly, the stock doesn't look cheap. But a stock with this kind of opportunity simply shouldn't be cheap. Meanwhile, upfront expenses to market to new customers and develop new offerings for existing customers are pressuring near-term earnings.Once investors better understand the opportunity Square has, and look to the long-term earnings potential, SQ stock should rally. Considering the optimism toward the sector, there's no reason why SQ, too, can't reach all-time highs. That suggests another 25% upside from here -- and a stock price in the triple digits for good.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-02-12,"(Bloomberg) -- BP Plc’s ambitious plan to go green is winning accolades from at least one high-profile investor.ValueAct Capital Management started building a position in BP after an “inspired” presentation Wednesday from the energy giant’s new boss about his plans to eliminate almost all its carbon emissions, according to ValueAct Chairman Jeff Ubben.The bet is on BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney’s vision for the oil and gas company, which goes far beyond any of its peers, Ubben said in an interview. While Ubben had been studying the company for a while, he was inspired to buy shares during Looney’s pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions from operations and production to net zero within 30 years.“I just started buying while I was watching,” Ubben said. “Someone needs to stand up and reward these guys.”The investment was made through the $1 billion ValueAct Spring Fund, which is focused on social and environmental investing, Ubben said. BP’s strategy is exactly the sort of investment the fund is looking for, he said. He didn’t disclose the size of his stake.While peers including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and Equinor ASA have responded to investor pressure by adopting targets for emissions curbs, none has promised to zero them out like BP.It highlights the perils of investing in companies with so-called environmental, social and governance agendas, Ubben said.“ESG is total crap,” Ubben said, noting that the five most owned stocks in ESG funds are Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Visa Inc., Apple Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc.. “It is worse than greenwashing, since these investors ignore the externalities of Google mining your privacy; Visa earning monopoly rents on the back of small business; and Apple’s extractive business model of selling you a new phone full of mined materials as often as possible.”He said to actually have an impact, investors have to get involved with the companies where their core business deals directly with the biggest problems of the day, which he said is climate change. To that end, he said the ValueAct Spring Fund has joined the board of power producer AES Corp. to help facilitate its move away from fossil fuels and the private board of Nikola Corp.Representatives for Apple, Visa, and Alphabet weren’t immediately available for comment.ValueAct on Wednesday also was granted a seat on the board of Hawaiian Electric Industries Inc. Eva Zlotnicka, managing director of the Spring Fund, will join the board and also sit on its compensation committee.ValueAct, which owns a 1.5% stake in the utility, had urged Hawaiian Electric to look externally for a successor to CEO Constance Lau in a November letter to stakeholders, arguing it needed a shift in corporate culture. ValueAct also raised concerns that the company wouldn’t reach its renewable targets.“As an island economy, sustainability is must,” Ubben said. “It is an inspired place, with legislative and regulatory leadership that wants to reward innovation. Hawaiian Electric management and board have taken on the challenge to move faster off of base-load oil.”The San Francisco-based hedge fund disclosed its original stake in Hawaiian Electric in October 2018 through the Spring Fund. Total shareholder returns since ValueAct disclosed its position have been about 38%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Last month, Ubben, the founder of ValueAct, was replaced as CEO of the activist firm by Mason Morfit. Ubben remains chairman and will continue to help run the Spring Fund.&#92;--With assistance from Laura Hurst.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Michael HythaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Ubben’s ValueAct Capital Buys Into BP On Carbon-Cutting Pledge

2020-02-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. gained as much as 2.1%, the most since mid-January, after hosting its first investor day in three years on Tuesday. Analysts pointed to strong growth trends and new ways to boost consumer payment flows.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:Morgan Stanley, James FaucetteThe investor day “should help quell concerns from potential investors over disruption risk, as Visa showed its integral role in perpetuating industry growth, including for fintechs, banks and acquirers,” Faucette wrote in a note.“The consumer payments runway looks robust,” he added, with long-term “opportunity to monetize other payment flows.” Visa has also “cemented its position as a key promoter of faster digital payments by highlighting its work with transit systems, remittance companies.” At the same time, Faucette said there may be some “noise” ahead from foreign exchange and volumes growth in China. He rates the stock overweight with a price target of $240.Bernstein, Harshita RawatIn comparison to Visa’s last investor day three years ago, there was an “immense focus on, granularity of strategy and visible progress towards the next leg of growth – expansion into new flows,” Rawat wrote in a note.She added that Visa “hammered home the secular growth opportunity in consumer-to-business payments with interesting spotlights on battleground areas such as emerging markets (e.g., India) and cash-heavy developed markets (e.g., Germany, Japan).” And contactless and e-commerce remain “powerful catalysts for cash digitization,” she said.Bernstein remains bullish on Visa and believes the “investor day will start to change the narrative on slower growth versus Mastercard.”KBW, Sanjay Sakhrani“The company did a solid job making the case that the growth story remains strong and the future is as bright as the past,” Sakhrani wrote in a note. The steps Visa is taking to be “more accessible (via partnerships), robust (via the network of network strategy) and deeper (through value-added services) is a formula that will yield significant returns,” he added.Sakhrani still sees Visa as a “compelling long-term growth story” and reiterated his outperform rating and $245 price target.Nomura Instinet, Bill CarcacheCarcache believes Visa’s “three-pronged strategy positions it to sustain double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth for years to come.”At the same time, he added that the company’s investments are likely to keep expense growth elevated in the near-term. He reiterated his buy rating on the shares.UBS, Eric Wasserstrom“The central theme of Visa’s investor day was that, by virtue of its pivot to become a network-of-networks, it is evolving from a consumer payments company to a broader money movement ecosystem,” Wasserstrom wrote.That pivot may extend Visa’s “relevance into several new payment flows – opening significant new TAM – and the financial implication is that Visa should sustain low double digit revenue growth longer term,” he said. The investor day affirmed Wasserstrom’s “focus on the opportunities from new flows,” but didn’t alter his current financial forecasts.To contact the reporter on this story: Felice Maranz in New York at fmaranz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Steven Fromm, Scott SchnipperFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Visa Rises as Wall Street Likes Its Post-Investor Day Potential

2020-02-21,"It was a miserable end to the week for equities as investors ditched riskier assets for safe-haven fare, such as the dollar and gold. Yes, that's correct. Despite the U.S. Dollar Index popping today, dollar-denominated gold closed at multi-year highs while stocks tumbled.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 slid 1.05%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 0.78%.  * The Nasdaq Composite plunged 1.79%.  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the worst-performing Dow name today, underscoring weakness across the large-cap tech space.Covid-19 concerns were again at the center of the broader market decline, but as was noted yesterday, markets are getting wise to the fact that this issue isn't confined to China -- or Asia for that matter -- and data are confirming as much.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier today, the IHS Markit purchasing managers' index for February checked in at 49.6, a decline of 3.7 points from January and good for the worst reading in more than six years.The weakness &quot;was in part linked to the coronavirus outbreak, manifesting itself in weakened demand across sectors such as travel and tourism, as well as via falling exports and supply chain disruptions,&quot; according to IHS Markit.  * 7 Delicious Restaurant Stocks to Buy In late trading, 21 of the Dow's 30 components were lower and more than half that group were down 1% or more. Conversely, none of the winners were up 1%. Coke And CoronavirusBefore jumping into Friday's tech wreck, let's have a look at Dow component Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). The defensive stock was up about half a percent in late trading, but investors may do well to not be deceived here.The company became the latest to warn that the novel coronavirus will affect its earnings, warning of a modest impact to first-quarter results. Fortunately, the soft drink giant said it still expects to earn $2.25 a share this year.That's likely the reason why Coca-Cola traded higher today. That and its status as a defensive name. Including Coca-Cola, three of the Dow's four consumer staples residents were in the green today. Usual SuspectsAlthough company-specific news for many of the following names was light to non-existent today, China-sensitive names such as Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were among the Dow's worst offenders.In fact, all of the Dow's technology constituents traded lower today. The only Dow Jones stock with significant China exposure that was higher, and only modestly so, was Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). That was more a sympathy play on Deere & Company's (NYSE:DE) strong earnings report than anything else. Visa VexedVisa (NYSE:V) couldn't escape the tech carnage today, though there was one encouraging news item out on the name. Brazilian state-controlled bank Caixa Economica Federa is working with Visa on credit and debit cards in that country. That bank issues 109.3 million of those cards and Brazil is Latin America's largest economy. Speaking of Credit CardsAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) was another Dow offender and this is very much a coronavirus-to-blame situation. With global travel expected to slump due to the virus, AXP could be pinched.AXP is one of Warren Buffett's &quot;big four&quot; holdings and the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) annual shareholder letter, always widely anticipated, is due out this weekend, so there could be some AXP commentary in there. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayBeyond the coronavirus, there's another issue that could act as a headwind for stocks: they're getting expensive as John Butters of FactSet points out.&quot;The forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.0 on February 19 was above the four most recent historical averages for the S&P 500: five-year (16.7), 10-year (14.9), 15-year (14.6), and 20-year (15.5),&quot; said Butters in a note. &quot;In fact, this marked the first time the forward 12- month P/E had been equal to (or above) 19.0 since May 23, 2002 (19.1).&quot;Of course, equities can get pricey and continue climbing, but a more sanguine environment than one riddled by fatal illnesses is probably necessary for that to happen.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Mastercard Inc. lowered its three-week-old forecast for quarterly revenue growth as the spreading coronavirus curbs international travel and even takes a bite out of e-commerce, a business executives had hoped would be immune.The credit-card network said it’s knocking 2 to 3 percentage points off the prediction it made on an earnings conference call Jan. 29. That translates to growth of 9% to 10% on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions, it said Monday. Shares of Mastercard and Visa Inc. dropped in after-hours trading.“Cross-border travel, and to a lesser extent cross-border e-commerce growth, is being impacted,” Mastercard said in a statement. “There are many unknowns as to the duration and severity of the situation and we are closely monitoring it.”The short-lived forecast underscores how quickly the virus is altering consumer behavior as it moves beyond China. Mastercard executives had previously taken comfort in the fact that much of the firm’s business into and out of China is e-commerce, which could potentially continue amid measures to contain the disease.“It provides some level of a hedge,” Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra had told analysts on Jan. 29. But even back then, Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga quickly cautioned that the firm would “take a look at those numbers once again” if the crisis worsened and affected more parts of the globe.On Monday, United Airlines Holdings Inc. withdrew its 2020 profit forecast, also citing the virus.Mastercard’s shares fell 4.4% during regular trading Monday after a spike in infections in countries including South Korea and Italy triggered a global selloff. The stock then dropped an additional 1.1% after hours at 6:30 p.m. in New York. Visa fell 1.7%.If the impact of the virus is limited to the first quarter, annual net revenue growth will probably be at the low end of the low-teens range, Mastercard said on Monday, noting that it plans to give further updates on its next earnings call.Visa CEO Al Kelly told investors at his company’s investor day Feb. 11 that it was “too early to tell” what impact the virus might have on results.“But if planes are not flying in and out of China, if hotels are not being filled -- which they’re not at the moment -- and if the supply chains are being impacted -- which I suspect they are -- there is going to be some impact,” Kelly said.(Updates with stock moves, background on forecast and Visa from second paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Jenny Surane in New York at jsurane4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

2020-02-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Intuit Inc., the software giant behind TurboTax, is buying personal finance website Credit Karma Inc. for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock.San Francisco-based Credit Karma has garnered more than 100 million users by offering free credit scores since it was founded in 2007. The financial technology startup offers other services too, including the ability to apply for a credit card, find an auto loan or start a savings account. The combination will help consumers manage debt, maximize savings and have better access to credit cards and loans, Intuit said in a statement Monday.Fintech companies are at a crossroads where a number of them are established enough to go public, but a spate of poor-performing IPOs are making acquisitions more attractive. At the same time, incumbent companies aren’t afraid to snap up startups as a way to fuel their own growth. “The fertile M&A market, shift to growth stage investments, and rich valuations open the door for a lot of discussions, as well as distractions,” said Lindsay Davis, an analyst at CB Insights. “Fintech startups will have a choice to take a deal or buckle down and focus on filling product gaps.”Perhaps most similar to Intuit, Credit Karma also launched a free tax-filing platform a few years ago and has been trying to poach customers of Intuit’s TurboTax offering.More than 30 million users log into Credit Karma every week, the company has said. These users don’t pay the company for any of its services, and Credit Karma makes money through an affiliate fee it receives when someone successfully applies for a loan or credit card on its platform. Credit Karma generated almost $1 billion in unaudited revenue last year, up 20% from 2018, Intuit said.Intuit also reported fiscal second-quarter results, with revenue up 13% in the period to $1.7 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.68 billion. Net income rose 27% to $240 million, or 91 cents a share, in the three months ended Jan. 31. The company reiterated its fiscal 2020 outlook for revenue of $7.44 billion to $7.54 billion. The transaction is expected to be neutral or add to Intuit’s adjusted earnings per share in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes, the company said.The deal is only the latest in a slew of acquisitions in the industry. Morgan Stanley recently announced plans to buy E*Trade Financial Corp. for $13 billion, while Visa Inc. agreed to acquire Plaid for $5.3 billion in January.Late last year, PayPal Holdings Inc. snapped up online coupon company Honey Science Corp. for $4 billion and Charles Schwab Corp. is acquiring TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. for $26 billion.QED Investors, Ribbit Capital and Founders Fund were early backers of Credit Karma.(Updates with Intuit earnings results in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Julie Verhage in New York at jverhage2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Linus Chua, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Intuit Buys Credit Karma for $7.1 Billion in Cash, Stock"

2020-02-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the trendiest ideas in finance is something called “social impact investing,” which is the idea that people should put more money into socially beneficial companies and products, and less into socially harmful ones. That hardly sounds objectionable, but I am skeptical about how much good social impact investing can do.The first risk is that social impact investing will be used to “whitewash” various harmful policies. By divesting from a particular set of companies, an investment fund loses at most a very small benefit from an additional degree of broader market diversification. The fund still is likely to earn the market rate of return on its other investments, and in the meantime it can claim virtuousness. At the same time, the funds can pursue socially harmful policies elsewhere: investing in companies that lobby for tariff protection, say, or emit less visible forms of pollution, or how about refined sugar?A second risk is that social impact investing simply redistributes wealth from investments — maybe to less socially conscientious individuals. Imagine a socially conscious investment firm that declines to participate in the initial public offering of a company that pollutes the ocean. That might create downward pressure on the price of the IPO. But there is a problem: The value of the actual investment has not declined, so at a potentially lower IPO price other investors will step in to fill the demand. In fact, those investors may have the chance to buy at a discount and earn a higher return than otherwise.The net result is that conscientious investors have missed out on a profitable opportunity, while less socially aware investors have earned more. Over time, the less socially aware investors will become richer, and their greater wealth may translate into greater political and economic influence.Maybe this effect isn’t large, but it is negative, and it will become correspondingly larger to the extent social impact investing becomes more popular (in 2018, the money pouring into sustainable investment funds quadrupled, rising to about $21 billion). That doesn’t sound like an appealing trade-off.But put that worry aside and assume that social impact investing simply makes it easier to get a solar power company off the ground with an IPO or an expansion. It’s still not clear that much has been gained. At that late point in the process, the company will succeed or it won’t, no matter what the socially conscious funds do.If anything, it would be more useful to have socially conscious research and development at the very early stages of projects. To some extent there are such investments, and I am more sanguine about being conscientious then than when companies already exist and funds are making investment decisions.It is also difficult to monitor the performance and social efficacy of the funds focused on doing good. In actively managed sustainable equity funds, for example, the most commonly held stocks are estimated to be Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa, Apple and Cisco. I have nothing against those companies, but you have to wonder exactly how much social improvement those investment funds are buying.Norway’s fossil fuel divestment is well-publicized. Less well known is that it exempted Shell and Exxon. There simply aren’t clear benchmarks for which investments to avoid, and of course some critics will portray technology companies as the embodiment of evil.Too many of the empirical arguments for social impact investing stem from a single example: South Africa under apartheid. In that case, a coordinated campaign of divestment and international economic and social pressure did hasten the end of apartheid, all for the better. But most sanctions are not very effective at achieving their stated political goals, or their effectiveness may be unclear. South Africa may have been a special case because it was relatively small and isolated, and because so many South Africans had ceased to believe in apartheid.Investment in socially beneficial activities can be worthwhile. But it ignores the question of who decides what is “beneficial,” and it is yet another example of how politics and media are becomingly increasingly performative. Everything is about looking good instead of substance. It is increasingly difficult for businesses and investment funds to perform their proper work under the glare of perpetual debate and periodic condemnation.The notion of extending that same glare to economic investments makes is hardly reassuring.

2020-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Ken Lin co-founded Credit Karma Inc. in 2007 after struggling to find out his own credit score. That’s something he probably won’t need in the future.Intuit Inc. -- the software giant behind TurboTax -- said Monday it’s buying Credit Karma for about $7.1 billion in cash and stock. The firm, which offers free credit scores and help applying for cards and loans, has more than 100 million members and reported unaudited revenue of nearly $1 billion in 2019, according to a company statement.Lin, 44, who owns at least 15% of the San Francisco-based company, is poised for a ten-figure windfall, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the latest fintech founder to strike gold in recent months as more established firms snap up upstarts.It caps a remarkable rise for Lin, who as a child immigrated to the U.S. from China with his parents and was the first of his family to graduate from college. The founder is far from the stereotypical staid financial planner. Described as an adrenaline junkie, he once took his company’s board on dune buggy rides in Las Vegas and is known for hitting the dance floor at his firm’s holiday parties.Credit Karma declined to comment on Lin’s net worth.Others geting windfalls include co-founders Nichole Mustard, 47, and Ryan Graciano, 38, as well as firms such as Silver Lake, Ribbit Capital and QED Investors, a Virginia-based outfit that led the first investment round.The startup’s hefty price tag contrasts with its early days.It initially struggled to raise funding from venture capitalists and its first office was an apartment located by a San Francisco overpass and above Kate O’Brien’s Irish Bar & Grill. The company has since moved to fancier digs near Union Square whose amenities include a nail salon.While Silicon Valley has witnessed plenty of lackluster public offerings recently, there’s still demand for financial tech companies from larger rivals.George Ruan and Ryan Hudson, the co-founders of Honey Science Corp. pulled in $1.5 billion after completing the $4 billion sale of their firm to PayPal Holdings Inc.

2020-02-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called the coronavirus a “challenge” for the iPhone maker during a pep talk for shareholders at the company’s annual meeting.The effects of the virus, which have closed factories and stores throughout China, pose significant issues for the technology giant. Apple produces hundreds of millions of devices each year in China. Earlier this month, the company said it wouldn’t meet its revenue forecast of more $63 billion for the current quarter, citing iPhone supply constraints and lost retail sales in China.Apple has since re-opened about 30 of its 42 stores in China. Suppliers and mass assembly partners are also slowly coming back up to speed, but some analysts have said the fallout could spill into the quarter ending in June.In prepared remarks Wednesday at Apple’s shareholder meeting at Cupertino, California, Cook said annual revenue from wearables such as the AirPods and Apple Watch compares with that of Marriott International Inc. plus Visa Inc. -- more than $40 billion. Apple reported $10 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue for its wearables, home and accessories unit.Answering questions from the audience, Cook said for the first time that Apple would open its online store in India this year, with the first retail stores opening in the country in 2021.He also made his first public comments about the company’s rejection of the U.S. government’s request to unlock iPhones belonging to the shooter behind the December 2019 attack that killed three people in Pensacola, Florida. “Don’t think we have something that we’re not giving,” he said, adding that Apple wouldn’t create a backdoor to break into its devices.On a much lighter note, Cook was asked why the company didn’t acquire the rights to the show “Friends” for its TV+ streaming service. The CEO said the company is focused on developing original shows rather than buying old offerings.Cook’s comments at shareholder meetings sometimes can hint at future products. At the 2019 meeting, Cook said there was “long, great road map of fantastic” AirPods ahead. New AirPods launched just weeks later, followed by the AirPods Pro in October.The top Apple executive didn’t specify any future products, but the company is working on new iPhones with 5G for later this year, Bloomberg News has reported. It’s also planning to launch a virtual-reality headset as early as 2021. It’s unclear whether those plans may be affected by the coronavirus outbreak.Shareholders re-elected Apple’s board, which includes Cook and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple’s Tim Cook Calls Coronavirus a ‘Challenge’ at Shareholder Talk

2020-02-27,"When the market dips, you want to pick up fast-growing dividend stocks at a bargain. That is what happened this past week. As a result, these five super-fast-growing dividend stocks have become cheap.In putting this article together, I wanted to focus only on stocks whose dividends have grown 20% or faster in the past three to five years. That's because when the market returns to normal, these kinds of stocks tend to jump back up quickly.Moreover, the underlying reason their dividends are growing so fast is that the companies' earnings and/or free cash flow are rising at a fast pace. In other words, the payout ratios tend to stay flat, and the dividends are rising because the underlying earnings or cash flow are growing fast.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Last Week These stocks also tend to be fairly liquid, feature large market caps and have earnings which cover the dividends. Fast-Growing Dividend Stocks: Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 4.6%3-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 39.3%5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 51.3%Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor device and software solutions company. It is the world's second-largest fabless semiconductor company.AVGO stock has a $112 billion market capitalization and is also very cheap. It sells for about a 12x price-earnings ratio.Moreover, its dividend yield is very high at 4.6%. Broadcom's $13 dividend is well covered by its forward expected earnings of $23.27, according to Seeking Alpha.As the chart above shows, dividends have grown on average 39.3% over the past three years and 51.3% over five years. .The company has been growing through acquisitions. Broadcom tried to buy Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) three years ago. It was prevented by the President Donald Trump Administration, since Chinese interests had majority control of Broadcom.Broadcom also acquired CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in 2018. It also recently closed on the $10.7 billion purchase of the enterprise security business from Symantec.Analysts are generally positive on AVGO and expect higher revenue and earnings for the year ending October. This should continue to lead to high dividend growth over the next several years. VISA (V)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 0.6%3-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 20.3%5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 19.1%VISA (NYSE:V) is a $404 billion market cap payments company. Everybody knows about Visa. But most do not know that it is not a bank.  It makes its money from transaction fees and licensing fees.Visa stock is not necessarily cheap at 30 times earnings, but its earnings and dividends have been growing very fast. Moreover, its expected earnings per share of $6.14 this year cover the dividend per share of $1.20.Visa had very strong results for 2019. In its most recent earnings report, transaction volumes were up 11% year-over-year, revenues rose 10% and EPS was up 12%.Moreover, analysts expect 2020 earnings per share for the year ending September will be 15.4% higher at $6.14 per share. For 2021 they expect an additional 17% spike in EPS growth to $7.18 per share.So the $1.20 annual dividend per share, which represents just 20% of the expected fiscal year 2020 earnings, has plenty of room to grow.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy on the Coronavirus Dip Watch for good things to happen to the stock as the dividend is hiked. Visa usually raises the dividend once a year in July, so keep an eye out around then. Mastercard (MA)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 0.5%3-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 22.1%5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 20.1%Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is a $295 billion market cap payments company. Just like Visa, it has superb earnings and dividends growth, as it is essentially in the same business.Also like Visa, Mastercard is not particularly cheap, but its dividends are growing quickly. MA stock trades for 33 times forward earnings. But the earnings are highly priced for their growth.For example, MA's earnings per share will grow over 12.5% this year, according to analysts polled by Seeking Alpha. This is after earning rose 42% in the year ending December 2019.Moreover, 2021 expected earnings growth is 20%. Therefore, the $1.60 dividend is well covered by this year's expected $7.94 EPS. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 5.3%3-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 22.8%5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 18.5%AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is a roughly $130 billion market cap drug stock which is very cheap. It has a 5.2% dividend yield and a forward price-earnings ratio of just 9 times.Moreover, its $4.72 annual dividend per share is well covered by the prospective earnings of $9.88 according to Seeking Alpha. This is important since the dividends have been growing very fast over the past three to five years. As the table shows above, dividends have grown on average 22.8% over the past three years and 18.5% over five years.AbbVie's purchase of Allergan, expected to close shortly, will boost earnings and dividends and push ABBV stock higher. Allergan is well known for its Botox and other beauty products. Analysts suggest that it will only take a few more months.AbbVie is losing its patent protection on Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment that accounts for close to half of AbbVie's revenue.  * 8 of the Best Stocks to Buy for ESG Investors But the company has indicated that there will be $2 billion in synergies with Allergan. Moreover, the combined earnings will be 10% higher during the first year. Texas Instruments (TXN)Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Dividend Yield: 3.04%3-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 19.3%5-Year Dividend Growth Rate: 20.8%Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is a $110 billion market-cap company in the fabless semiconductor manufacturing industry, like Broadcom. Earnings have been turning around this year as demand for chips has picked up, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors.TXN stock is cheap at 22.9 times this year's expected earnings, according to Seeking Alpha.Analysts expect earnings this year to be $5.19 per share. This more than covers the dividend per share payment of $3.60.Moreover, Texas Instruments has had a long history of paying dividends. Its dividends have risen for 16 years in a row, which is quite a feat. Expect this to continue with the company's recent turnaround in earnings expectations.In fact, TXN has already paid out two quarters of dividends at the $3.60 annual rate. You can expect another dividend hike announcement in mid-July. This is likely to boost TXN stock further. Summary - Super Fast-Growing Dividend StocksThese five stocks have grown their dividend on an accelerated basis, compared to most other companies.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA For example, the table above shows these dividend stocks have an average dividend growth rate for the past three years of 25%. And over the past five years, the dividends have risen 26% on average.Moreover, the average dividend yield is a healthy 2.8%, which is close to the market average. In effect, you get super-fast dividend growth without having to sacrifice dividend yield by buying this group of dividend stocks.That seems like a pretty good bargain, which is not likely to last long.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-03,"The Federal Reserve revealed a 50-basis point interest rate cut earlier today, but that clearly wasn't enough to help stocks build on Monday's gains. In fact, those gains were all but wiped out as the three major equity indexes slid today.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 gave up 2.81%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.94%  * The Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.99%  * Underscoring fears that the coronavirus from China is a massive headwind to the global travel and leisure industries, American Express (NYSE:AXP) slid 5.2% to rank as the Dow's worst-performing name todayUsually, Fed rate cuts are meaningful and today's half a percent reduction is double the 25 basis points investors became accustomed to last year. However, investors may have been focusing more on what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said than what he did and what he said was important.Powell noted that the U.S. economy remains firm, but acknowledged that the coronavirus will put a damper on economic activity &quot;for some time.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdditionally, some market participants view the Fed announcing a rate cut that did not coincide with a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting as a sign of panic, perhaps adding fuel to the fire of today's declines rather than having the more desired, opposite effect.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy on Coronavirus Weakness, According to Wedbush Overall, it was a brutal day with 29 of the 30 Dow stocks lower in late trading. Little Impact Part IIWhile the Fed rate cut announcement clearly had no positive effect on stocks today, one sector seemed to gloss over another pertinent reveal. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and rival Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were among the Dow's worst offenders despite news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is moving toward another output cut.The cartel will pare production by 600,000 barrels per day as the oil prices sag in the wake of the coronavirus. That comes after a 1.7 million barrel per day reduction late last year, but it obviously wasn't enough to prop up wilting oil stocks like Chevron and Exxon. Speaking of Credit CardsAs noted above, American Express was a big-time Dow loser today, but it wasn't alone in terms of credit card equity weakness. Fellow Dow component Visa (NYSE:V) was part of that group. Not surprisingly, Visa cited the coronavirus as the culprit behind weaker card volumes and the company doesn't expect this situation to get better over the near term.&quot;Cross-border growth rates have deteriorated week by week since the coronavirus outbreak in China, and trends through February 28, 2020 do not yet fully reflect the impact of the coronavirus spreading outside of Asia,&quot; according to Visa. Fed WoesThe Fed rate cut did have an expected impact for at least one sector, but that's not good news. Already under pressure due to net interest income margin concerns attributable to the Fed's 2019 rate cuts, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) traded lower today on the rate cut news.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wasn't immune from that rate-sensitive downswing, joining JPM among the roughly 20 Dow members that lost at 2% today. Maybe Some ReliefOne certainly wouldn't guess it by looking at UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) today, but some analysts believe the healthcare sector can spring back to life following today's Super Tuesday primaries.Goldman Sachs analyst Asad Haider said markets have ascribed too high a level of certainty that Sen. Bernie Sanders will be the Democratic nominee. Haider believes the field is wide open and that the results from today's primaries could confirm, potentially providing some relief to the S&P 500's second-largest sector weight. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayOne of the prevailing coronavirus-related themes is that many market observers believe this situation will be temporary. They're right, but no one can say for sure when economic activity will bounce, whether it be next quarter or further into the year. However, the lack of clarity itself is a drag on markets.&quot;We see the drag on economic activity as temporary, with underlying economic fundamentals still supportive of the global economic expansion,&quot; according to BlackRock. &quot;The risk to this view is that the hit to economies from the outbreak and containment measures undermines fundamentals and triggers the end of this cycle.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

The company disclosed in a Monday filing that the coronavirus was having a &quot;significant impact&quot; on Asia-related travel that has caused a &quot;sharp slowdown of our cross-border business&quot; for both card-present and card-not-present travel spending. Visa said that cross-border e-commerce spending unrelated to travel hasn't seen a significant negative impact, expect in certain Asia markets. &quot;In markets where Visa processes the majority of our transactions, domestic spending growth, both credit and debit, remains largely stable with the exception of some impact in Hong Kong and Singapore,&quot; the company said in its filing. Visa joins Mastercard Inc.  and PayPal Holdings Inc. , both of which warned in recent weeks of negative coronavirus impacts.

2020-03-04,"(Bloomberg) -- In the U.S., Super Tuesday established two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. If things continue the way they’re going, the Democratic party will be left with a choice between Joe Biden, who has alternately criticized and praised the tech industry, and Bernie Sanders, who incites near-panic within some Silicon Valley circles.Biden is widely seen as friendly to the tech industry. That’s a testament to how heated the criticism of tech has become. In January, Biden said he’d like to revoke legislation that’s perhaps the most important piece of technology policy on the books—a 1996 law that shields internet companies from lawsuits related to content posted by their users. He singled out one person in particular during an interview with the New York Times editorial board: “I’ve never been a big Zuckerberg fan. I think he’s a real problem.”But Biden’s criticisms are often couched with a degree of deference. At a fundraiser held by Amazon.com Inc.’s general counsel in November, he acknowledged the economic disruption the company had caused while taking pains not to blame it, according to the Seattle Times. “Seriously, think of the change that is taking place and why people are frightened. Nothing bad—you’ve done good things,” he said. “But 200,000 salespeople are out of work because people are shopping online now.”A central part of Biden’s pitch has been a promise to continue the policies of the Obama administration, which was markedly friendly to Silicon Valley. Biden has said the government should “take a really hard look” at breaking up technology companies but also said it’s premature to take action.Sanders, by contrast, has said he’d “absolutely” aim to break up companies like Amazon, Facebook Inc. and Google. He also reliably takes the tech-critical side of most policy debates. Sanders wants to cease the use of facial recognition and algorithmic decision-making in criminal justice and has called for new rules about how tech companies collect and sell their users’ personal data.An instructive—and threatening—part of Sanders’s approach to tech policy is his philosophy on labor. Sanders has been a strong advocate for California’s contested law designed to require Uber Technologies Inc. and other gig-economy companies to classify their workers as full-time employees. (He has said he’d push similar laws to the federal level.) Sanders wants to increase the minimum wage and force companies to give stock to workers who lose their jobs to automation or offshoring. Sanders also wants large companies to allocate a significant amount of the seats on their boards to people voted in by their employees.In each case, Sanders wants to take power from executives and redistribute it to rank-and-file employees. (“Billionaires shouldn’t exist,” he has said.) This is a direct shot at a core aspect of Silicon Valley’s ethos, which values the heroic founder as a primary force for progress in the world and one deserving of enormous wealth. Even if few of Sanders’s policies have a realistic chance of being implemented as described, the atmosphere that a Sanders administration would create has tech’s capitalist class re-examining its hostility toward President Donald Trump.One faction of the tech industry that finds Sanders’s vision more intriguing is the workers he’d like to empower. They’re not exactly the proletariat now. While they’d fork over more in taxes if Sanders had his way, his politics jibe with the increasing calls from workers at Google and other big companies for a greater say in decision-making. Sanders has raised far more money from employees of large tech companies than any other candidate—his $727,000 is more than eight times the amount Biden has raised, according to a recent analysis of public data by the Guardian. Super Tuesday, the most consequential day of the primary season, left Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bloomberg trailing far behind. Warren’s positions on technology issues are well-known. Bloomberg’s are less so. (Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.)For the two leading candidates, the biggest difference may be the depth of feeling they inspire. Sanders has long engendered deep loyalty and fierce hostility. Biden, by contrast, hasn’t been a subject of much political discussion in Silicon Valley, even as Warren, Andrew Yang and Pete Buttigieg have all had turns in the spotlight. That might be about to change.If you read one thingFacebook is scaling back its ambitions for a cryptocurrency. The project, called Libra, inspired widespread concern among policymakers and ran into issues almost immediately. Several high profile partners, including Visa and Mastercard, have dropped out. Now those building Libra are weighing a recast as mostly a payments network that could operate with multiple coins, which might not seem much different from existing offerings from companies like PayPal Holdings Inc.And here’s what you need to know in global technology newsCandidates have been pushing the limits of social media companies’ rules during the 2020 campaign.An Amazon employee at headquarters in Seattle has contracted the coronavirus, and Google’s I/O conference is the latest tech gathering to be cancelled. To contact the author of this story: Joshua Brustein in New York at jbrustein@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Vlad SavovFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bernie Sanders vs. Joe Biden: Where They Stand on Tech Issues

2020-03-12,"With the coronavirus death tally surpassing 1,000 in Italy -- the Eurozone's third-largest economy -- and little clarity on when the U.S. will get a handle on the situation, stocks continue sliding in dramatic fashion today, confirming the end of one of history's most glorified bull markets as of Wednesday.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 tumbled 9.51%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 9.99%  * The Nasdaq Composite gave up 9.43%  * Familiar offenders Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) were vying for the dubious honor of worst-performing Dow stock today, though International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) was in that ominous mix as well.There's an old saying in financial circles that goes something like &quot;history doesn't always repeat, but it often rhymes.&quot; Assuming that's true, and it often is, add history to the list of hurdles currently confounding stocks because history says that only twice over the past 93 years -- 1966 and 1987 -- was a 20% or more decline in the S&P 500 not followed by U.S. economic contraction a year later.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo there's hope tto cling to, because the recession indicator, like every other indicator, doesn't come with a 100% rate of repeat. However, hope maybe a dangerous tonic these days when acknowledging that equity markets are leading, not lagging indicators, meaning they're usually reliable gauges of economic conditions.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off And we're back to a familiar place: not one of the Dow's 30 member firms were higher in late trading. Worse yet, roughly 10 were saddled with or close to double-digit losses. Boeing Bad News ContinuesAt this point, anything even remotely resembling good news regarding Boeing would be shocking. Alas, more bad news it is. Earlier today, JPMorgan downgraded the beleaguered industrial stock to &quot;neutral&quot; from &quot;overweight&quot; while lowering its price target to $160 from $210.Problem with that price target is it could be violated to the downside while I'm writing this piece or as soon as Friday. At this writing, Boeing resides just over $160 and is on pace for its lowest closing handle since early 2017. Weird Disney SituationAny speculation that Disney (NYSE:DIS) would be an anti-coronavirus play due to its streaming exposure has long been out the window, but the stock was among the double-digit loser club today amid some interesting news.Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and California health officials recommended that business, groups and anyone else planning a gathering of 250 or more people scrap those events. However, that advisory doesn't pertain to theme parks, including Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif..That's all well and good, but DIS stock paints a picture of markets suspecting that no one wants to go to Disneyland and Disney World amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Even if they do, it's raining in Southern California and that should rightly keep some folks at home. Misplaced Rosy AssumptionsVisa (NYSE:V) was pounded today, though it wasn't in the double-digit loser club, after Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Donat said outlooks from Visa and rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are too optimistic given the coronavirus outbreak.&quot;We now expect COVID-19 to have a more negative impact,&quot; said Donat in a note to clients. &quot;We now think that the revised outlooks for both companies are overly optimistic…However, with the virus spreading to Europe and North America, we now expect impacts not just on cross-border activity but also on domestic spending activity&quot;Weakness in V and MA today could easily be one reason why American Express (NYSE:AXP) was one of the worst-performing Dow stocks on Thursday as well. Caterpillar Cranks LowerConfirming speculation that the global economy is under substantial duress, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) slumped 9% reported the weakest machine sales since late 2016.CAT stock is lower by about 40% year-to-date and the industrial machinery giant is off to its worst start to a year since 2009. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayArguably the biggest risk now facing stocks, beyond the obvious of lack of COVID-19 containment, is that monetary policy response to the situation isn't being embraced by investors. Today, the Federal Reserve said it plans to inject at least $1 trillion into the banking system as soon as next week and it's pledging to buy more bonds.However, today's market action suggests investors want more and after a recent 50-basis point interest rate cut was greeted with muted reaction, the Fed may have no choice but to buy more bonds in a bid to stave off a lengthy recession.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-13,"U.S. stocks have plunged nearly 20% in about a month on fears that the coronavirus from China  will materially slow economic activity and could tip the global economy into a recession. Very few stocks are being spared in this selloff. Even traditionally strong payments stocks like Visa (NYSE:V) stock have tumbled.Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com From its mid-February highs, V stock has shed over 20%.When it comes to this selloff of Visa stock, there are two important truths.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFirst, as long as coronavirus hysteria dominates the minds of consumers and investors, Visa stock will keep dropping. Secondly, once coronavirus hysteria passes, Visa stock will rebound with significant velocity.So buying the dip of Visa stock is the smart move,  but only once fears about the coronavirus  pass. It remains unclear when those fears will pass, and as long as this lack of clarity persists, the stock won't bounce back. Coronavirus Hysteria Will Hurt VisaAt first, the coronavirus outbreak was largely contained to China. When the virus was only circulating there, Visa had to adjust its second-quarter revenue growth rate guidance lower by about three percentage points, citing a drop in cross-border business in Asia and lower travel spending.Now the virus is a global problem impacting not just China, but almost every country around the world.  * 7 Stocks to Sell as We Enter a Bear Market Naturally, Visa's cross-border business will take a hit across the globe, as consumers around the world choose to stay at home more and reduce their spending. In that world, Visa's growth will drop. Its revenue and profits may even fall to 0% for a few weeks.Against that backdrop, Visa stock won't work. It is a growth stock (traditionally its revenue increases 10%-plus annually) with a growth valuation of 28 times its forward earnings. The company needs to sustain 10%-plus revenue growth in order for the stock to rise.As long as coronavirus hysteria forces consumers to curtail their spending, Visa won't generate 10%-plus revenue growth and Visa stock won't head higher. Visa Stock Will Bounce BackIn the long run, Visa stock will bounce back from the coronavirus selloff.That's because, as big and as scary as COVID-19 is, it's a temporary problem. Within a few months, strict quarantining slowed the virus' spread in South Korea and China. Warmer weather should also help stop the virus from spreading in April or May. Even further, multiple companies have developed potential vaccines, and it's likely that by 2021, a treatment for the virus will be widely available.All in all, then, I think it's quite likely that by summer, the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. -- and across the globe -- will be largely under control.If so, consumer spending trends will rebound tremendously, supported by tons of fiscal and monetary stimulus. That rebound in consumer spending will cause Visa's revenue growth rates to jump back into double-digit-percentage territory. Rebounding growth will lead to a rebounding stock, and Visa stock could very easily march back towards the $200 level in a hurry. The Bottom Line on V StockAt some point, the decline of Visa stock will become a buying opportunity  because COVID-19 is a temporary problem, and Visa is a long-term winner.But I don't think we are at that point yet. Instead, it feels like there will be more more negative news ahead on the coronavirus front. As long as the headlines remain negative -- and the virus keeps spreading at an exponential rate globally -- Visa stock will struggle to rebound.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

It also offers income-hungry investors a solid dividend. The Coronavirus Is Shaving ProfitsRemember where we were just a couple of weeks ago: Visa was soaring over $210 per share while being a consistent winner for investors.  * 7 Stocks to Sell as We Enter a Bear Market From the time of its IPO until before the coronavirus from China-induced selloff, V stock was up 1,200% from its IPO. It was making money from the transactions of more than 3.3 billion credit cards around the world.But things change fast when something as horrid as a global pandemic comes in play. Visa announced this week that it will take a revenue hit of 2.5% to 3.5% in the second quarter. The virus is particularly impacting its cross-border business.&quot;Cross-border growth rates have deteriorated week by week since the coronavirus outbreak in China, and trends through Feb. 28, 2020 do not yet fully reflect the impact of the coronavirus spreading outside of Asia,&quot; Visa said. &quot;As such, we anticipate that this deteriorating trend has not bottomed out yet.&quot;Visa had originally predicted net revenue growth in the second quarter to be in the low double digits, so it's possible that the company will see revenue fall below the 10% it recorded in the fiscal first quarter.That's not great news for Visa, but it's important to acknowledge. Visa is doing the responsible thing in managing Wall Street's expectations. This way there won't be a negative surprise when it reports earnings again in April. Visa's Business Will Bounce BackVisa and any other payment processor is going to fall on some hard times in a bear market. When the economy slows down, fewer people will be swiping their Visa cards while going out to eat or attending concerts.But it's also really important for investors to remember that this bear market is not a result of a bad market. Just a few weeks ago, we were all enjoying record high after record high.The market fundamentals haven't changed. This is a bear market that is based on fear and speculation. As the virus fades away -- and it will fade away -- Visa's business model and plan will remain untouched.The cashless economy -- seen by the growing number of people who are conditioned to carry a credit or debit card instead of cash -- will continue to benefit V stock for the long term.Visa has a history of being a solid, if unspectacular, growth stock. Its earnings rose from $2.49 per share to $5.32 per share in the last three years. And they will continue to rise in the future.

While life will eventually go on and people will begin shopping once again, Visa (NYSE:V) stock may still have downside ahead.Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Don't get me wrong, I love Visa from a company standpoint, and have owned Visa for a very long time. In fact, it's one of the longest-held stocks in my long-term portfolio. I  was lucky enough to pare down that position at $200, and even though I felt silly as the stock continued even higher, that rally felt overdone.Given the latest pullback, I've had an opportunity to once more add to my stake. But I have reservations about building back a full position, even though V stock is 14.5% off its highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Coronavirus and V StockThe coronavirus isn't the only reason I'm concerned about Visa, but it's the one I'll begin with. There seems to be two camps when it comes to the virus. One thinks the world is going to end and the other thinks it's nearly a hoax.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off Those are extreme examples, but that's kind of the point. We have some people stocking up on supplies and others that still won't wash their hands. But one thing that's hard to deny is the economic impact. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) slashing guidance, Delta (NYSE:DAL) reducing capacity and all sorts of events being cancelled are just a few examples.People pay for these services with credit cards. They're not necessarily all Visa cards, but they are cards. As we shift to a cashless society, there's certainly a secular trend for companies like Visa to ride. However, when people stop spending -- even temporarily -- it's a dagger for credit card companies.Management is already acknowledging the impact. On March 2nd, company management said it expects a 2.5% to 3.5% impact to second-quarter revenue. They did not provide a full-year update though, and plan to do so when the company reports earnings.It's hard to be optimistic with so many economic pauses taking place around the world, that a company like Visa won't feel the impact. Oil Prices Are Getting CreamedI expect the economy to be okay, despite the headlines from the virus, stock market and oil prices. At least, that's my glass-half-full approach at this point in time. If plunging oil prices will eventually lead to falling gas prices, and the economy stays relatively healthy, it will be a huge win for U.S. consumers.Maybe that will offset the negative impact Visa feels at the pump. You see, when the price of gas falls, the sum at the gas pump is lower, which hurts the top line for credit card companies. Now maybe consumers make up for that elsewhere -- like the mall -- or maybe they don't.Either way, lower gas prices are surprisingly a risk for V stock and its peers, even as consumers benefit. Peer PanicVisa stock is still well above its 52-week low, which was set one year ago down at $148.02. Obviously that figure will change as we lap the annual range, but it goes to show how well V stock has been holding up.Down 14.5% after Monday's notable market-wide bounce, it's outperforming peers like MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). MasterCard has fallen 19% from its highs, while Amex has dropped more than 25.5% and recently hit new 52-week lows.It's possible that V stock has bottomed, hitting $168.31 on March 9th. If that's the case, then great. Bulls need the stock to reclaim and maintain above its 200-day moving average, then work on getting back above the $190 to $192 area. If it hasn't bottomed, a decline similar to its peers could be in store. a 25% decline from the highs would put V stock down to $160, for reference.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comI could be totally wrong about Visa. With a small position in the name, I hope that I am. But I can't help but be cautious when I see companies cutting guidance, events being cancelled and oil prices falling. Visa will come out of this situation as strong as ever, but I believe the impact will be more than just the second quarter and that V stock could correct further as a result.Will it be enough to thrust it to 52-week lows? Maybe not, but I'm certainly cautious right now.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long AAPL and V.

2020-03-13,"Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) chair Elizabeth Duke and board member James Quigley resigned March 8 under pressure from both the House Financial Services Committee and within the bank itself. WFC stock fell more than 12% on the news.  Source: Shutterstock The resignations came just hours before CEO Charlie Scharf appeared in front of Congress Tuesday to explain how he was working to regain the trust of customers across the country. He was the third Wells Fargo CEO to appear before Congress over the past four years. If this continues, the government's going to have to start charging the bank appearance fees for taking up so much of its time. Oh, wait, it just did that, agreeing to pay $3 billion to the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for all the fake accounts it opened between 2002 and 2016. That was on top of $1.2 billion in previous fines.    InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn the case of Scharf, WFC shareholders can be happy he's an outsider, having served as CEO of Visa (NYSE:V) between November 2012 and December 2016, and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BNY) from July 2017 to October 2019.  * The 10 Best Stocks to Buy After The Market's Historic Sell-Off If anyone can change the corporate culture at Wells Fargo, it would be an outsider like Scharf. To Scharf's credit, he testified that he doesn't expect the changes to be completed until 2021. &quot;I am confident we can move this company in a significantly improved direction,&quot; Scharf said.I guess we'll find out.  There's No Denying 6.2% Yield Makes It AttractiveIn the meantime, Wells Fargo stock yields a juicy 6.2%, a dividend payout that's got InvestorPlace contributor Laura Hoy suggesting it's a stock that every 20-year-old should buy.&quot;Last week, the bank came one step closer to putting the ordeal firmly in the rear-view mirror after agreeing to pay $3 billion in damages. On top of that the firm has replaced its CEO and several board members and completely overhauled its employee compensation structure,&quot; Hoy wrote on March 2. &quot;As the bank emerges from this scandal, it could become a great value play. Not only that, but Wells Fargo offers a dividend yield just shy of 5%.&quot;Of course, since Hoy's article, the coronavirus correction kicked in, sending WFC's share down and its yield up. I get where my colleague's coming from. At 20, even if an investment in Wells Fargo goes south, a young investor has plenty of time to recover those losses. And, yes, Scharf may be the person to right the ship, recouping a big chunk of Warren Buffett's recent paper losses. At the end of December, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) 345.7 million shares of the company were worth $18.6 billion, 2.7 times Berkshire's cost basis of $7.0 billion. However, as I write this, those holdings are worth only $11.4 billion, or just 1.6 times higher than what it paid for the bank's shares.Last May, I wrote an article about Buffett's ongoing support for Wells Fargo. &quot;Buffett's support is excellent news if you own WFC stock, but terrible news if you own stock in Berkshire Hathaway, whose position in WFC stock is its third-largest equity holding,&quot; I wrote May 8. Wells Fargo has since fallen to Berkshire's fifth-largest position behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Oh, how the mighty have fallen. The Bottom Line on WFC StockWhile Buffett's other top bank holdings all yield between 3-5%, Wells Fargo is currently yielding 6.2%, making it an income investor's dream stock. For this reason, it's easy to see how some people could be enticed to own it. If you're one of these people, down almost 34% year to date (including dividends) through March 10, I say buy it.However, if you're like me, and believe in investing in the best company possible, I'd look to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) or Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for your bank investments.Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

2020-03-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Even a global health crisis can’t quell the fight between credit-card companies and retailers over fees.Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and banks that issue credit cards went on high alert Wednesday when the National Restaurant Association asked President Donald Trump and congressional leaders to cut the so-called swipe fees incurred every time a customer pays with plastic.The Electronic Payments Coalition, representing financial firms, held an emergency telephone meeting the same day to discuss strategies for heading off any such proposal, worried it might get tucked into the final version of the massive rescue legislation in the works on Capitol Hill. Congress enacted a similar measure for debit cards in the wake of the 2008 credit crunch. The coalition’s leader, Jeff Tassey, called the new push “unseemly.”“They are advocating in the midst of an economic and health crisis for what a lot of people now realize is a failed policy,” he said. “It never benefited consumers, while at the same time it harmed small banks and credit unions who are on the front line in many communities.”It’s unclear whether the measure will eventually make it into the rescue legislation. But there is no doubt restaurants are in for severe pain, and that many are fighting for survival.The food-service association, which says it advocates on behalf more than 500,000 restaurant businesses, predicted the industry’s sales will plunge by $225 billion over the next three months, leading to the loss of 5 million to 7 million jobs. The group’s letter seeks a wide range of aid, including tax relief and federal loan programs.“Providing short-term relief and longer-term recovery for restaurants and employees means looking at all options in the financial toolbox including grants, effective access to affordable credit, tax relief, easing lease, rent, mortgage and loan payments, reductions in credit card fees and more,” said Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the association.Lobbying associations for other major retailers said they were caught unaware when the request was made.The National Retail Federation isn’t opposed to the idea of capping swipes fees, but the priority for merchants is obtaining more immediate assistance, said Stephanie Martz, the organization’s general counsel. Even if Congress passed interchange limits, the adjustments would probably need to go through a long regulatory process at the Federal Reserve.“We are always in favor of lower overhead, and that’s a big part of our members’ overhead,” she said. “But we’re focused on the crisis right now.”Other RequestsSome merchant groups may ask card companies in the near future to delay planned increases to certain fees and to push back a deadline for gas stations to upgrade fuel pumps to accept chip cards, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The issue of interchange fees has repeatedly flared up in Washington, pitting two constituencies important to lawmakers against each other -- banks versus merchants that range from giants like Target Corp. to the local liquor store. Few on Capitol Hill want to choose sides. The restaurants’ proposal wasn’t included in a draft bill that Republicans released late Thursday.Visa and Mastercard argue the fees are appropriate, noting that the technology that runs the system isn’t free and that consumer confidence in the system is essential. Retailers contend the fees force them to raise prices.For a credit-card transaction, merchants typically pay about 2% of a total purchase and the fee is divvied up by the bank that issued the credit card, the merchant’s payments processor and the card networks. Though the payment may amount to pennies per transaction, the money adds up, providing a major source of revenue to financial firms. Merchants spend more than $100 billion to accept electronic payments a year, according to the Nilson Report, an industry publication.The last time Congress took major action on card fees was in 2010 when the Dodd-Frank Act capped how much big lenders can charge for debit transactions. The law didn’t touch credit cards, which the restaurant association now argues should face similar limits.“The restaurant industry is one of low margins, tight cash flow and a workforce that depends on us for their livelihood,” Sean Kennedy, the group’s executive vice president of public affairs, wrote in the letter. “Without aggressive and immediate action from the federal government, many restaurants that are a staple of local communities will simply never resume service.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Restaurants Push to Cut Credit-Card Fees as Part of U.S. Rescue

2020-03-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. is considering a reprieve for gas stations straining under an October deadline to upgrade their pumps, and, along with Mastercard Inc., delayed a set of fee changes that were to take effect next month.The moves are aimed at sending relief to merchants struggling to remain afloat as the coronavirus puts a virtual halt to global travel and governments order businesses to shut.“Now, more than ever, we’re putting all our power, capabilities, and technology to work to keep commerce flowing,” Seth Eisen, a spokesman for Mastercard, said in a statement. “To help our customers and partners manage through this unprecedented event, we are pausing updates to some systems while delivering the same level of security and service they receive every day.”Visa and Mastercard will delay until July the planned changes to interchange fees, which are paid by retailers each time a consumer swipes their card at checkout.“We are actively implementing and considering a number of ways we can proactively support our clients to ensure the stability, security, reliability and resiliency of the digital payments ecosystem,” said Will Stickney, a spokesman for Visa.The change was welcome news for retailers. The Merchant Advisory Group said the move would “provide needed relief to some of the hardest-hit businesses while ensuring electronic-payment processing continues to work in the seamless fashion as they do today.”Fuel PumpsVisa might also postpone a deadline for gas-station operators to upgrade their fuel pumps to accept chip cards, according to a person familiar with the matter.Fuel retailers currently have until Oct. 1 to upgrade their pumps. Those that don’t will have to start taking on responsibility for the costs related to fraud that happens at their facilities.Merchants have complained that the new machines are costly, and say it’s hard to find workers to install the pumps as more businesses shut because of the virus.“Nobody planned for the disruption of the pandemic delaying everything,” said Dan Rasmussen, a senior vice president at Hughes Network Systems, which helps retailers ready their systems to accept chip cards. Major oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. have been “applying quite a bit of pressure on the retailers to move and get the orders in and start progressing.”The world’s largest payment networks have seen their stocks battered as the pandemic severely curtails spending on the firms’ networks, prompting Mastercard to abandon its full-year revenue guidance this week.Read more about restaurants pushing to lower card feesVisa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly on Thursday pledged his company wouldn’t initiate any layoffs due to the global pandemic in 2020.

He will remain in isolation until receiving further instructions from the health ministry.N.J. Files Charges for Violating Social-Distancing Orders (1:25 p.m. NY)In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy made good on a promise to name and shame people accused of violating social-distancing orders. His attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, sent out a news release detailing cases against a score of people, an unusual move for low-level offenses like disorderly conduct.Among the residents facing charges are four buddies who met to drag race in a school parking lot, men who held weddings, a woman who left her home to toss a Molotov cocktail at her boyfriend’s residence -- unsuccessfully -- and a billiards hall owner who reopened after he was ordered to close. At least a dozen people have been charged with threatening to transmit the virus.Italy Reports Fewest New Cases in Two Weeks (12:30 p.m. NY)Italy reported the smallest number of new coronavirus cases in almost two weeks as the epicenter of Europe’s contagion enters its fourth week of lockdown.New infections in the past 24 hours totaled 4,050, compared with 5,217 the previous day, civil protection authorities said Monday at their daily news conference in Rome. This is the lowest increase since March 17.Fatalities rose by 812 on Monday compared with 756 on Sunday, bringing the total to 11,591. Italy now has 101,739 total cases, the most after the U.S.Read more hereEurope Expected to Start Stabilizing Soon, WHO Says (12:18 p.m. NY)European countries that took measures two to three weeks ago will probably begin to show some signs of stabilization soon, according to Mike Ryan, head of health emergencies at the World Health Organization. The WHO hopes Italy and Spain are nearly at the peak, though reducing the number of new cases requires proactive measures, Ryan said at a press briefing Monday.To know if they are testing enough, countries should be getting roughly 10 negative results for every confirmed infection, Ryan said. “If 80 or 90% of the people you test are positive, you are probably missing a lot of cases.”All Covid-19 patients should be taken to health facilities rather than staying at home, and their close contacts also ideally should be isolated outside the home, he said. Singapore’s success in containing the virus came by sending community workers door-to-door, checking people for symptoms such as fever, and immediately taking anyone suspected to be infected to a testing center, he said.EU Finance Ministers to Meet April 7 on Response (12:01 p.m. NY)Euro-area finance ministers will meet on April 7 to deliver proposals to reinforce the EU’s policy response to the coronavirus, Eurogroup President Mario Centeno said on Twitter.Their meeting comes after EU leaders last week struggled to find common ground on how best to cushion to the impact of the pandemic. Instead, they gave their finance chiefs two weeks to produce new proposals amid disagreements over whether they should deploy the bloc’s bailout fund or push with more ambitious plans such as joint debt in the form of so-called coronabonds.French Fashion Brands Ramp Up Mask Production (12:01 p.m. NY)The French fashion sector’s push to supply protective masks is on track to produce 480,000 units per day with 45 companies participating, Deputy Economy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said. Those masks, often reusable, will be intended as an additional protection measure for people working outside the medical sector.France’s makers of surgical masks are also ramping up production, targeting 40 million masks in April, Pannier-Runacher said Monday in a briefing to press.Lacoste, Yves Saint-Laurent and Chanel are among the French fashion makers that have said they’ll participate in the effort.CureVac to Start Trials This Summer, Focus Says (10:30 a.m. NY)The German biotech CureVac AG will start a trial of a potential coronavirus vaccine in early summer, the magazine Focus reported, citing an interview with CureVac supervisory board member Friedrich von Bohlen.

These efforts will help close loopholes in epidemic control work, according to a statement released on the website of the State Council, the top administrative body in China.Trump Says Hazard Pay for Hospitals Is Being Looked At (8:49 a.m. NY)The president told Fox News that hazard pay for hospital workers dealing with the coronavirus is being looked at.

The KfW declined to comment.Germany is in line with France in insisting firms forgo dividend payments.The Latest on Covid-19 Tests and Vaccines (7:30 a.m. NY)Johnson & Johnson rose in pre-market trading after saying it had selected a lead Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The company expects to initiate human clinical studies latest by September and anticipates the first batches of a vaccine could be available for emergency use authorization in early 2021.Earlier, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he expects data about remdesivir “in month or so” that will indicate whether the drug works for coronavirus and whether it’s safe to use.Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories shares rose 18% in U.S. pre-market trading after the company introduced a coronavirus test that can tell if someone is infected in as little as five minutes, and is so small and portable it can be used in almost any health-care setting.And Israel has developed a 3D-printed sticker to attach to a standard surgical mask to increase its protective capabilities.

2020-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Kyash Inc., a Tokyo-based digital banking startup, has raised $45 million from investors at a time the coronavirus outbreak threatens to dry up venture capital funding.The Series C round was co-led by Greenspring Associates Inc. and Goodwater Capital, bringing the total raised by the company to date to $73 million, Kyash Chief Executive Officer Shinichi Takatori said in an interview. Kyash, which also counts Jafco Co. and Japanese banks Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. among its investors, will use the funds to expand its digital banking offerings.Kyash has developed a payment platform that links directly to Visa Inc.’s system, allowing it to issue cards to consumers as well as tailor services to businesses. The company is part of the growing universe of so-called challenger banks, a group of mostly online operators that aim to use technology to reduce costs and lure customers away from established competitors. The cohort includes Monzo, Starling Bank and Revolut Ltd. in Europe and Chime in the U.S. SoftBank Group Corp.’s Vision Fund last year invested $800 million into financing company Greensill.“It is a vote of confidence in our business, especially at a time like this,” Takatori said. “Our investors believe we can be the leading challenger bank in Japan.”The 34-year-old CEO founded the company five years ago after stints in banking and consulting. Kyash launched a peer-to-peer money transfer app in 2017 and added a Visa-linked payment wallet a year later. It declined to disclose user numbers and other figures and only said its systems currently process about one transaction per second.In Japan, Kyash is up against heavy competition. Mercari Inc., whose mobile payment service counts more than 6 million users in the country, this year acquired pay service Origami Inc., while e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. runs its own bank, has a credit card with more than 19 million customers and is launching a mobile network. SoftBank is in the process of creating a domestic giant by combining its Yahoo Japan internet business with Line Corp., whose app is used by about half of Japan’s population to send instant messages every day. Both companies compete in mobile payments.While Takatori acknowledges that not having a large, existing user base is a challenge, he says his company enjoys a light cost structure because it was built from scratch. The app also reflects transactions in real time, without delays typical of cards that involve processing by third parties.“Unlike some of our competitors, we are not doing this to funnel people into some other service or try to sell them a mobile plan,” Takatori said. “This is our main business.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Japanese Fintech Startup Raises Funds Despite Virus Chilling VCs

2020-04-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Cash is dirty. Credit cards may be even dirtier. That’s a problem in this new germophobic world created by the coronavirus. There will likely be new winners and losers as consumers shift to products and services that help them keep their social distance even after this outbreak subsides. Is it finally time to embrace the digital wallet?Take Apple Inc.’s Apple Pay, a service that stores your credit-card information and lets you pay for purchases via your iPhone. The tech giant launched the product six years ago, but it didn’t bring about the revolution it hoped it would, where mobile payments lead the move toward a cashless society as it had in China. Here in the U.S., there just wasn’t a compelling enough reason for many consumers to change their entrenched routines. Now, though, Apple Pay’s ability to let customers shop inside physical stores and pay for things without having to make physical contact with a counter or card-reader may be the catalyst it needs to finally disrupt the payments industry.My own habits are noticeably changing on this front. Though I had my card information inside Apple Pay for years, I rarely ever used it. Old habits die hard, and I simply didn’t mind pulling out my credit card and paying for things the usual way. Nowadays? Not so much. Due to virus fears, I would rather not tap on a payment terminal’s numeric key pads or use my finger to sign for purchases when there is a much cleaner alternative. As a result, Apple Pay has now become the main way I pay for things whenever I venture outside.The way Apple Pay works is, you type in your credit card information into the Apple Wallet app. Once entered, you can pay for items at most physical store retailers by double-clicking the power button, authenticating using Face ID or Touch ID and then hovering your iPhone a few inches above the payment terminal. Google Pay and Samsung Pay work similarly on their respective smartphones. This type of proximity-based mobile payment enables consumers to pay for items without touching or handing over anything.  Traditional paper bills and physical card payment alternatives are filthy in comparison. An academic study cited by Mastercard found the average cash note has 26,000 bacterial colonies. And according to LendEDU, a personal finance products comparison website, credit cards contain even more germs than cash or New York City subway poles. It makes sense as cards are often put on tables, inside restaurant bill folders and are rarely cleaned, while cash is constantly circulated by hand.Yes, the credit-card companies are rolling out their own version of contactless or “tap-to-pay” payments. Visa and Mastercard both said in their most recent reported quarters that about one-third of global transactions are now contactless. But the usage rate of the new cards is much lower in the U.S. as many Americans have yet to receive them. Further, it still requires touching the physical card and tapping the terminal (or at least getting the card within a couple of inches). This year, Apple Pay will command 47% of the U.S. proximity-based mobile payment market, with Google capturing 19% and Samsung Pay 17%, according to an eMarketer forecast.Admittedly, the U.S. market is still small, and expectations were relatively muted heading into this year before the pandemic struck. Only about 33 million Americans were expected to use Apple Pay’s proximity-based payment feature in 2020, or 14.5% of smartphone users, according to an eMarketer forecast made in September. But things are a lot different now.If Apple Pay and its brethren do take off, there will be deeper ramifications across the industry. Credit-card companies will do fine because their card networks are still being utilized by the smartphone maker’s service. But it could be a negative for PayPal Holdings Inc., the payments company that dominates the adjacent market of digital checkout buttons for online retailers.PayPal’s e-commerce checkout button enables its users to pay for online orders on retailer websites without having to re-type address or payment information, reducing friction to complete orders. It is a critical cash cow for the company and accounts for nearly 90% of its earnings, according to MoffettNathanson.But Apple Pay also offers a competing digital checkout feature. And if Apple Pay became increasingly used inside physical stores, it seems likely customers will be inclined to use the service for e-commerce transactions as well, eating into PayPal’s business.With new consumer habits being formed in a coronavirus world, Apple’s gain may be PayPal’s pain.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-04-09,"(Bloomberg) -- The mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is getting a boost from credit card giant Visa Inc., which joined startup Fold to offer a card that earns rewards denominated in the cryptocurrency instead of airline miles or cash.As much as 10% of cash purchases made with the co-branded debit card from San Francisco-based Fold and Visa will be credited to users in Bitcoin, Fold Chief Executive Officer Will Reeves said. He expects it can bring a wave of consumers to the world’s most-valuable digital asset.“People are not interested in spending Bitcoin right now, but are interested in accumulating it,” Reeves said in an interview. “If people don’t understand Bitcoin as money yet, they certainly will understand it as a better reward.”Visa’s approach to crypto has been evolving. Just two years ago it was in a public fight with the Coinbase Inc. exchange over issues related to purchases made using its cards. Then, in February, Coinbase and Visa announced the Coinbase Card, which allows users to spend Bitcoin using the Visa debit card.The Fold partnership was announced Thursday in a statement from the companies, and Reeves said cards are expected to be issued in July. He declined to name the banks that are backing the card.Bitcoin is a challenging technology for retail users, who must establish an account on an exchange and set up a virtual “wallet” to help protect from hackers. Reeves said his firm is working to make the process simpler. Fold users also have the option to spend Bitcoin within the company’s system to buy U.S. dollar-denominated gift cards at companies including Starbucks Inc. or Uber, he said.Placing Bitcoin rewards next to familiar incentives like airline miles, loyalty points or cash shows a maturity in how people are viewing cryptocurrencies, Reeves said.Bitcoin “enters the pantheon where it’s that much closer to everyday consumers,” he said. “I fundamentally believe there are more shoppers than speculators.”Visa said the Fold partnership is part of its Fast Track program, which encourages fintechs to work with the card giant.(Updates with Fast Track in final paragraph.

2020-04-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. and its partners said their Libra cryptocurrency project will now support multiple versions of the digital coins, the majority of which will be backed by individual fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, as part of changes made to appease skeptical regulators worldwide.The Libra Association, the governing body overseeing the proposed project, redesigned the currency and made other changes responding to financial regulators concerned the effort could undermine the power and control of central banks. The group said Thursday it plans to support multiple Libra stablecoins, with each working like a digital version of a country’s existing currency.The organization has also begun talks with Swiss regulators for a payments license, and hopes to register with FinCEN, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as a “money services business,” according to Dante Disparte, head of policy for the Libra Association. “We’re working toward a late 2020 readiness timeline” to launch the Libra network, Disparte added.When Facebook unveiled Libra 10 months ago, it intended to create a single global currency that would be pegged to a basket that included fiat currencies, like the U.S. dollar and euro, and securities like treasuries. That plan faced criticism from politicians and regulators worried that Libra could usurp some power from central banks, who use money creation as a tool to influence and protect markets, or be used for black-market purposes, like money laundering.After months of discussions, the Libra Association has backpedaled on those initial plans, though it still hopes to create a version of the Libra currency made up of “a digital composite of some of the single-currency stablecoins,” the organization wrote in a white paper published Thursday. Bloomberg previously reported on the association’s plans to offer multiple versions of the Libra currency. Facebook has said it won’t launch Libra without regulatory approval, but it’s unclear whether the changes will appease critics and financial officials.“Which currency will be adopted and used will vary by use cases,” said Christian Catalini, head economist for Facebook’s Calibra division, which created the project. He suggested that when sending money across borders, the multicurrency Libra could be a better option, whereas the single-currency stablecoins would make more sense for everyday purchases in a consumer’s home country.The restructuring could help Libra with regulation. The original plan led some to characterize Libra as a security, a designation that brings much greater regulatory oversight. Some central banks also worried that a popular coin backed by a basket of currencies would undermine their ability to manage fluctuations of their home currency, a concern the Libra Association acknowledged in its white paper.The changes could also potentially clear the way for more companies to join the association as members, perhaps lowering the risk of backlash from regulators. Many of the original high-profile participants left the organization before it signed a charter, including Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. Disparte said that adding banks as partners on the project is a “massive priority.” The association will need banks, for example, to help manage the reserve funds for the Libra currency. “We’re not a banking institution and we don’t aim to be,” he said.Included in the association’s update was a change in plans for its Libra blockchain. Last year, the group said it planned to eventually let anybody participate in running its network -- not just members -- the way anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network. Now Libra is backpedaling to say that anyone who wants to verify transactions on the network will need to gain certain approvals. The exact approvals process is still being worked out.The Libra association, which was officially formed in October, is still taking shape, Disparte said. The group has added two new members since concluding its charter, including Shopify Inc., which provides e-commerce tools, and now has 22 in total. It also hopes to hire a chief executive officer by the end of the second quarter.Member companies have contributed financially to pay for the association’s operations, Disparte said, adding that Facebook, the largest member and the project’s founder, is providing less than 10% of this money. Still, that means it’s likely paying more than some of the association’s other 21 members. An association spokesperson declined to explain why.(Includes association’s plan to add banking partners in the eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook-Backed Libra Plans Multiple Single-Currency Coins

Bungling BoeingUsually, Boeing's well-documented struggles are of its own doing, but today the stock tumbled because United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) outgoing CEO Oscar Munoz was rather chatty and none of what he had to say was pleasant.Munoz noted that while the company, a major Boeing customer, is getting federal assistance under the CARES Act, it won't be enough to cover fixed and operating costs. He added the carrier is going to scrap 90% of its flights next month and that layoffs are a possibility, a reversal from a previous stance. Late to the PartySometimes, it's better to be late than to never arrive at all and that may explain why Verizon (NYSE:VZ) gained more than 1% today on news that it's buying video conference service provider BlueJeans Network.Due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, video conferencing is all the rage these days as more Americans work from home. Terms of the deal weren't revealed, but investors apparently like the idea, as Verizon was one of the better Dow performers today. Intel Perks UpIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) was in the Dow winners circle today after chip contract maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) reported better-than-expected earnings. For those familiar with the concept of a &quot;bellwether stock,&quot; Taiwan Semi is one of the bellwethers in the chip space. Guilt by AssociationMastercard (NYSE:MA), not a Dow stock, was stung Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell downgrading the stock today, citing weak travel spending that could weigh on the stock into next year.That ominous summation isn't limited to Mastercard. It's highly relevant to Dow members American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa's (NYSE:V), which explains why those stocks followed peer Mastercard lower on Thursday. Walmart WinningWalmart (NYSE:WMT) continues winning as a coronavirus play, ascending to another 52-week high today while extending its gain over the past week to 8.55%. What's interesting about the strength in Walmart is that comes against the backdrop of weak retail sales and easing COVID-19 cases, but of which are risks to this name, but it appears the stock is rebuffing those concerns. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayToday is significant for another reason because at 6 p.m. EST, President Trump will reveal federal guidelines for reopening the economy. It's not unreasonable to expect that with this announcement coming today, the president will point to May 1 as the restart day.Even if it's May 15, things are about to get interesting, politically speaking, because a cadre of Democratic governors from coast to coast appear intent on delaying their states' reopenings.Assuming some states get back to business before others and those in the latter group continue struggling economically, governors can attempt to shift blame to the White House all they want, but that's their own risky gambit, one Trump will remind voters of on the campaign trail.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently trading down from its 52 week high by 24.15%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Visa has a better P/E ratio of 30.28 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 9.77 of the credit services industry.

2020-04-17,"Since November 2013, the New York Stock Exchange has been run out of Atlanta.Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), founded to run futures markets in 1999, spent $11 billion on NYSE Euronext in 2013, then spun off the European markets the next year. The IPO was worth $1.2 billion.Since then, ICE has been the worst-performing stock market stock. While ICE's value has doubled, Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is up 169%. Euronext (OTCMKTS:EUXTF), the ICE spinoff, has been the star of the show, up a whopping 269%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut if you're thinking of getting into this relative bargain, there's more trouble ahead. Because the man who brought the exchange to Atlanta, Jeff Sprecher, has also bought himself huge political risk. That risk might yet force ICE to divest its prize asset. What Sprecher WroughtIt's fitting that Atlanta now owns the NYSE. Atlanta is the primary back office of the credit card processing industry. Running a stock exchange today is a lot like processing credit card transactions.  * 9 Asian Stocks to Buy for a Post-Coronavirus Recovery Sprecher understood this from the beginning. The low cost of processing real-time transactions, once the software is running, is behind the growth of ICE. When the exchange was forced to close its &quot;trading floor&quot; early this year because of the novel coronavirus, nothing happened. The floor had become nothing more than a TV stage set years before. Everyone can do fine without it.But that change, which all other exchanges have since copied, was Sprecher's one weird trick. ICE has nothing more up its sleeve.ICE stock opened for trade April 17 at about $90 per share, a market capitalization of near $49 billion. It's by far the largest company in the field, with Nasdaq having a market cap of just $17 billion. But it's an underperforming asset, not worth an investor's money. It has a price-earnings ratio of nearly 25, against nearly 30 for Visa (NYSE:V). The dividend, just 30 cents per share, yields a paltry 1.4%.Then there's that political trouble. Icarus in CongressOn Jan. 24 the Senate Health Committee got a private briefing on the coming pandemic. Over the next few weeks, while President Donald Trump's administration downplayed the threat, its newest member and her husband posted 29 stock transactions, almost all of them sell orders. Among the few buys was Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), whose software helps people work at home.The junior member was Kelly Loeffler, a Republican of Georgia. She's Jeff Sprecher's wife. Loeffler denies she did anything wrong, but in April the couple moved their holdings to exchange-traded funds (ETFs). A recent poll has her being pounded by her Republican primary opponent, Rep. Doug Collins.It gets worse. Among the stocks Sprecher sold, after the briefing, was ICE stock itself. Before the virus impact hit the couple sold $19 million worth of ICE shares, at prices from $89-$92. On March 23 ICE closed under $67.So far the only legal result has been a caution by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But if Republicans lose the November election, I expect that to change. The Bottom Line on ICE StockA Democratic president and Congress could easily decide to make an example of Jeff Sprecher and ICE. A demand that ICE divest itself of the exchange, or that Sprecher and Loeffler leave the company, is possible.Before becoming a senator, Loeffler was pushing Bakkt. This was originally a bitcoin futures market. Now it's being pushed as an app for moving seamlessly between &quot;fiat&quot; currencies and digital ones. The home page talks of things like buying coffee with bitcoin and getting gaming rewards.That's a long way to fall, from futures market to a coffee wallet. But it could be the future for Sprecher, and the best outcome for ICE shareholders.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

2020-04-17,"If people aren't spending money, then it's a lot harder for credit card companies like Visa (NYSE:V) to make a profit. And that's the conundrum facing V stock these days.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com The novel coronavirus' impact on the U.S. and global economy has been horrific, with the International Monetary Fund warning of the worst global downturn since the Great Depression. It calls it the &quot;Great Lockdown.&quot;President Donald Trump is eager to have states lift some restrictions as soon as possible. But health experts continue to caution that Americans should continue social distancing efforts so areas of the country that currently have reduced cases don't see a new flare-up.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAll this, of course, is difficult for payment processing companies that rely on a regular stream of credit card activity to churn a profit for investors.Visa is the dominant brand in the space, and despite the recent headwinds is still a quality stock for investors today. Here's a closer look at V stock. Taking a Glance at V StockVisa stock is down more than 11% so far in 2020, but that's an encouraging improvement from where we were just a month ago, when V was down more than 27%.It is outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down 17.6%, and competitor, Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which is down almost 14%.  * 7 Real Estate Stocks to Watch as the Long-Term Impact of the Virus Looms Two other competitors are faring much worse -- American Express (NYSE:AXP), is down 32.3% YTD, while Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) is down a whopping 61.1%.Earnings for V stock are expected on April 22. Analysts are expecting to see the beginnings of the economic slowdown impacting Visa's quarterly revenue and earnings-per-share growth. EPS is expected to be $1.36, versus $1.31 for the same quarter a year ago. Short-Term Prospects for VisaEarnings season began for major banks, and the early results are not good for V stock. Indications that banks are preparing for a huge increase in loan defaults, with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) setting aside $8.3 billion in the first quarter for loan losses -- that's $6.8 billion more than last year's first quarter.March retail sales numbers also raise a red flag. Economists had predicted a horrific 8% drop due to the coronavirus pandemic, but even that pessimistic forecast wasn't dire enough -- the final number was an 8.7% drop, which is the biggest fall in retail sales in 28 years.So it won't be surprising at all if Visa takes a beating in the next couple of weeks. Stimulus checks from the federal government started going out this week, but that money will be used for food staples, rent and mortgages, rather than any discretionary spending.Don't panic, though, because I'm confident things will get better for V stock. Long-Term Prospects for VisaFor investors who are looking to take a position in V stock while it's at a discount, there's plenty to appreciate.It's fundamentally sound. Visa is an exceptionally strong company that is able to weather a downturn. With a market cap of $367 billion and its profit margin is an extraordinary 52.6% -- a much better margin than Mastercard, American Express or Discover.It's innovative. Visa doesn't rest on its laurels -- it looks to expand into new opportunities. You can use a Visa card now to buy marijuana, or you can use your Visa rewards program to buy bitcoin.&quot;There's still so much room to grow in consumer payments. You'll see clearly today that there're still many consumers to reach, and there are still enormous opportunity to move consumers to electronic and digital payments,&quot; Visa CEO Al Kelly said at the company's annual investor day event.Visa is aggressive with fintech. Earlier this year, Visa announced it was purchasing the fintech company Plaid for $5.3 billion. Plaid lets its users share financial information and connect their bank accounts with apps and services such as Acorns, Betterment, Chime, Transferwise and Venmo. As roughly 75% of global internet-connected consumers use a fintech service to transfer money, it's incredibly smart for V to get in on that business.Visa offers a consistent dividend. The yield is nothing to write home about -- 0.7% for an annual payout of $1.20 per share. But don't ignore the fact that V stock offers a decent payout ratio of 21.9% with its dividend, or that the payout increased for 11 consecutive years. The Bottom Line for V StockVisa is a dominant player in the payment processing space and an essential company for how people spend and transfer their money.While the company is facing a difficult second quarter and bank earnings may weigh it down further, V stock can be had for a discount and it remains a solid choice for investors today.Visa has an 'A' quantitative grade in my Portfolio Grader tool, and gets a 'B' rating overall. And because it's also a good dividend stock, it gets a 'B' grade in my Dividend Grader as well.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-04-29,"Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) isn't a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but reports out today that the company's drug remdesivir is proving effective in treating the novel coronavirus were one reason why broader equity benchmarks surged.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 jumped 2.66%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 2.21%  * The Nasdaq Composite soared 3.57%  * Its first-quarter earnings report was bad (no surprise there) and  the company announced it would cut 10% of its workforce, but Boeing (NYSE:BA) was still the Dow's top performer today, surging 6.16%.The remdesivir news took precedence over headlines about first-quarter GDP, which contracted 4.8%. That's the worst shrinkage experienced by the world's largest economy since the dark days of the global financial crisis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn a related note, the Federal Reserve held interest rates near zero, with Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledging the current quarter will bring more weak economic data while saying the central bank &quot;will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.&quot;  * 9 Healthcare Stocks to Buy Even After the Coronavirus Fades Powell added that there are &quot;medium-term&quot; risks to the economy, but that didn't derail stocks' ascent today as 26 of 30 Dow components were higher in late trading. Sympathy PlaysBoosted by better-than-expected earnings from rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Dow members American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Visa (NYSE:V) were the next-best performers in the benchmark after Boeing.In the case of American Express, there's probably some likely some remdesivir ebullience behind today's rally. The sooner the coronavirus is put to bed, the sooner business and leisure -- two vital components of the Amex story -- can start rebounding.As for Visa, the Mastercard numbers are notable because the Dow member delivers its own earnings report Thursday after the close. Reopening…MaybeDisney (NYSE:DIS) is facing uncertainty regarding when Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California will reopen, but speculation that the former could open sometime over the next several weeks lifted the stock today.At this point in the coronavirus cycle for companies with heavy tourism exposure, something is better than nothing. But investors banking on more of the same news out of California helping Disney probably shouldn't. Golden State policymakers are under pressure to relax the current stay-at-home order, but it's hard to imagine the state reopening theme parks in the near-term. Apple WarningDon't worry, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) itself isn't issuing a warning in advance of its Thursday afternoon earnings report, but an analyst is telling investors to not expect a major 5G upgrade supercycle for the iPhone maker.&quot;We do not expect 5G to trigger a supercycle and believe the consensus revenue and EPS estimates for 2021 are too optimistic about the impact of 5G on iPhone sale,&quot; said LightShed Partners analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Gallone in a note out earlier today. Retreating From WalmartClosing lower by almost 3%, WalMart (NYSE:WMT) was by far the worst Dow offender today Gordon Haskett's Chuck Grom downgraded the stock, citing valuation concerns. Interestingly, the analyst raised his price target on the retail behemoth to $140 from $130. Go figure. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayNot to be lost in the remdesivir news is the fact that, as noted above, U.S. GDP slid 4.8% in the first three months of the year. That's one way, and an accurate one at that, of quantifying the impact of Covid-19, but long-term consequences may not be as dire as market participants previously believed.&quot;Current economic forecasts, including the most pessimistic, imply long-run economic consequences that are much less severe than the post-global financial crisis impact in both the U.S. and euro area,&quot; according to BlackRock.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly warned the firm will be challenged “for a number of quarters” even as declines in spending on its network began to moderate in April.As the U.S. government began sending out stimulus payments to millions of consumers this month, Visa saw an increase in spending on home improvement, automotive and some areas of health care. Still, spending on the firm’s cards in the U.S. has dropped 19% in April compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu.To offset the slowdown in spending on its cards, Visa said expenses in the second half of the year would be flat compared with the same period a year ago. The company, which has vowed it won’t make any virus-related layoffs this year, said costs rose 4% to $1.93 billion in the first three months of the year, below the $2.02 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.“We are pulling back on discretionary spending, especially related to personnel, travel, professional services and marketing,” Kelly said Thursday on a conference call with analysts after Visa announced fiscal second-quarter results.More than one-fifth of the U.S. spending on Visa’s network comes from food and drug stores, Walmart Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Target Corp. -- and that’s the only category to post an increase in April, climbing 20%. Spending on items like telecommunications, utilities, insurance and business supplies and equipment has been flat in April.Cross-border spending -- among the most lucrative transactions for Visa and its rival Mastercard Inc. -- fell 2% in the quarter ended March 31 as global travel ground to a halt. Still, declines in such spending moderated later, Visa said in a presentation on its website.“Although the road ahead will likely be challenging for a number of quarters, our business model is resilient,” Kelly said, adding that the firm renewed several partnerships in the period.Visa inked a new co-brand card deal with China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., which operates WeChat, the messaging app used by more than 1 billion people. The firm also renewed and expanded its partnership with Truist Financial Corp.Visa said net revenue in the quarter rose 7% to $5.85 billion, in line with analyst expectations.

2020-05-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of PayPal Holdings Inc. rallied as much as 13%, reaching a record high in early trading on Thursday, with analysts zeroing in on the payments company’s strong April trends and growth in electronic transactions across the board.Square Inc. rose as much as 8.6% to the highest since early March, as it benefited from some of that, too. But worries about credit and its small-and-medium sized business market factored in as well.Both are outperforming the market so far this year, with PayPal soaring 34% and Square up 19%, even as the S&P 500 has shed 11%, stung by the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.Here’s a sample of the latest commentary:Morgan Stanley, James FaucetteFor PayPal, “April really took off,” Faucette wrote in a note, “as consumers settled into modified behaviors.”Surging online activity and changes in behavior mean there’s a chance the firm can boost offline acceptance, which is key to maintaining its “pole position in the development of digital wallet services,” he said. That’s along with a big jump in new account activations, which quickened the pace of existing business growth.On the other hand, the downturn “makes Square look like a bank,” Faucette said, with loss reserves wiping out profit. Plus, there’s a looming “bank-like fall in loans to merchant borrowers,” while Cash App, which offers consumers bank-like services, had good results. He added that the Paycheck Protection Program gave Square Capital revenues “minor relief.”Faucette rates PayPal shares overweight and Square equal-weight.MoffettNathanson, Lisa EllisEllis flagged PayPal’s disclosure that May 1 was the company’s single largest volume day in its history, topping last Black Friday and Cyber Monday, while April core checkout button volumes rose more 43%, more than double pre-crisis growth rates.“In a sea of quite depressing payments results,” with Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. global card volumes trending down 20% to 25% through April, “God Bless the PayPal Checkout Button,” she said. “How goes the Checkout Button, goes PayPal.” She rates shares buy, with a target price of $170.Compass Point, Michael Del GrossoPayPal’s “April update was all that mattered and it didn’t disappoint,” Del Grosso wrote. Also, management commentary pointing to “durable” consumer shifts to online spending bolstered his view that the “current crisis only accelerated the longer-term, secular, consumer shift to e-commerce.”Del Gross sees PayPal as a “longer-term winner post-Covid.”However, Square’s expenses were materially higher than forecast due to a higher loan loss provision, and April’s worse-than-expected gross payment volume update signaled “material deceleration.” Plus, April’s Cash App new user growth may be “transitory once the effects of stimulus payments wane,” he added.He rates PayPal shares buy, with a target of $150; rates Square sell, with a target of $50.Guggenheim, Jeff Cantwell“Payment flows are shifting to e-commerce and digital as the world economy reorganizes in response to Covid-19,” Cantwell wrote, leaving PayPal “extremely well-positioned to grow TPV rapidly.”Bullish developments included adding a record number of net new active users in April at 7.4 million and record levels of customer engagement on the platform. Cantwell raised his PayPal price target to $152 from $123 and rates shares buy.KBW, Sanjay Sakhrani“We believe the payments industry is a beneficiary of the post Covid-19 changes society will implement, which will include a diminishing dependence on cash and check usage,” Sakhrani wrote. “Within that paradigm, PayPal should be a disproportionate beneficiary.” He rates shares outperform and lifted his price target to $152 from $120.(Updates first through third paragraphs for trading.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal Soars, Square Gains With Focus on Latest Trends"

2020-05-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After a prolonged shutdown, Ford Motor Co. officially resumed production at its North American factories this week. It hasn’t been as smooth a process as the company might have hoped: Ford had to temporarily close two critical facilities this week to allow for a deep cleaning after workers tested positive for the coronavirus. An Explorer SUV plant in Chicago was closed a second time after an employee at a nearby supplier facility tested positive for the virus, causing a parts shortage.This is the reality of manufacturing for the time being as companies fret about worker safety and the legal and reputational risks of not doing enough to protect employees. Unlike Ford, whose products fall into a category of consumer spending that’s become even more discretionary amid the pandemic, wide swaths of the industrial sector were deemed essential and allowed to remain operational. Those companies, too, have had their share of growing pains as they adjust to a new way of working.Boeing Co. temporarily closed its factories in the Puget Sound area in March after a worker died of the coronavirus and later briefly shuttered work at its 787 plant in South Carolina. CBS Minnesota reported earlier this month that a Honeywell International Inc. facility in Minneapolis had closed after a worker tested positive. Whirlpool Corp. closed its Amana, Iowa, refrigerator plant at least twice after employees tested positive for the virus, according to the Gazette local paper. Deere & Co. and Altria Group Inc.’s Philip Morris USA are among the many others that have had to close plants on a limited basis to avoid outbreaks among workers. Lockheed Martin Corp., meanwhile, said this week it will temporarily slow production of the F-35 fighter jet because of delays at suppliers.  It’s a lot harder, though, to bring factories back to life than it is to just figure it out as you go along. Ford may be a manufacturer, but because it’s one of the few to have experienced an extended lockdown, it’s arguably a better benchmark for the non-industrial economy. You better believe that office-based companies that have sent most of their workers home are keeping a close eye on how the likes of Ford fare in flipping the switch back on. Seeing the automaker’s setbacks this week, companies that can operate without their employees clustered in the same place may be less keen to rush back. They’re getting a more continuous stream of work out of their employees now than they would if they had to hit the pause button and clear out the office every few weeks. And the mixed messages from the White House aren't helpful: President Donald Trump is due to visit a Ford factory in Michigan that’s been converted to ventilator production and has been wishy-washy on whether he will adhere to the company’s face-mask requirements. Already, American Express Co. CEO Steve Squeri and Visa Inc. CEO Al Kelly said this week that most of their employees would work from home for the rest of the year. Some 28% of employers recently surveyed by Challenger, Gray & Christmas said they would make work-from-home arrangements permanent for at least some employees. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and social media site Twitter Inc. are among those who have publicly said remote working will be their indefinite default option. Facebook Inc. said Thursday it would follow suit and move to a more permanent remote workforce.At the end of the day, manufacturing or non-manufacturing, it's all interconnected. How permanent this shift to work from home will be is debatable, but if companies end up needing less office space, by default that means fewer HVAC systems, commercial lighting, fire and security products or even 3M Co.’s Post-it notes. And if workers aren’t going to be commuting, do they still need to buy cars from Ford? There's a lot riding on getting reopening right.     This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-05-22,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock has been a huge winner in 2020. The company has suffered only a modest negative impact from the novel coronavirus. And while the company has had to increase reserves for potential credit losses due to the virus, it's made up for that and more with a huge surge in payments activity. As a result, its shares are up an astounding 39% year-to-date. And for anyone that bought at the March lows, PayPal has soared 76% since the bottom.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com That said, the good news is that Paypal stock could have further to go still. That's because PayPal is one of the best-positioned companies out there for dealing with the current economic environment. With the virus still a lingering threat, who wants to be handling grimy physical cash right now? Many transactions have moved online, and PayPal is there to facilitate them.In the span of a few months, we've seen years worth of economic activity move into the digital realm -- and PayPal is right at the heart of the action. That said, it gets even better. PayPal is seeing demand soar even while the credit card companies are witnessing declining volumes for a reason we'll discuss in a moment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOverall, PayPal is in the sweet spot, and its shareholders are reaping the benefits. Leading The Contactless Retail RevolutionPayPal should be a huge beneficiary of post-coronavirus ""contactless"" retail practices. While contactless retail may seem like a simple phrase, it encompasses a ton of territory. You have traditional e-commerce, curbside pickup, cashier-less checkout in stores, in-app payments and more. The good news is that many of these options put PayPal on equal footing with the credit card networks. Therefore, plastic's traditional monopoly on digital payments is breaking down.  * 10 Stocks on a Bankruptcy Watch Contactless retail is hardly just a U.S. phenomenon either. In the United Kingdom -- for example -- thanks to the coronavirus, a major card company raised the limits on transaction sizes for many contactless payments. For British pound-based commerce, the limit increased from 30 pounds to 50 pounds per transaction. Following the increased limit, the average contactless transaction size has jumped nearly 50%, to 14 pounds each, and the contactless channel is earning tremendous market share, picking up nearly half of purchases within that price range.Of course, skeptics will say that this sort of uptake is happening primarily due to the crisis. And once it passes, people may return to their old ways. Some will, undoubtedly, but many won't. And once people become accustomed to the ease of contactless payments, many shoppers will stick with it forever -- thus increasing PayPal's share of the overall ecosystem. Astounding ResultsOverall, we can see this playing out in the company's most recent operating results. During April, PayPal gained 7.4 million new accounts and grew processed payments 18%. Given the sharp overall drop in economic activity, these are staggering figures. The total commerce pie shrank dramatically during April, yet PayPal managed to produce strong double-digit growth.This is in stark contrast to the major credit card companies. In fact, both Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) suffered 20% or greater declines in transaction activity over the same period.This shows another advantage to PayPal, as it tends to be favored by younger and more online customers who have rising earnings power as they get older. Visa and Mastercard are undoubtedly great brands. However, some of their most profitable business is tied to established business customers who will be reining in spending for the foreseeable future.Up until this crisis, Visa and Mastercard were widely viewed as the most powerful and entrenched payments companies out there. However, as PayPal gains market share, its valuation will continue to catch up with the credit card titans. Paypal Stock VerdictSimply put, PayPal is an innovative market force that will continue to lead. The company was already producing fantastic results before the current pandemic started, and what's going on with the health crisis will be an unbelievable shot of adrenaline for the war on cash. Therefore, as long as people are being careful, PayPal will take more market share -- not only from cash, but also from credit cards.Yes, Paypal stock is rich. It is trading at 46 times forward earnings, and nearly 10 times revenues. Both of those are way up there, but it is deserving of its premium price. The company has grown its earnings at more than 30% a year compounded over the past five years, and analysts see 20% earnings per share (EPS) growth going forward. These are tremendous numbers in any environment, and especially so with the coronavirus-induced recession causing slowdowns for so many other leading companies.Even the credit card companies have been showing signs of weakness thanks to the economic situation. Yet, Visa and Mastercard routinely trade for more than 30x earnings, and were trading for as much as 20x sales prior to the March market crash.Collectively, PayPal doesn't look bad at all by comparison, so don't let its valuation scare you too much. The company's fundamentals fully support a bullish outlook right now.Eric Fry is an award-winning stock picker with numerous ""10-bagger"" calls -- in good markets AND bad. How?

2020-05-22,"The coronavirus crisis has effectively reset the board. While both the economy and stock market will someday return to their earlier-year strength, neither will look the same. That means some of the best stocks to buy right now might look much different from top picks just a few quick months ago.The market might very well have another leg down. It's far too early to say we're out of the woods given that most of America is under quarantine and we have yet to see what first-quarter earnings and second-quarter guidance looks like. But we're getting late in the game for a truly defensive posture. That's closing the barn door after the horse has already bolted. While a few protective picks might be in order, now is the time to start planning for the next bull market.Even professional bears are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.""I'm selectively buying in my personal accounts,"" says John Del Vecchio, co-manager of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (HDGE). ""There were plenty of companies that went into this crisis on life support, kept alive by cheap debt. You're going to see a lot of these companies fail. But at the same time, a lot of high-quality blue chips are on sale right now at prices we may never see again in our lifetimes.""Many companies will be gutted. It might take years for airlines to return to pre-crisis passenger numbers, and they might go through bankruptcy or a government conservatorship in the meantime. Likewise, retailers and restaurants might be dealing with the fallout from lockdowns for months or years, as will their banks and landlords.However, some of Wall Street's best stocks could come out of this with relatively minor scratches. Many have massive stores of cash that will help them weather short-term profit drops. Some might actually benefit from a coming recession by picking up market share when its competitors fold.  Many of these beneficiaries are tech stocks, but certainly not all. Plenty are in the gritty, old-fashioned real economy.Today, we'll look at 20 of the best stocks to buy now as investors shift their focus to the recovery.

2020-05-26,"Visa Inc (NYSE: V) shares are up 16% in the past month, but at least one larger option trader is betting on more upside from the credit card giant as the US economy begins to open back up.The TradeOn Tuesday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received an option alert related to an unusually large Visa trade.  * At 11:56 a.m., a trader bought 12,000 Visa call options with a $220 strike price expiring on Sep. 18 at the ask price of $2.84. The trade represented a more than $3.4 million bullish bet.Why It's ImportantEven traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of Tuesday's Visa option trade it could certainly be institutional hedging.Visa's Uncertain OutlookThere doesn't seem to be any company-specific news that could have triggered the large buy on Tuesday, suggesting the buyer may simply see Visa as a major beneficiary of an overall recovery in the economy in the coming months.Wall Street has been quiet on Visa since last Wednesday when Cowen reiterated its Outperform rating and $196 price target for Visa. Earlier this month, Visa withdrew its full-year guidance but reported a 4% increase in fiscal second-quarter profits.Bullish sentiment among StockTwits messages mentioning Visa was at 93.4% on Tuesday, up from its 2020 low of 56.6% on April 3.

2020-05-29,"I recently published my top recommendations of the best stocks to buy for a post-coronavirus bump. There are huge opportunities for strong profits as the economy rebounds, so this is a great time for investors. But one of those names, Square (NYSE:SQ) stock, deserves a closer look.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Let's do that now.I'm already on the record as saying I think SQ is the ideal stock to buy for the 21st century economy. Mom-and-pop businesses, food trucks, Girl Scout cookie sales. They all can easily process credit card payments by using Square's dongles attached to a mobile device.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd now that we live in a world touched by the novel coronavirus, people are going to be much less willing to handle cash. In turn, they will be more inclined to make payments with their Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), American Express (NYSE:AXP) or Discover (NYSE:DFS) cards.Even payment options from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) will likely see more traffic as people decide transferring money from person to person isn't the most hygienic thing in the world. SQ Stock at a GlanceSquare is trading close to $80 right now and is up nearly 30% year to date. But that doesn't represent the absolute whipsaw that SQ put investors through so far this year.The stock price fell more than 55% in March as the pandemic shuttered many businesses across the country. And it disproportionally hurt SQ, as a huge percentage of Square's revenue comes from small businesses that make less than $125,000 annually.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure The rally really caught fire earlier this month when Square issued its first-quarter earnings, in which the company reported revenue of $1.4 billion that beat Wall Street's estimates of $1.3 billion.Square's Cash App saw its revenue jump nearly 200% to $528 million. The app is becoming more important for users because it offers access to CARES Act stimulus payments approved by Congress.However, Square reported a net loss for the quarter of $106 million as it increased its reserves in preparation for likely loan losses. The company issued a stark warning to investors that, while it should come as no surprise, seems to have scared some analysts off:""We recognize that the macroeconomic environment is having a significant impact on people around the world, including many of our customers. This may cause a variety of outcomes for our financial results in upcoming quarters, depending on the length and severity of the impact from COVID-19, and we expect a material impact to our second-quarter results."" The Bears Are Coming OutSquare has been rallying nicely, but bearish sentiment is emerging. Frankly, the origin of that sentiment is off the mark.Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg recently downgraded SQ stock from ""buy"" to ""underperform,"" while expressing doubt that small businesses will be able to bounce back once their government stimulus checks run out.UBS analyst Eric Wasserstrom also issued a downgrade, from ""neutral"" to ""sell,"" while raising his price target from $54 to $63. He cited what he called a ""weak outlook"" for Square's seller business.Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell also issued a downgrade. He said Square will be hurt by small and mid-sized business that he expects will struggle through 2021.With all due respect, the bearish commentary on SQ stock is short-sighted right now.The company is building amazing depth. Square also has Square Register, Square Payroll and Square Capital. These solutions give it the resources to handle both personal and business finance.The company also received approval in March to open its own bank, which opens the door for it to offer personal and business banking services.Cash App also features the Cash Card, which works like a debit card and lets customers buy and sell bitcoin and invest in stocks. Square said its revenue off of bitcoin transactions was $306 million last quarter, compared to $65.5 million in 2019.In addition, Square Cash allows people to transfer money to each other with their mobile devices, making it a legitimate competitor to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and  its Venmo app.At the end of 2019, Square Cash had 24 million active users, compared to 52 million for Venmo. The Bottom Line on SquareEven if smaller businesses struggle in the aftermath of the pandemic, Square is an ideal stock to own. It makes perfect sense for today's economy.SQ stock maintains its buy rating in my Portfolio Grader, where it continues to have a B grade.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-05-29,"Few companies typify the long-term mindset that accompanies consistent stock market winners better than Visa (NYSE:V). Its focus, addressable market and day-in-day-out ability to execute make V stock one of my favorite blue-chip stock picks.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com Founded in 1958, Visa has grown to become one of the Big Three names in the credit card industry along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).Today, it's a $400 billion behemoth -- and even in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic this year, the company is holding its own, and the stock is reaping the rewards.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHere's a look at some of what makes V stock such an attractive pick moving forward: Visa Is Robust and Betting on ItselfIt's almost always good when you see established, blue-chip companies like Visa betting heavily on themselves. That has been the story of 2020 thus far for the credit card giant, beginning the year with the acquisition of the hot fintech startup Plaid for $4.9 billion in cash.  * 7 Red-Hot Vaccine Stocks Racing to Develop a Coronavirus Cure Visa may have been born in the '50s, but you don't earn a value of $400 billion by 2020 if you're not willing to adapt with the times, and the acquisition of Plaid, which helps other fintech firms connect with their customers' bank accounts, is a perfect example of Visa's savvy.Firstly, the move will further entrench Visa in digital payments; it's already the largest credit card network in the U.S., handling $2.1 trillion in transactions last quarter alone. To stay as relevant as it is today, Visa needs to embrace the fintech space and the world of e-commerce. It continued doing just that in the Plaid acquisition.Second, buying Plaid with cash -- instead of, say, a deal financed entirely with V stock -- shows just how much executives believe in the company longer term. The company was saying: ""No, we don't believe our stock is overvalued, and we're willing to put our money where our mouth is.""That sentiment was followed up last quarter as the company bought back $3.2 billion in V stock. Not only that, it reiterated its intentions to buy back $9 billion in Visa shares on the year -- one of the most uncertain years in our lifetimes. Good Earnings, Better Trends for V StockIt's no wonder Visa is beating the market this year. It even managed to boost both revenue and earnings in the difficult March quarter, seeing revenue jump 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share increase 9%.Going forward, an increasingly cashless economy will continue to be a long-term tailwind for Visa, and rollouts of contactless card technology will make the company increasingly relevant for in-store purchases as well.Visa's stock is also well-positioned for the unstoppable shift to e-commerce that has been ongoing for years now, and which has been accelerated by the pandemic. Nobody's using cash when shopping on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and that's good for payment processors like Visa, which saw e-commerce volumes rise 18% in April.Visa is one of the rare names that investors can buy and hold for 10 years without sweating whether the company will exist or still be a player. V stock, which has outperformed the market in a very tough year for investors, looks poised to do so for years to come.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.

2020-06-12,"(Bloomberg) -- The White House has developed proposals severely limiting employment-based immigration visas as the nation recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, though President Donald Trump has yet to decide whether to push forward changes that may effectively halt the entry of foreign workers until autumn.One possibility under consideration would restrict people from entering the U.S. on several different visa categories, including the H1-B program for high-skilled workers, for as long as 180 days, according to two people familiar with the proposal. They asked not to be identified discussing internal government deliberations.Workers who were granted those visas but remain outside the country may not be able to enter until the order expires. The move would affect hundreds of companies and thousands of people; the H1-B is awarded to about 85,000 workers annually.But the president, who is spending a long weekend at his Bedminister golf resort in New Jersey, has not yet made a final decision about how to proceed, and the administration is weighing different possibilities as well.“The administration is currently evaluating a wide range of options, formulated by career experts, to protect American workers and job seekers, especially disadvantaged and under-served citizens -- but no decisions of any kind have been made,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement.The possible H-1B restrictions were reported Thursday by the Wall Street Journal. The president is also considering new regulations that would raise standards for migrants hoping to obtain asylum and a rule that would allow immigration judges to deny those requests without giving migrants the chance to testify in court, the New York Times reported Friday.The various proposals come as the president looks to bolster his “America First” credentials ahead of November’s election. He has seen his approval ratings lag amid the health and economic destruction wreaked by the outbreak, which so far has killed at least 114,000 Americans. An executive order Trump signed in April that halted the issuance of new green cards for would-be U.S. permanent residents called for the government to evaluate whether the restrictions should be extended or modified within 50 days -- or June 12. Trump at the time suggested he could extend the immigration ban to help protect jobs for American citizens as the country recovered from the coronavirus pandemic.“We want to take care of our citizens first,” Trump said. “We have to. And it’s a very powerful order. It’s for 60 days. At the end of 60 days, or maybe even during 60 days, I’ll extend it or not.”Restrictions could also impact the J-1 visa for short-term workers including camp counselors and au pairs and the L-1 visa for workers transferring within their companies. Workers who already hold the visas but are outside the country could be barred from reentry, immigration lawyer Greg Siskind said Thursday.“If you can get back, I’d cut your trip short and come back immediately,” Siskind tweeted.The executive action could impact workers for as long as 180 days and also impact short-term seasonal workers, Atlanta-area immigration firm Kuck Baxter warned clients in a memo earlier this week. The firm said the suspension could be for as long as 180 days and would likely include exceptions for health care and food supply workers.Trump’s original executive order was hastily drafted after he tweeted at the height of the coronavirus pandemic that he planned to “temporarily suspend immigration into the United States.”His tweet caught businesses, farmers, and even some White House aides by surprise, and came before lawyers on the president’s team had finished drafting the executive order. Critics of the administration said that the move would make it harder for families impacted by the coronavirus to reunite and disrupt attempts by businesses to employ critical workers.But some Republican senators -- including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Chuck Grassley of Iowa -- have urged Trump to suspend guest-worker visas for at least a year.“Given the extreme lack of available jobs for American job-seekers as portions of our economy begin to reopen, it defies common sense to admit additional foreign guest workers to compete for such limited employment,” the Republicans wrote in a letter to the White House last month.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Immigration Order May Halt Work Visa Entries Until Fall

2020-06-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp messenger launched a payments feature in Brazil, the app’s second-biggest market with more than 120 million users.Payments on WhatsApp will be free for users, whether sending to friends on the app or to pay a business for goods and services. The Facebook unit will charge business owners a fee for purchases and is partnering with Cielo SA, Brazil’s largest payments company, to process transactions.WhatsApp has tested payments in a handful of markets over the past two years, including India and Mexico, but Brazil is the first where the service will go through a full-scale rollout of the feature. Facebook started a small test of the product in Brazil about a month ago, WhatsApp Chief Operating Officer Matt Idema said in an interview, adding that the country is among the leaders when it comes to people using WhatsApp to interact with merchants.Payments are a key element of WhatsApp’s long-term plan to offer commerce within the app -- and Facebook has been testing and building its payments product for the past two years. More than 5 million merchants around the world use a business version of the messenger app, and in countries like India and Brazil, WhatsApp serves as the main or only online presence for many mom-and-pop retailers.WhatsApp wants to be the primary way these small businesses interact with their customers -- a new version of email or a 1-800 number -- and also serve as a storefront for users to buy products, Idema said.Progress to date hasn’t been entirely smooth. In India, WhatsApp’s largest and most important market, regulators have pushed back against Facebook’s payments plan.Read more: WhatsApp Gets a Raw Deal in Payments: Andy MukherjeeStill, WhatsApp has started to push its commerce plans more aggressively after years of questions about its eventual business strategy. In April, Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Reliance Jio, the owner of some of India’s most popular digital services, including a commerce platform called JioMart. In early June, Facebook also revealed it had invested in Gojek, the largest startup in Indonesia, which has evolved from a ride-hailing service to a suite of digital services that includes payments.Facebook’s investments have been geared toward helping WhatsApp better integrate into national economies and give the company more access to local merchants who might want to use the service.Read more: Facebook Seals Biggest Deal Since WhatsApp With AmbaniWhatsApp is relying on what Idema calls an “open partner” model for payments, too. “We want it to be possible for any person to send money to anyone or pay any business inside the app,” he said. “If that’s your vision, then to achieve it you have to have an open partner approach.”Becoming a Facebook partner can be lucrative, at least in the short term. Cielo stock on Monday jumped about 35% after news of the WhatsApp arrangement. Rival payments companies StoneCo Ltd. and PagSeguro Digital Ltd. fell as much as 8.5% and 10%, respectively.In Brazil, that approach means partnering with three banks: Banco do Brasil, Nubank and Sicredi. WhatsApp users who have accounts with any one of those banks will be able to add their Visa Inc. or Mastercard Inc. debit or credit card to Facebook’s payments system for use on the app. Facebook will charge merchants a 3.99% processing fee for accepting payments on WhatsApp.Eventually, this system will also work across Facebook’s apps, Idema said.Users who sign up for payments on WhatsApp will do so through the company’s Facebook Pay feature, which is also rolling out on Messenger and Instagram. Once Facebook makes it possible for users to send messages between all its services -- a long-term project the company announced last year -- they’ll also be able to send money between apps as well.Payments on WhatsApp will be available to those in Brazil in the coming weeks and will expand to other countries soon, said Idema.(Updates with stock prices in the 10th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Rolling Out WhatsApp Payments in Brazil

2020-06-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- After years of trying, American Express Co. is finally cracking into the China market. Now the hard work begins.On Saturday, AmEx got the green light to start processing yuan payments, making it the first of the big three U.S. card companies to get access to the mainland. The license, initially approved in 2018, gives AmEx a portal to some of the world’s biggest spenders, and will pit the company against state-backed China UnionPay Co., which dominates the market. Currently, holders of AmEx, MasterCard Inc. and Visa Inc. cards can only use them for foreign-currency payments outside China or on overseas websites.  Competition will come not just from UnionPay cards, which dominate the market, but also mobile-payment apps, where Ant Financial’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay are big players. AmEx’s partner, LianLian, is tiny by comparison. To top it off, China is also testing out the digital yuan, another budding rival in the payment space. “Having a foreign branded card in your wallet used to mean you have made it in China, but now matters little,” says Zennon Kapron, the founder of a fintech consulting firm.Another challenge is that fees in China are lower than in the U.S., so companies need to win scale to make the big bucks: The card-clearing fee rate is 0.065% for domestic banks and the acquiring fee rate ranges from 0.5% to 1%. In the U.S., issuers like AmEx charge between 1.4% and 3.5%. AmEx and its Chinese partner will also have to convince local banks to issue cards processed on their network, and get more merchants to accept them. Because of the high fees it charges compared with rivals, AmEx tends to be used less in Asia and Europe. Still, there is money to be made if AmEx plays its cards right. One strategy that’s worked in the U.S. is offering plenty of rewards. A large card firm told Kapron, the consultant, that even with the thinnest slice of the market, it would still be profitable. There will always be spenders who like premium cards they can use at home and overseas, he says.Banks, too, could benefit from choice beyond UnionPay, notes James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific fintech leader at Ernst & Young LLP in Hong Kong. More competition can only be a good thing for their merchant clients and cardholders.To AmEx’s credit, just getting to this point is a step in the right direction. It’s been a long slog.(2) Both Visa and MasterCard have been waiting since 2006 to gain access to China.  AmEx cleared a key hurdle in early January when regulators accepted its application to start a bank-card clearing business with LianLian. Last March, MasterCard refiled its application, raising its stake in a joint venture with NetsUnion Clearing Corp., or Wanglian, a clearing house for online payments. There’s little clarity on the progress of Visa’s application, which was made in July 2018 without a mainland partner. Of course, there is a whiff of politics in the timing of all this. As tensions between Washington and Beijing intensify amid the coronavirus outbreak, China appears to be holding up its end of the phase one trade deal. The preliminary agreement signed in January included measures to speed up the opening of mainland financial markets, with plans to accelerate approvals for AmEx, MasterCard and Visa, specifically. By starting with AmEx, Beijing is picking off the low-hanging fruit; its mainland partner stands to benefit from any increased business, too.But with Covid-19 wreaking havoc on the economy, it’s going to take more than Beijing’s blessing to get shopaholics back in force, beyond some revenge spending. AmEx, whose slogan is “Don’t Live Life Without It,” may find becoming indispensable in China its toughest sell yet. (1) In 2012, the World Trade Organization ruled in favor of a U.S. claim that argued foreign payment providers should have been given access to the domestic clearing market in 2001, when China acceded to the WTO.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 9.49%.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 17.79 in the Credit Services industry, Visa Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 34.69.

2020-06-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Markus Braun’s almost two decades as Wirecard AG’s chief executive officer ended after accusations about the company’s accounting culminated in a shock disclosure that it was unable to locate 1.9 billion euros ($2.1 billion).James Freis has been appointed interim CEO, the German payments company said in a short statement Friday. A recent hire and former compliance executive at Deutsche Boerse AG, Freis was only named as a member of the management board on Thursday.Braun’s exit comes after a catastrophic few days for Wirecard, which suffered a share price collapse after the two Asian banks that were alleged to be holding the missing cash denied any business relationship with the company.Read More: Germany’s Fintech Star Falls on Failure to Clean Up WirecardWirecard is now facing a potential cash crunch. The company warned Thursday that loans of as much as 2 billion euros could be terminated if its audited annual report is not published on Friday. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that Wirecard has available cash of around 220 million euros if it cannot locate the missing $2.1 billion.Wirecard’s lenders are considering hiring outside help as they seek to navigate the risk of a potentially massive default, a person familiar with the matter said.Named CEO in 2002, Braun has put tens of millions of euros of his own funds into the firm. The value of his stake, which once made him a paper billionaire, has dwindled in the course of the rout.His replacement is stepping into an almost unprecedented situation. Freis wasn’t supposed to join until July, when he was going to be responsible for a newly created department called “Integrity, Legal and Compliance.”Freis was previously head of compliance at Deutsche Boerse AG, and held the position of Director of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, where he was responsible for the regulation of financial institutions.The interim CEO will need to quickly reassure Wirecard’s business partners. Wirecard has licenses with Visa, Mastercard and JCB International, through which Wirecard’s banking arm issues its credit cards. If Wirecard is unable to find its missing cash, Visa and Mastercard may have cause to revoke the licenses.“The big question is whether they retain the Visa and Mastercard licenses,” Neil Campling, analyst at Mirabaud said. “Without those they have no business.”Mastercard said it is following the developments at Wirecard but did not want to comment on specific customer conversations or situations. Visa did not have an immediate comment.Missing CashWirecard claimed on Thursday that auditor Ernst & Young couldn’t confirm the location of the missing cash that was supposed to be held at two Asian banks and reported that “spurious balance confirmations” had been provided.The confusion deepened on Friday when BDO Unibank Inc., the Philippines’ largest bank by assets, and the Bank of the Philippine Islands, said on Friday that Wirecard isn’t a client.“It was a rogue employee who falsified documents and forged the signatures of our officers,” BDO Unibank CEO Nestor Tan said in a mobile phone message. “Wirecard is not even a depositor -- we have no relationship with them.”A document purporting to show a link between Wirecard and the Bank of the Philippine Islands was “bogus” and may be part of an attempted fraud, the president of the Southeast Asian lender said in a phone interview.Wirecard shares plunged as much as 52% in Frankfurt on Friday. The selloff in Wirecard’s bonds also intensified, with the company’s 500 million-euro bonds maturing in 2024 falling a further 14 cents to trade at 24 cents. Its 900 million euros of convertible bonds are now indicated at less than 10 cents on the euro.Wirecard was worth 24.6 billion euros in September 2018 when it entered Germany’s Dax index, and widely considered as one of Germany’s few successful fintech stories. It was valued at about 2.4 billion euros on Friday morning.Wirecard spokespeople did not return calls and emails for comment.Historic SlumpWirecard’s reversal of fortune has caught its supporters off guard. Some of the company’s most loyal shareholders are now dumping their stakes as allegations of accounting impropriety engulf the German payments company. Analysts are also quickly changing their recommendations, despite continued concerns about the company’s accounting.As of Wednesday, 10 out of 25 analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommended buying the stock. Since then, at least nine analysts have removed their recommendations and three have downgraded the stock to sell.German financial markets regulator BaFin said it is also examining Wirecard’s disclosure on Thursday as part of its investigation into whether the company violated rules against market manipulation, according to a spokeswoman.BaFin has three investigations of Wirecard running: whether the company manipulated markets with its disclosures, whether Braun’s stock purchase ahead of the planned publication of the company’s annual report violated market abuse roles and whether the company and its management are fit to be the owners of a bank.Fraud ClaimsBraun has previously painted the company as a potential victim, resisting calls to resign and aggressively defending Wirecard against accusations of accounting fraud, led by a series of articles in the Financial Times.“It cannot be ruled out that Wirecard has been the victim in a substantial case of fraud,” Braun said in a statement published overnight.The company temporarily suspended its outgoing Chief Operating Officer Jan Marsalek, it said in a statement late Thursday. Marsalek -- who has been suspended on a revocable basis until June 30 -- had tried to get in touch with the two Asian banks and trustees over the past two days to recover the missing money, but wasn’t successful, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday. It’s unclear if the funds can be recovered, the person added.German politicians are now asking how such a rapid collapse could happen to a fintech company that was once worth more than Deutsche Bank, and previously supported by local regulators.

2020-06-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. will dispatch workers to small businesses across the U.S. to help shops reopen and encourage additional use of its cards.The payment network’s efforts will start in the 50 largest U.S. cities in coming weeks, with Visa hoping to ultimately reach 200,000 small businesses. Workers will educate merchants on options they have for accepting electronic payments and provide them with new signs to let customers know they’re open.In some cases, the so-called street teams will give businesses signs that encourage customers to tap their credit and debit cards instead of dipping -- a technology that is relatively new to the U.S. and has gotten a boost from the pandemic, with virus-conscious consumers preferring contact-free shopping.“Tap-to-pay sits alongside face masks and hand sanitizer” at the checkout counter now, Suzan Kereere, Visa’s global head of merchant sales and acquiring, said in an interview. “That’s how shopping happens in this new normal.”The plan comes after Visa and its competitors were hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Spending on the firm’s cards slowed dramatically in recent months as governments around the world ordered businesses to close and people to stay at home to slow the spread of the deadly virus.Visa’s street teams are part of a broader company effort to help 50 million small businesses around the world as they begin to reopen. The network is also establishing the Visa Economic Empowerment Institute to study problems including post-crisis recovery and opportunity gaps, and is developing new card rewards to encourage people to shop locally.“It is unlikely that recovery will be a short spell,” Kereere said. “It will take some time for businesses and for most individuals to get back to whatever a new normal looks like.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Visa Dispatches ‘Street Teams’ to Call on Small U.S. Businesses

2020-06-23,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump signed an order Monday temporarily halting access to several employment-based visas, affecting hundreds of thousands of people seeking to work in the U.S. The technology industry said the move would hurt the economy.The order freezes new H1-B and H-4 visas, used by technology workers and their families, as well as L visas for intra-company transfers and most J visas for work- and study-abroad programs, including au pairs, through the end of the year.The issuance of new green cards will also remain halted through the end of the year.The new action will pause some H2-B visas for seasonal workers, with an exception for those in the food-processing industry, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters Monday.Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. called the order “short-sighted,” saying immigrant tech labor could help the U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said on Twitter he was “disappointed” and that “we’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all.” Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet the order goes too far.India’s NASSCOM, the trade body representing IT service giants like Infosys Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., called the Trump administration’s decision “misguided and harmful to the US economy.” Noting the benefits that overseas workers bring, it said in a statement that “Without their continued contributions to the U.S. economy, the economic pain would worsen, industry would slow, and the timeline for a treatment and cure of Covid-19 would lengthen.”Trump acted with the U.S. facing an unemployment rate of 13.3% after businesses closed or reduced staff in response to the virus outbreak. The president’s order won’t affect immigrant workers who already hold the visas.“Under the extraordinary circumstances of the economic contraction resulting from the Covid-19 outbreak, certain nonimmigrant visa programs authorizing such employment pose an unusual threat to the employment of American workers,” Trump said in his order.Speaking Saturday in an interview with Fox News, Trump said he wants Americans to take jobs that would otherwise go to people granted the visas.“We have plenty of people looking for jobs,” he told Fox. “I think it’s going to make a lot of people very happy. And it’s common sense.”Trump tweeted at the height of the coronavirus pandemic that he planned to “temporarily suspend immigration into the U.S.” Industry groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Information Technology Industry Council, wrote to Trump to express concern that restrictions would disrupt business and hamper growth.The U.S. issued more than 900,000 visas in fiscal year 2019 in the categories Trump plans to freeze.H-1B CriticismIn the past few years, the administration has moved to tighten the H-1B program, and the approval rate for applications has fallen. The technology industry relies on H-1B visas to hire overseas talent, particularly in the fields of science and engineering. Critics say some companies have abused the program to displace American workers.About three-quarters of H-1B visas go to people working in the technology industry, though the exact levels vary year by year. The number of non-immigrant visas issued in 2019 declined for the fourth consecutive year, to 8.7 million from 10.9 million in 2015, according to the State Department.CompTIA, a trade group that represents big tech companies like Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet Inc. said the move would deal a lasting blow to the economy.“Making it more difficult for bright minds to work in the U.S. only benefits our competitors abroad who will attract their talents to build and develop cutting-edge, job-creating goods and services,” said Cinnamon Rogers, CompTIA’s executive vice president for public advocacy.TechNet, a lobbying group that represents most of the largest tech companies, had been pushing for the Trump administration to show leniency to the hundreds of thousands of H-1B holders already in the U.S. who lost their jobs in the Covid-19 pandemic and now risk falling into illegal status.Nandini Nair, an immigration partner at Greenspoon Marder, said the new order would have an “enormous effect” on U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector. Many spent thousands of dollars filing paperwork for each H-1B visa applicant, she said.“They expended all of this money and planned their budgets and workforce capabilities on these visas and that’s now shot,” Nair said.The order not only limits the ability of companies to recruit talent from overseas, but also impacts their current foreign workers who have been waiting to get their visas authorized. When an H-1B visa is awarded to individuals, they must travel to a consulate outside the U.S., typically in their home country, to activate it.Many workers have been unable to travel since the coronavirus pandemic shut borders across the world. “A lot of these workers are now prisoners in the U.S. because they don’t have a valid visa stamp in their passport -- if they go, they can’t come back in,” Nair said.However, Fragomen Worldwide immigration lawyer James Pack, who provides counsel to businesses in the tech sector, said the executive order would only have a limited impact on U.S. companies because it only applies to first-time H-1B applicants who are outside the country. Those already working for firms inside the U.S. would not be impacted, Pack said.The current cap for those visas is 85,000 annually. H-4 visas are issued to immediate family members of H-1B visa holders.The H1-B program will be restructured to put an emphasis on would-be immigrants with the highest salary offers once the program restarts next year, the senior administration official said. Under such changes, entry-level workers coming from colleges are less likely to get the visa, as the spots will mostly go to people who have master’s degrees or doctorates working in high-earning fields such as trading, algorithms, and IT, said Shannon Donnelly, a partner and immigration attorney at Morgan Lewis.(Updates with comment from India’s NASSCOM in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Orders Freeze on Many Work Visas Through End of Year

2020-06-24,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s Central Bank and antitrust regulator suspended Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp messenger payment features in the country, the app’s second-biggest market with more than 120 million users.The bank decision aims to “preserve an adequate competitive environment, that ensures the functioning of a payment system that’s interchangeable, fast, secure, transparent, open and cheap,” the monetary authority said in a statement on its website. Bank authorities requested that Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. stop payment and money transfer activities through the app.Meanwhile, Brazil’s antitrust regulator, known as Cade, said on Wednesday it is suspending WhatsApp’s partnership with electronic payment company Cielo preemptively. According to an statement on the regulator’s website, the vast WhatsApp user database coupled with Cielo’s high market share in payments could prove too high a barrier for any new competitors. Since the deal wasn’t presented for evaluation, regulators needed to act fast to avoid competition concerns, the statement read.A suspension without presenting further arguments is “an unusual, extraordinary move by the central bank, especially in payments arrangements and technology market,” said Tiago Severo Gomes, a partner at Caputo, Bastos and Serra and a specialist in fintechs and banking regulation.The decisions are a setback for Facebook, which introduced WhatsApp’s payments system in Brazil earlier this month after testing it over the past two years in a handful of markets, including India and Mexico. Payments are a key element of WhatsApp’s long-term plan to offer commerce within the app. More than 5 million merchants around the world use a business version of the messenger app, and in countries like India and Brazil, WhatsApp serves as the main or only online presence for many mom-and-pop retailers.“Our goal is to provide digital payments to all WhatsApp users in Brazil using an open model and we will continue to work with local partners and the Central Bank to make this possible,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said. ”In addition, we support the Central Bank’s PIX project on digital payments and together with our partners are committed to work with the Central Bank to integrate our systems when PIX becomes available,” the spokesperson said, referring to Brazil’s proposed instant-payment system.The company was surprised by the Central Bank’s decision, and the two sides were in regular contact in the run-up to the payments launch, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named discussing private deliberations.Brazil’s Central Bank said the suspension will let it evaluate any possible risk to the country’s system of payments and to determine whether the payments system meets the necessary rules. Starting the service without the regulator’s green light could generate “irreparable damage to the system, especially what concerns competition, efficiency and data privacy,” the banks said, adding that Mastercard and Visa could face fines if they don’t comply.In a regulatory filing, Cielo said they suspended the services, and will keep the shareholders informed of developments.(Adds antitrust regulator comments in the third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Brazilian Authorities Suspend WhatsApp Payments

2020-06-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Africa’s burgeoning mobile-banking industry has gained fresh momentum with governments boosting payments through phones, a measure aimed at curbing the coronavirus by reducing the physical exchange of cash.Kenya is ramping up its use of technology platforms offered by Vodafone Group Plc’s M-Pesa, Airtel Kenya Ltd. and Telkom Kenya Ltd. since the pandemic to disburse aid directly to businesses and individuals using mobile money rather than through banks or food parcels. Ghana on Wednesday also started pumping stimulus to at least 100,000 micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises using mobile money.Pioneered by Vodafone’s Nairobi-based Safaricom Plc in 2007, mobile money has become an indispensable part of how Africa’s 1.2 billion people pay for goods and services, buy funeral cover or borrow money, without a smartphone. Now, the need from governments to find a quick and safe way of sending funds during the pandemic is underscoring the service’s increasingly systemic role.“Government disbursing monies via M-Pesa shows high integrity has been accorded to the platform,” said Tracy Kivunyu, an analyst at Tellimer Ltd. in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.While Europeans are shunning cash for cards over hygiene concerns, some African nations lack the infrastructure to rely only on plastic. As restrictions on movement to curb Covid-19 infections prevent customers from accessing cash, more are turning to mobile money to fill the gap. After Kenya’s partial lockdown started in March, a million new users joined M-Pesa, taking subscribers to 25 million, or about three quarters of Kenyans over 15.In Ghana, mobile money purchases reached a record in March, according to central bank data, while a cash shortage in Zimbabwe means 90% of transactions are done digitally. Nigerian startup digital bank Kuda said it opened more accounts in April than the prior three months combined. Togo, a nation of eight million, was able to distribute emergency financial support to 500,000 people, mostly women, in less than two weeks using mobile phones, according to the International Monetary Fund.Top Market“These changes, triggered by Covid-19, have enabled the acceleration and scaling of cashless and digital economies,” said Serigne Dioum, head of mobile-financial services at MTN Group, the continent’s largest wireless carrier. “They support our ambition to transition to an end-to-end platform, creating a digital market place, connecting consumers to businesses, and businesses to businesses.”Mobile money is the fastest-growing source of income for wireless-network operators like Johannesburg-based MTN and the African units of Newbury, England-based Vodafone Group. Sub-Saharan Africa has more mobile-money accounts than anywhere else in the world, with about 396 million at the end of 2018, or 46% of all customers, according to the GSMA, the global mobile-operator industry group.Heightened reluctance to use potentially virus-spreading cash will probably continue once the economies rebound, Peter Ndegwa, the chief executive officer of Safaricom, who took the post in April, said in an interview. M-Pesa is used by more than 37 million people across seven African countries.The crisis has also quickened the next phase of M-Pesa’s development: a bigger push into financial services for Kenya’s small- to medium-sized businesses. Expanding revenue streams into business-related payments will help generate higher margins from M-Pesa’s ecosystem, said Tellimer’s Kivunyu.Safaricom has 173,000 merchant partners who can receive payments over M-Pesa and has the technology to enable more services once regulatory approvals are granted.“In terms of employment, the small business sector is the lifeline of this country,” Ndegwa said. That led to a partnership between Safaricom and Visa Inc. to explore and develop digital payment systems to further expand M-Pesa’s reach. It also ties into Safaricom’s strategy of coaxing more people onto 4G devices, which would let customers access more sophisticated financial services. Most Kenyans don’t have internet-enabled phones, so half of M-Pesa transfers are made via text message.In Ghana, companies other than mobile network operators can now get licenses, which could prompt a drop in prices with more competition, said Archie Hesse, CEO of Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Ltd. Ghana is disbursing part of its 600 million cedis ($104 million) Covid-19 stimulus package via mobile money, said Kosi Yankey-Ayeh, executive director of the National Board for Small Scale Industries.The start of MTN’s mobile-money service in Nigeria in August, along with initial approvals for Globacom Ltd. and 9Mobile, means a sleeping giant is awakening in Africa’s most populous country, long served only by banks. Uzoma Dozie, CEO of Sparkle Ltd., a Lagos-based digital bank that began operations this month, expects to reach half a million customers in the next 18 months.“This pandemic has been a defining moment for mobile-money providers, said Akinwale Goodluck, head of Sub-Saharan Africa for GSMA. “It indicates that Africa can lead the world in digital financial transformation toward a cashless society.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Virus Is Hastening Mobile-Banking Pioneer’s Race to Replace Cash

2020-06-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Indian and U.S. technology companies are urging the Trump administration to reconsider an executive order freezing access to many work visas, warning the move would undermine a business model used to supply high-skill talent to clients from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.Donald Trump’s order last week halts approvals of a range of visas through year-end, including those for intra-company transfers and study-abroad programs, and is aimed at giving Americans preference after record job losses from the coronavirus pandemic. Key for the tech industry are H-1B visas used by workers from India and other countries to fill key roles.Visa processing is an elaborate, months-long affair so any disruption could hurt the ability of critical workers to travel to clients sites for an extended period. Already, the virus lockdowns have blocked consulate visits essential to the process and forced hundreds of thousands of workers into challenging work-from-home situations.India’s technology trade group, Nasscom, called Trump’s order “misguided and harmful to the U.S. economy” and warned it would exacerbate the country’s economic pain. Indian companies provide technology staff and services to U.S. hospitals, drugmakers and biotechnology companies, Nasscom pointed out. In addition, the industry may send more workers to Canada or Mexico without access to the U.S. market.“These are highly-skilled workers who are in great demand and they will be mobile no matter what,” said Shivendra Singh, president of global trade development at Nasscom.Among the other critics of the order were Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith and Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk. Pichai, himself a beneficiary of the H-1B visa system in the 1990s, tweeted, “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today.”Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys Ltd. and Wipro Ltd., among the largest outsourcing companies in Asia, declined to comment.India accounts for about 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued annually, according to immigration data. Of this total, 65,000 visas are issued to foreign talent with bachelor’s degrees, while the remaining 20,000 can be allotted to workers who have more advanced degrees.The visa system was conceived so companies could hire overseas workers to fill a shortage of high-skilled talent in technology services and product development. The fact that Indian outsourcers collect a substantial share of the visas each year has made the program controversial, with critics arguing that companies abuse the system by replacing American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Soon after taking office, Trump vowed he would crack down on work visas and reform the “broken” immigration system. One longer-term concern for outsourcers is the administration’s planned revamp of the current H-1B visa program, which would replace the current lottery system for determining who gets visas with a merit-based system that prioritizes applicants based on wages. That would mean more workers with high salaries would likely receive visas.Now, outsourcing companies are dealing with the unpredictability of the visa situation and the prospect that an H-1B revamp could make it difficult to send anyone but the most critical of talent overseas.Trump Orders Freeze on Many Work Visas Through End of Year The most recent visa curbs could hammer outsourcers’ current model of talent deployment. Companies are beginning to question whether so much onsite travel is necessary, and some are ramping up local hiring or local subcontractors. The pandemic has prompted companies to look at worker clusters away from client sites but close enough to collaborate on projects. For instance, if a company has 20,000 employees spread across 40 cities, these could be aggregated in a few clusters and if the visa restrictions continue, the clusters may not be in Texas or New Jersey but in Canada or Mexico.“Offshoring could increase because, for clients, the virus lockdowns have already driven home the merits of remote working,” said Singh, speaking over the phone from New Delhi.Indian companies could see an impact on their margins because of increased worker salaries, higher costs of local hiring and subcontracting and the collateral damage from visa rejections and prolonged processing times. “The temporary suspension of H-1B visa programme till December 2020 will hamper execution of pipeline and new projects coupled with margin impact resulting from higher onshore hiring,” credit rating company ICRA said in a note last week.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Visa Freeze Endangers India Tech Industry’s Talent Model

2020-07-02,"This is the most enthusiasm I've ever seen in stock markets. Not from the size of the rally, but rather because the indices are setting all-time highs in the face of the toughest economic conditions ever. We still have 20 million people unemployed, if not more. Yet Wall Street is blindly buying tech ETFs in droves. The equity markets have already recovered in a &quot;v&quot; and more. The government aide packages are hiding the deep wounds that still exist in our economy. Just this morning, Congress passed the extension of the Paycheck Protection Program.Much of the risk appetite is favoring high risk momentum stocks. These are companies whose products and services serve the new world order of digital delivery and subscription models. Some of the ones making new highs are Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and even the older gurus like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The Nasdaq recovered best out of the quarantine crash, and in fact it has already set all-time-highs this morning with no let-up in sight.The bulls are tag-teaming MVP's, so they sell one group to rotate into another. For a while they chase mega-cap tech like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Then on other days when they sell those, they roll their profits into frothier tickers like ZM and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI am usually optimistic about the stock markets, but I have serious worries these days. Last year, I wrote about buying every dip stemming from the China trade war headlines. This is different because the U.S. went from full employment last year to maximum unemployment this year. The economic reports may look fine, but the wound from the quarantine is bleeding internally. This is not evident while the government is spending trillions of dollars supporting the deficit. The election season will pass and the politicians will lose interest in quantitative easing programs.Caution is warranted while markets behave like it's 1999. Investors should fade this extreme exuberance in the Nasdaq using the following three exchange-traded funds. I feel a little guilty for my negative tone, but in my defense, I suggested going long on the April 21 dip. Back then, it served as the base for this incredible 25% rally in these tech ETFs:  * Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ)  * VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH)  * Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK)I will start by sharing my order of preference on these bearish bets. Out of these three tech ETFs, the SMH seems the weakest because it has the most lower-highs in the last two weeks. Then the XLK because it has at least one recent failed breakout. Finally, only the QQQ is in open space and has no recent fails since it just made new highs. Tech ETFs to Trade: Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)Source: Charts by TradingView The QQQ is the main Nasdaq ETF that traders most often use. It is heavily concentrated with the top dogs and they are the great American companies led by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). The top five make up almost half of the the entire basket. The call today is to fade the rally into the Fall season. Placing a bearish bet on the QQQ stock is simple when using options. Shorting the stock outright is too risky because it opens unlimited risk for as long as the rally continues.I realize that doing this now is going against the grain because it suggests fighting the Federal Reserve and the tape. Using options, investors can buy a long-term debit put spread to capture at least a 10% correction. This is a directional position that needs a drop to profit and time is its enemy. At the close of yesterday, traders could buy the December $242 / $232 debit put spread for $3 debit. This is the maximum potential loss per contract. To win, the QQQ has to fall ideally through both legs. The maximum upside potential is then $7 per contract. Those who have a bigger risk appetite can buy the $232 put naked for a cost of $12.80 per contract. In this runaway market that's a big ask.To lower or eliminate the entry cost, an alternative method is sell bear call spreads, which would leave room for error. The advantage here is that profits can come without a correction. All it needs to win is that the QQQ not rally more than 10% from here. For example, the December $280 / $285 credit call spread could pay $1.50 per contract. The advantage of this is that the price can rally and it can still win. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)Source: Charts by TradingView The XLK is another popular tech ETF and it is also heavily weighted with Microsoft and Apple, which make up more than 40% of it. But the XLK is also heavily influenced by Fintech. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to name three make up almost 15% of it. This complicates matters a little bit for the bears because they would be shorting two different hot concepts. Wall Street is not only in love with tech, but they are almost even more enamored with Financial Tech. PYPL stock rallied 115% off the Covid-19 low and is now miles above its prior highs. This is a good illustration of my concern.I understand the concept of momentum trading very well, but I usually prefer chasing a specific breakout. In this case, the bids are system wide and investors are buying whatever regardless of thesis. Investing is not that easy and there will be pain for many. The first step is to avoid chasing into such froth, and placing a few bearish bets makes sense. Both concepts here are over extended, so they are vulnerable to hiccups.Again, here the easy method is to buy some downside scenarios in the put options out until the end of the year. Placing shorter-term bets could pay quicker but then time becomes a worse liability. The XLK stock is just as exposed as the QQQ, so it comes down to a matter of taste. I find it easier to manage my trade with the QQQ than this one.The XLK has support through $100 per share, but if they lose it, the bears could try to target another $5 drop. Once again, my call today is not one of doom and gloom, but it would be normal to retrace prices back to the May breakout levels without changing the overall bullish thesis. The bulls can retain control for as long as they maintain the higher-low trend. Meaning, I would buy the dips when they come. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)Source: Charts by TradingView Another concept that investors are loving this year are chip stocks and they are best represented by the SMH. This tech ETF is heavily weighted by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). These three account for almost 30% of the fund. I am a big fan of Intel and Nvidia stock and I wrote about buying every dip in them. Like the XLK, SMH's chart has support just below current levels and a pivot zone at $142 per share. The bulls will defend the zone vigorously because they are an emotional bunch over these stocks. To short the SMH from relative safety, buy the Nov $130 / $120 debit put spread for under $2 per contract. This is a reasonably priced opportunity to capitalize on a correction this Fall.As noted earlier, these ideas go against the grain when it comes to tech ETFs. In addition, the Nasdaq is going into a seasonally bullish period. Although, I don't usually trade hype like this, it is important to acknowledge that this is yet another reason why shorting this insane rally caries unusual risk. The methods discussed today use finite potential, so they are not reckless. There are dozens of other ways to approach tech ETFs today, but simple vertical put spreads are the easiest to explain and execute.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2020-07-10,"(Bloomberg) -- The chief executive officer of Asia’s largest IT services firm warned that a U.S. freeze on thousands of employment visas will only raise costs for American corporations like Wall Street banks, auto manufacturers and drugmakers.Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. CEO Rajesh Gopinathan told Bloomberg News the move has put massive stress on a huge swath of Indian-born engineers that have lived in the U.S. for years and helped support American clients, who will ultimately be the ones hurt most. His remarks were among the strongest public rebukes from India’s $181 billion IT industry since U.S. President Donald Trump’s June decree to halt approvals for a range of visas until the end of the year -- including those for intra-company transfers.TCS and peers like Infosys Ltd. have relied for years on the ability to send talent to work alongside their customers overseas, which include some of the largest electronics manufacturers and global retailers. Investors worry that the inability to do so will hurt their competitiveness in the largest international market.“The ignorance around this ruling should be addressed,” Gopinathan said via video conference on Friday. “Playing with the status of people who’ve moved away from families and committed to spending five-six years in a foreign country without immigrant status to deliver value to customers, is a short-term gimmick,” the executive said.Read more: Tata Consultancy Profit Misses as Lockdowns Snarl ServicesOn Thursday, TCS reported profit below expectations after the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted operations of its clients from Wall Street banks to Silicon Valley tech giants. The visa curbs had no material impact on TCS’s own business but will certainly upset its workers, Gopinathan said. “The attitude towards us in a country where we contribute significantly is unexpected and unfortunate.”Before the onset of the pandemic, TCS and the rest of India’s 4-million-workers-strong IT services industry faced pressure from structural industry changes. With the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, companies had to retrain thousands of workers and invest in new cloud- and software-based services to address clients’ evolving needs. Trump’s visa ban last month has added a further layer of uncertainty.“We invest in skills and make this talent available in a fungible manner for use by customers,” Gopinathan said from his office in Mumbai’s business district. This helps clients avoid “large fixed costs to have access to this kind of talent.”The investment by TCS and its peers helps American firms tap a pool of talent that’s continuously adapting to new technology, he said, adding he continues to work from the office because it’s close to his home and offers the familiarity of old work routines.Gopinathan started his career at TCS in 2001, becoming chief financial officer in 2013. He took over the helm in 2017 when his predecessor was promoted to restore stability at conglomerate Tata Group after a bitter boardroom coup. Gopinathan has presided over a doubling in TCS’s market value since, a reflection of the corporation’s effort to pivot to newer services.TCS has seen a surge in demand for its services from clients enhancing their digital infrastructure and accelerating cloud migration to cope with Covid-19. “Overall, the pandemic has hastened the move towards distributed infrastructure,” he said.(Updates with additional details of industry and pandemic fallout from sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Asia IT Giant’s CEO Warns Trump’s Visa Curbs Will Cost U.S.

2020-07-15,"Visa Inc (NYSE: V) shares are up 12.7% in the past three months, but at least one larger option trader is betting on more upside from the credit card giant as the US economy begins to open back up.The Visa TradeOn Wednesday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received an option alert related to an unusually large Visa trade.  * At 11:48 a.m., a trader bought 3,878 Visa call options with a $205 strike price expiring in September 2021 at the ask price of $22.25. The trade represented a more than $8.6 million bullish bet.Why It's ImportantEven traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader.Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock.Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there's no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of Wednesday's Visa option trade it could certainly be institutional hedging.Goldman Bump?The huge call option purchase comes just one day after Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew O'Neill initiated coverage of Visa with a Buy rating and $223 price target. O'Neill said payments and IT services stocks could actually benefit from a rise in contactless payments and online retail sales due to COVID-19. O'Neill also said Visa has a differentiated payments business and is diversified across different sectors.Benzinga's TakeThe $8.6 million call purchase has a break-even price of $227.25, suggesting 15.5% upside for the stock over the next 14 months. Visa is expected to report earnings on July 28, but the calls are dated so far into the future that it's not necessarily a play on an earnings beat or miss.Prior to the health crisis, Visa was forecasting double-digit revenue growth for the full year.

2020-07-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Sudan’s government calls itself transitional, but what it is attempting is transformational. In the latest raft of reforms announced earlier this month, it abolished a law against apostasy, ended punishment by flogging, criminalized female genital mutilation, dropped rules requiring women to get a permit from a male family member to travel with their children — and loosened prohibitions on the sale and consumption of alcohol.Last week, the government also began the final phase of peace talks with rebels that could see the latter join the administration.Still a month short of its first anniversary, the government — headed by a council of civilian and military representatives, and led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, a former United Nations economist — seems determined to dismantle, without delay, the poisonous legacy of the ousted former dictator Omar al-Bashir. Sudanese activists and international rights groups are cheering it on.It is also being encouraged by the Trump administration, which has upgraded diplomatic ties. After a gap of more than two decades, Washington now has a Sudanese ambassador. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the U.S. will appoint an ambassador to Khartoum.But the U.S. continues to hold out on the gesture that would mean the most to the transitional government: removing Sudan from the State Department’s list of countries that sponsor terrorism. The designation, which it shares with Iran, North Korea and Syria, restricts the country’s access to aid, investment and remittances.As I wrote last year, shortly after Hamdok’s appointment, Sudan doesn’t belong on that list. Indeed, many in the national security establishment in Washington argue that it should have been dropped years ago. For all his tyranny, even Bashir had long been cooperating with American counterterrorism efforts. The Trump administration acknowledged this in 2017, when it removed most U.S. sanctions on Sudan.And yet, the U.S. remains reluctant to take the final step, even though the transitional government has repeatedly demonstrated its eagerness to curry Washington’s favor. Pompeo’s explanation, that “we always measure twice and cut once before we remove someone from a list like that,” is vague at best.There are other voices in Washington counseling caution. Keeping Sudan on the list, they say, gives the U.S. leverage over the military, to ensure that it doesn’t undermine the democratizing process. Better to save delisting as the final reward, for an elected government after the three-year transition has been completed.The risk of recidivism exists, of course. Witness a violent mutiny by members of the intelligence services in January. In March, Hamdok escaped an assassination attempt. Although the government has been able to imprison Bashir and some of his closest lieutenants — they face trial for genocide and other war crimes at the International Criminal Court — other dangerous figures in fatigues still wield considerable power in Khartoum. Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti,” leader of the infamous Janjaweed militias blamed for the genocide in Darfur, now runs the Rapid Support Forces, and portrays himself as a hero in the country’s fight against the coronavirus.But to imagine that keeping Sudan on the terrorism-sponsors list will ward off counter-revolutionary forces is to greatly exaggerate American leverage — and to underestimate the protest movement that brought down Bashir. The protesters maintain a sharp-eyed vigilance on the military, and despite the pandemic, have kept up pressure on the government to stay the course on reforms.Certainly, they could use international help to keep the government honest. To prevent backsliding in Khartoum, the U.S. has plenty of carrots and sticks it can use.Smoothing the way for investment and aid, for instance, would allow Hamdok to rebuild Sudan’s economy, which was decrepit even before the pandemic. Some investors, having taken their own measure of Africa’s third-largest country, are not waiting on a formal delisting. American companies ranging from Visa Inc and Oracle to Yum! Brands (which owns Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut) have announced partnerships in Sudan. International donors last month pledged $2 billion in aid. Many more would undoubtedly be emboldened to follow if the terrorism-sponsorship designation were removed. And success on the economic front would do much to legitimize civilian rule.Moreover, the threat of sanctions should suffice as a disincentive. After all, for those who need reminding, being taken off the list of terrorism sponsors is not a permanent condition: North Korea was delisted in 2008, and subsequently relisted by the Trump administration.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Bobby Ghosh is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-07-24,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Earnings season reaches its peak next week at an interesting time for the markets. After shaky trading of late, and the reaction to earnings so far, bears have to be somewhat emboldened.After all, investors don't seem to like what they're heard so far. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell after earnings reports that were good, but evidently not good enough. The market shrugged at a solid release from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And value plays like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) sparked little optimism with their numbers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe argument that U.S. equities have run too far seems to be gaining some traction, at least looking at the reaction to corporate earnings reports. Yet broad market indices don't show much pressure: The S&P 500 is up so far this week while the Nasdaq Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have slipped modestly.Of course, that includes a worrisome decline on Thursday, in which U.S. stocks closed at the lows. And ahead of an absolutely stacked docket of reports next week, muted reactions to earnings will start to make their way into those indices.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever As a result, the market may well be at an inflection point. If it is, these seven earnings reports could go a long way toward determining trading not just week, but for the near term:  * Visa (NYSE:V)  * Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)  * Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  * Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)  * Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  * Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Earnings Reports to Watch: Visa (V)Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, July 28, after market close We know fiscal third-quarter earnings from Visa are going to be soft. The same is true of rival Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which reports on Thursday.After all, Visa said at the time of its Q2 report in early May that processed transactions growth declined nearly 30% year-over-year in April, the first month of the quarter. Reopening efforts worldwide likely helped May and June numbers, but Wall Street still expects revenue to decline 17% in the quarter.But the question for Visa stock is one that's been asked in this space for the last few months: Will investors care? Somewhat logically, the market generally has decided that near-term numbers in an unprecedented environment simply aren't that important. The size of the reactions to earnings reports appears to have declined, particularly among large-cap companies, and quality names in particular have been given a long leash.Visa earnings represent the first test next week of precisely how long that leash is. And it looks like a truly pure test. Despite the pandemic and the risk of a recession, V stock has rallied 5% so far in 2020. It's difficult to imagine what Visa can deliver on Tuesday afternoon that would surprise investors enough to bring in new buyers.To be sure, Visa's numbers are worth looking at closely, given its insights into consumer and business spending worldwide. But it's the reaction to Visa stock on Wednesday that could set the tone for the rest of a key week for the market. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, July 29, before market openFor Shopify, too, trading on Wednesday will be quite interesting. While V stock has rallied 5% amid a pandemic, SHOP stock has gained a stunning 133%. That puts pressure on Wednesday's report, particularly with a chart that looks a bit dangerous at the moment.But relative to Visa, there's more uncertainty about what Shopify's actual numbers will look like. Demand clearly has shifted to e-commerce amid stay-at-home orders, but the size of that tailwind isn't yet known. We haven't seen a major e-commerce player report yet, so Shopify will be setting the pace.For SHOP itself, from here, the release looks potentially dicey. The reaction to earnings from Tesla and Netflix at the least suggests that Shopify has a high bar to clear. It wouldn't be a surprise to see investors sell the earnings news here as they did with those other growth names.Given SHOP's rally, and the strength in growth stocks more broadly, that could be yet another warning sign for a group that has led the market for not just the last few months, but the last few years. Earnings Reports to Watch: Facebook (FB)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, July 29, after market closeSo far, earnings have been a split decision for social media. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) has faded despite what looked like an impressive report. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock, however, extended a rally after its Q2 report.Both companies, however, reported user growth and higher engagement during the pandemic. Facebook, which has faced on-and-off worries about its own user base, absolutely has to keep pace. Otherwise, the narrative of &quot;peak Facebook&quot; may take hold.It's likely the post-earnings conference call will drive headlines as well. Facebook has found itself in multiple political storms of late. The company needs to walk a narrow line in an enormously volatile environment, calming users and regulators in addition to shareholders. It's a lot to ask, but with FB stock stalling out in the low-$230 range, CEO Mark Zuckerberg probably needs to deliver to move his company's stock higher after earnings. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 30, before market openAside from the obvious names, there's a long list of earnings reports to watch next week. Procter & Gamble leads a group of major consumer names that includes McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Industrial names like General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are on the earnings calendar as well. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will try and take advantage of the optimism created by yet another delay at Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), while Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) will look to boost the struggling energy sector.P&G, however, might get the edge in the illustrious group. To at least some extent, other large-caps reporting next week all are facing significant short-term headwinds that will impact their numbers for the quarter. Procter & Gamble, however, has benefited from a stay-at-home tailwind. That tailwind seemed like it was fading in June. Particularly in the U.S., however, it may be picking up again. And that might be enough to continue the 2020 rally in consumer staples.For P&G itself, the quarter is big. PG stock is trying to challenge all-time highs, and trades now at early year levels. A multi-year turnaround effort finally seems to be gaining traction, and the consumer giant needs to prove that it can take advantage of positive conditions. With many fellow staples plays reporting this week and next, P&G has to change to boost its stock and provide a lift to its sector. Earnings Reports to Watch: Apple (AAPL)Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 30, after market closeAfter posting yet another historic rally -- Apple stock almost doubled from March lows to this month's all-time high -- Apple stock stumbled on Thursday. Reports of state-level probes and a recommendation by Goldman Sachs that investors &quot;avoid&quot; AAPL combined to send the stock down 4.5%.Trading on Thursday, and the rally over the past few months, both add some import to Apple's fiscal third-quarter report on Thursday afternoon. Rising U.S.-China tensions provide yet another risk. Apple needs to remind investors why they made Apple the most valuable company listed on U.S. exchanges.That might be tough. There's going to be some pandemic impact in the quarter. Valuation looks potentially questionable, with AAPL now trading at 24x forward earnings despite persistent worries about long-term unit growth for the iPhone.Heading into earnings, Apple stock seems a microcosm of the market as a whole. The stock was cheap, but now seems to have incorporated long-term optimism (in this case, toward the company's pivot into services). As a result, in a still-uncertain environment, it's difficult to predict what can inspire even more optimism -- and a higher share price.If Apple can deliver reason for that optimism, that bodes well for the market as a whole. But if the market's most valuable company stumbles after earnings, it's hard to see how that's anything but bad news for other U.S. stocks as earnings season rolls on. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 30, after market closeAmazon stock has been one of the biggest pandemic winners. Shares almost exactly doubled from March lows, adding roughly $800 billion in market value in the process.But here, too, there's been some shaky trading of late. Shares have pulled back 10% from the highs, with a rally last week fading quickly.Meanwhile, it was just a year ago that AMZN stock was falling after earnings. The expensive launch of one-day shipping pressured the profit outlook. Shares stayed stuck for the rest of the year.As a result, this looks like a tricky report. Expectations are going to be huge for both the e-commerce business and the Amazon Web Services cloud business. With Microsoft reporting 47% revenue growth for its Azure platform, AWS needs a blowout quarter to assuage any potential market share concerns.Amazon needs to deliver. And even if it does, investors need to keep paying up for what might be the most expensive growth stock in history. It seems like a tough combination, and post-earnings weakness here could read across to all of tech. Earnings Reports to Watch: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Source: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, July 30, after market closeSomewhat quietly, Alphabet stock rallied to all-time highs, and at least for now seems set to finally hold the $1 trillion level. But to extend the rally, particularly after a 3%-plus selloff on Thursday, Alphabet needs to drive some optimism next week.And it seems at this point like that optimism needs to come from a unit outside of the advertising business. As is the case elsewhere in tech, investors seem set to forgive near-term softness in ad prices.That's been enough for Alphabet to recover February and March losses. It doesn't necessarily seem like enough to push the stock materially higher from here, however. Self-driving unit Waymo is struggling. Efforts like Google Fiber and other &quot;moonshots&quot; haven't necessarily panned out.Alphabet spent $26 billion on research and development in 2019. The return on that investment isn't necessarily clear yet. But if the company can change that on Thursday, that could be the catalyst for GOOG stock to start catching up to its fellow tech titans.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-07-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. kept up its record-breaking streak Tuesday, briefly becoming the world’s 10th most valuable corporation before paring gains.Taiwan’s biggest stock was up around 1.2% in Taipei, after rising as much as 9.9% and going beyond $410 billion in value, leapfrogging U.S. giants Johnson & Johnson and Visa Inc. in the process. Daily stock moves are capped at 10% in Taiwan’s equity market.It’s difficult to overstate the influence that TSMC wields on Taiwan’s financial markets. Making up almost a third of the local benchmark, it has single-handedly pushed the Taiex past a record that had stood for three decades. Its rally is attracting foreign flows into Taiwanese equities, increasing demand for the local currency. The Taiwan dollar rose 1% Tuesday to the strongest since April 2018.The latest boost to TSMC’s shares came after Intel Corp. warned last week that its 7-nanometer chips are behind schedule and it may outsource their production. The U.S. chipmaker is expected to funnel new business to TSMC, given its global lead in silicon fabrication and track record of making semiconductors for the world’s largest tech corporations.Intel’s struggles are buoying stocks in Asian suppliers of made-to-order chips. Samsung Electronics Co., which is investing heavily in its own foundry business, jumped as much as 5.8% Tuesday, its biggest intraday gain in almost two months. Chinese rival Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. climbed 6.6% in Hong Kong.“Samsung Electronics’ position as a foundry partner is expected to rise. Korean investors anticipate that Samsung could produce Intel’s CPU and discrete GPU,” Hana Financial Investment analysts wrote in a note. But “to narrow the gap with TSMC, it is essential for Samsung to expand its Austin fab.”A report on Monday suggested that Intel had placed orders with TSMC for 180,000 units of 6nm chips for 2021. Meanwhile, brokerages including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded TSMC to the equivalent of buy.(Updates with share price and analyst comment from first paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",TSMC Pares Gains After $72 Billion Surge to Start the Week

In Q2, Visa earned $3.97 billion and total sales reached $5.85 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Visa posted an ROCE of 0.97%.View more earnings on VKeep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Visa is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. For Visa, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Visa reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.06/share against analyst predictions of $1.03/share.See more from Benzinga  * Visa's Price Over Earnings Overview  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Recap: Visa Q3 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

However non-GAAP EPS of $1.06 beat Street forecasts by $0.02, as did GAAP EPS of $1.07 which beat estimates by $0.03.Meanwhile, overall payment volume of $1.95T beat the analyst estimate of $1.90T.Through July 21, Visa said that U.S. payment volumes are up in the mid- to high-single digits, with debit outperforming credit. U.S. card not present (ecommerce) volumes are also relatively stable.Processed transactions have improved to roughly flat in July from down 4% year-over-year in June and 24% in April. Finally, cross- border volumes declined 44% year-over-year for both the month of June and the first three weeks of July.“Overall volume trends point to stabilization, while cross-border volumes / international fees continue to struggle given the lack of travel” commented RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin following the report. “However, contactless & new payment flows point to solid long-term growth” he added.Looking forward, Perlin believes that FQ4/20 results will have significant noise as service fees are calculated on a one-quarter lag. Management noted that if service fees had been calculated without the lag, FQ3/20 services fees would have declined (11%) y/y and total net revenue growth would have been 4.5ppt lower.“We believe that the lag and incentive percentage increase will result in FQ4/20 new revenue growth to be worse than FQ3/20’s y/y decline of (17%)” the analyst warned.Perlin nonetheless reiterated his buy rating on the stock but dropped his price target from $247 to $243. This still suggests significant upside potential from the current share price of $197.“Our valuation is based on our view that V will be able to expand its constituencies, improve its competitive position, and accelerate secular trends as we emerge into a more normalized phase of growth” he explained.Overall, Visa scores a bullish Strong Buy analyst consensus with an average analyst price target of $212 (8% upside potential). (See V stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Amazon Shares Rise As Analysts See More Upside  Intel Faces Analysts’ Wrath, Stock Slips Over 16%  Verizon (VZ) Stock Looks Attractive After Earnings, Says 5-Star Analyst More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Sanofi, GSK Agree UK Supply Deal For 60M Covid-19 Vaccine Doses   * Shopify Files For $7.5B Mixed Shelf Offering Ahead Of Earnings   * Pfizer Raises 2020 Profit Forecast On Recovery Outlook; Shares Leap 4%   * Avis Pops 10% In Extended Trading On Q2 Beat, Pick-Up In Rentals",Visa Pulls Back On Revenue Miss; RBC Reiterates Buy Call

2020-08-03,"On Monday, shares of Visa (NYSE: V) saw unusual options activity. After the option activity alert, the stock price moved up to $190.61.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-03-19  * Strike Price: $150.00  * Volume: 1019  * Open Interest: 11953 Ways Options Activity is 'Unusual'One way option activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are &quot;out of the money&quot; are also indicative of unusual option activity. &quot;Out of the money&quot; contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment   * Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price  * Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask priceThese observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish option activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * P/E Ratio Insights for Visa  * ROCE Insights For Visa  * Visa's Price Over Earnings Overview(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-13,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. is no stranger to causing sticker shock with its newest products. It’s about to find out whether it can create a similar reaction among U.S. corporate-bond buyers with its latest debt offering.The technology giant is taking the rare step of issuing dollar bonds for the second time in the same calendar year. When Apple borrowed $8.5 billion in May, the 10-year portion priced at a yield that was 110 basis points more than benchmark U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year part of the new deal is being marketed at a spread of 75 basis points and seems destined to tighten from there. The average yield spread on double-A corporate bonds has narrowed by more than 50 basis points since Apple’s last offering, Bloomberg Barclays index data show, suggesting the iPhone maker could lock in a 10-year rate around 1.25%. To put that in context: Before this year, the U.S. government itself had never borrowed so cheaply.At this point, few superlatives are left to describe the relentless rally in investment-grade bonds. As Bloomberg News’s Molly Smith reported, companies from Amazon.com Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. to Visa Inc. and Chevron Corp. have all set record-low interest rates across the corporate yield curve. Chevron’s two-year debt priced with a 0.333% coupon; Amazon’s three-year securities offered 0.4%; and Visa’s seven-year bonds offered 0.75%, outdoing Alphabet’s 0.8%.Apple’s all-in borrowing costs probably won’t be lower than those of Alphabet, which timed its deal perfectly and sold debt just before Treasury yields increased by the most in two months. But the fact that the iPhone maker is piling into a market already grappling with never-before-seen interest rates might be enough to start causing investors to bristle, particularly given the recent wave of encouraging economic data, such as U.S. initial jobless claims falling below 1 million for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic took hold. In theory, such a rebound would lead traders to rotate into riskier assets.Then again, it’s not as if investors are shunning equities or high-yield bonds. Junk-rated Ball Corp., an aluminum-packaging company, issued $1.3 billion of 10-year securities at 2.875% earlier this week, the lowest ever for a U.S. speculative-grade deal with a maturity that long. Meanwhile, like much of the technology sector, Apple’s stock price is almost 40% higher than it was in February. The company plans to use debt proceeds at least in part to buy back shares and pay dividends.The Federal Reserve is the elephant in the room, of course, even if Chair Jerome Powell has specifically said the central bank doesn’t intend to “run through the bond market like an elephant.” Its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility has bought $55 million in Apple debt across eight separate securities, according to a disclosure of purchases through July 29.(1) In the grand scheme of things, that’s not all that much, given that companies have sold almost $2 trillion of bonds and leveraged loans just this year. But the backstop effect matters just about as much as the actual amount it owns. As I wrote last month, given the company’s tendency to use the money it raises to conduct share buybacks, it’s not quite the Fed buoying Apple stock, but it’s awfully close.More important, the Fed’s facility creates the perception that there’s virtually no risk in holding investment-grade U.S. corporate bonds — it’s practically free money as long as it offers any sort of yield pickup relative to Treasuries. That’s why investment-grade bond funds have experienced consecutive weekly inflows over the past four months that collectively have exceeded $100 billion. Eight of the 10 largest inflows in history have have come during this streak:I was asked on Bloomberg Radio earlier this week if there was an asset class I thought had run too far, too fast. It’s a tough question for anyone when gold prices soared above $2,000 an ounce and the S&P 500 Index exceeded its record close in just 175 days. I flagged investment-grade corporate bonds simply because these type of one-way flows make me nervous, given their propensity to create both virtuous and vicious cycles. I see the arguments for why there’s more room to run — remarkably, average corporate-bond spreads are still 39 basis points wider than their tightest levels from the past decade — and wouldn’t necessarily bet on the credit rally fizzling out, let alone sharply reversing its gains. But at a certain point, investors in any asset class need to pause and take a breather. That process might not begin with Apple, but its bond sale is bound to splash yet another jarring interest rate across trading screens.(1) For those interested, the specific CUSIPs are: 037833DV9, 037833AR1, 037833AK6, 037833CG3, 037833CM0, 037833DL1, 037833DT4, 037833BS8.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-08-14,"David Tepper's fund Appaloosa took a number of new stakes in mostly communication services, technology an payment platforms over the past 45-day period, according to regulatory filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, known as 13Fs. Appaloosa acquired more than 9 million shares in AT&T  worth $274 million, but also picked up 840,000 shares of Visa Inc.  valued at $162.3 million, 545,000 shares of Mastercard  worth $161 million, and 870,000 shares of payments company PayPal Holdings , or $151.6 million. Tepper's fund also scooped up 1.2 million shares of Disney at $133 million and 1.9 million shares of food-services company Sysco Corp.  worth $102.5 million. Appaloosa also purchased 1.6 million shares of Altria Group Inc. for about $61 million, representing a new position in the tobacco company. Incidentally, while the 13F fillings for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway  was unloading more than a quarter of its position in Wells Fargo & Co. , Tepper boosted his position by more than 170%, buying 1.2 million shares of the San Francisco bank, representing 0.8% of Appaloosa's overall portfolio from 0.6%. The company also picked up 1.4 million shares of Emerson Electric Co. , worth $87 million, about 1.5% of the fund's portfolio. Large investors must disclose long stock positions held at the end of a quarter 45 days later in a 13F filing with the SEC, which means such filings are merely a snapshot of an investor holdings at a given point.","Tepper's Appaloosa loads up on new stakes in AT&T, Visa, PayPal, Disney, and Mastercard"

2020-08-21,"Since the equity markets hit a bottom in March, the bull run has been the strongest since the Great Depression, according to the Wall Street Journal. But sustaining this will not be easy. If anything, it's probably a good idea to consider safe stocks to buy for your portfolio.One of the risks for the markets is the upcoming election. With the novel coronavirus, there will be a much larger portion of the population that will vote by mail -- and this could easily delay the results. The uncertainty could mean a spike in volatility. In fact, this happened during the election in 2000.Next, there are signs of frothiness. Many tech stocks and IPOs have seen parabolic moves on the upside. Perhaps the most notable example of the exuberance is when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock jumped because of an announcement of a stock split. Keep in mind that this kind of market action was common during the later stages of the dot-com boom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd finally, there are signs that the economic recovery has stalled out. The lack of a stimulus agreement will also likely weigh on growth.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now OK then, in light of all this, what are some of the safe stocks to buy now? Well, here's a look at seven:  * Visa (NYSE:V)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Safe Stocks to Buy: Visa (V)Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Founded in 1958, Visa's future still looks bright. It certainly helps that the company has built a powerful platform with significant barriers to entry and network effects.It's true that the pandemic has weighed on the company. In the latest quarter, earnings dropped by 23% and payments volume was off by 10%. A big reason for this was the steep fall in travel activity. But keep in mind that Visa has been able to offset some of this through improvements in other parts of the business.For example, the volume of activity for card-not-present transactions -- such as for those online -- jumped by 25% each week since the start of April. This is a doubling of the growth rate compared to before the pandemic. For the first half of this year, Visa issued over than 80 million contactless cards in the U.S.In the meantime, the company has been paring back its expenses. This has been largely due to lower spending on advertising and marketing.Visa has also been investing aggressively in fintech technologies. Earlier in the year, the company shelled out $5.3 billion for Plaid, which is a top integration platform for connecting to third-party financial systems. And with V stock fetching a valuation of $450 billion and a hefty cash balance, there is plenty of resources to continue the deal-making. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com When it comes to safe stocks to buy, Coca-Cola has the essential factors. The company's moat includes over 500 strong brands and thousands of different products. There is also a massive distribution footprint in over 200 countries. Consider that Coca-Cola provides over 1.9 billion servings a day of its beverages.Although, the company has definitely not been immune from the impact of the pandemic. Of course, there has been a fall-off in business from restaurants, theaters and stadiums.But for the latest quarter, Coca-Cola's management did indicate that it appeared that the worst was over. There was also talk to accelerate the transformation efforts of the company, such as with increased investments in digital technology and even artificial intelligence.Another advantage of KO stock is the dividend. There has been an increase for 58 straight years. Safe Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com The healthcare industry definitely has many safe stocks to buy. The industry continues to grow and there are long-term secular trends like the aging of populations across the globe.One of the safest healthcare stocks is Johnson & Johnson, which has been around since 1886. The company's platform is massive and covers the main categories of healthcare:  * Consumer: These are personal, beauty, oral care and wound products. Some of the brands include Aveeno, Sudafed, Nicorette, Neutrogena, Listerine and Pepcid.  * Pharmaceuticals: They cover areas like immunology, infectious diseases, oncology and pulmonary hypertension.  * Medical Devices: The products are for surgery, eye health and orthopaedic procedures.Last month, JNJ started its first human clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine and the plan is to have a large Phase 3 trial in September. The company has invested in its infrastructure to be able to manufacture as much as 1 billion doses for next year.Something else: With relatively stable cash flows, JNJ stock has been a solid dividend payer, with the current yield at 2.7%. The company has increased its dividend payout for 57 consecutive years. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The tech sector has plenty of safe stocks to buy. But there's a problem: The valuations have gotten a bit excessive.Yet there are still some interesting value plays, such as Cisco Systems. The stock recent took a hit because of the delays in sales due to the pandemic.  But the result is that the valuation is much more reasonable, with the price-earnings ratio at 16x. The dividend on CSCO stock is also at 3.3%, which is one of the highest for the tech industry.Note that the company is taking swift action to reduce its cost structure. The goal is to realize savings of $1 billion. But Cisco is also looking at ways to increase its growth.To this end, the company expects to ramp up its research and development on cloud computing as well as security solutions. CSCO is also seeing a spike in interest in Webex, which is a leading video conferencing platform. According to Cisco CEO Charles Robbins: &quot;We expect this momentum to continue, as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions.&quot; Safe Stocks to Buy: Nike (NKE)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com In January, Nike appointed John Donahoe as CEO. Prior to this, he was the CEO of tech companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).Nike's move was another indication of why the company has been so successful -- that is, it is always looking for ways to innovate and be creative. And by selecting Donahoe, there was a clear sign that digital transformation would be critical for the future.And yes, Nike has already benefited from this expertise. When the coronavirus hit, Donahoe acted swiftly to bolster the company's e-commerce platform. The result has been that -- during the latest quarter -- there was a 75% spike in the business.True, there was still an overall drop in the sales. But the e-commerce sales did soften the blow. Besides, another key advantage for NKE stock is its highly valuable brand. Its icon swoosh is recognized across the globe and commands premium pricing. As Donahoe said on the latest earnings call: &quot;Nike's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers, amid a global shift toward health and wellness.&quot; McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com When Ray Kroc came on board McDonald's in 1954, he had big plans. He set out to transform the restaurant industry and be the leader in the emerging fast-food category. And it did not take him long to do this.Fast forward to today: McDonald's has over 36,000 locations across more than 100 countries.Building this empire has included a variety of innovative strategies, such as with creating an efficient process for cooking food, coming up with creative menu items and keeping costs low. But the company has also been smart with its business model, such as by relying on franchises.While the pandemic has depressed sales -- which has been the case throughout the restaurant industry -- MCD has been finding ways to deal with the challenges. The company has been able to quickly make operational changes to its chain of locations, say with safety measures, new menus and contactless systems. There has also been material improvements to the speed of service for the drive-thru business. During this period, customer satisfaction has actually increased.Then again, McDonald's has the benefit of a trusted brand as well as a rock-solid balance sheet. There is also an attractive dividend.

And even with the pandemic, the company has continued to grow its base. In the latest quarter, VZ added roughly 173,000 postpaid phone connections. Then again, for millions of people, their smartphone has become a necessity.But in the next few years, VZ should benefit from the megatrend of 5G. This technology will supercharge the speeds of mobile networks -- spurring the creation of innovative apps for consumers and businesses. Technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality and the internet of things will become more pervasive.To capitalize on this, VZ has recently acquired Blue Jeans Network, which operates a videoconferencing platform. Of course, this market has seen a surge in growth because of the pandemic. But 5G will be another important catalyst.VZ stock is currently trading at attractive levels as the price-earnings ratio is at 12.7x and the dividend is at 4%. The company also has a reasonable debt load and continues to crank out strong cash flows, which have come to nearly $16 billion for the past year.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

She has over 10% of her portfolio in these names so she is not interested in the other stocks in the space.She said that 85% of payments in the world are still made by cash or check and she believes that pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital payments and alternative payments.

2020-08-27,"In the past month, shares of Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) have gained 15.9%, more than double the 7.6% gain by competitor Visa Inc (NYSE: V) in that time.On Thursday, one Wall Street analyst said Mastercard's recent outperformance underscores the fact that Visa is the better investment at this point.The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Jason Kupferberg reiterated his Buy rating for Visa and raised his price target from $227 to $234. He also reiterated his Hold rating for Mastercard and raised his price target from $324 to $358.The Thesis: Kupferber said much of Mastercard's outperformance in recent weeks was likely driven by what was perceived to be better second-quarter earnings numbers. However, he said Mastercard management was clear on its earnings call that client incentives drove revenue upside largely due simply to timing. Management also mentioned timing as a primary factor in operating margin upside as well.After adjusting for the timing impacts, Kupferberg said Mastercard's quarter was essentially in-line with Visa's.Looking ahead to the second half of the year, Kupferberg said Visa is better-positioned to potentially report some meaningful earnings beats, and the stock also has more valuation upside given it currently trades at a 12% earnings multiple discount to Mastercard.Mastercard bulls may argue that the company's 13.5% US debit volume growth compares favorably to Visa's, at 8%, but Kupferberg said those numbers are a bit misleading given Mastercard's debit volume is only half the size of Visa's.&quot;Given current choppiness in consumer spending, we believe the higher mix of debit (which tends to be linked to more non-discretionary purchases) is a plus,&quot; Kupferberg said.Benzinga's Take: It's difficult to get a clear picture of the underlying trends for both Visa and Mastercard these days. Kupferberg said stimulus funds, including unemployment benefits in many states, created significant noise in both companies' second-quarter numbers.Related Links:Facebook Forms New Group To Rationalize Payments Across Apps Sarat Sethi Likes American Express See more from Benzinga  * Pending Home Sales Up 5.9% In July, Ahead Of Expectations  * Investors Cheer Powell's New 'Average Inflation Targeting' Policy  * 'No Obvious End In Sight': Experts React To Another 1 Million Weekly Jobless Claims(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-27,"Shares of Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) increased by 6.97% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Visa has.Visa's Debt According to the Visa's most recent financial statement as reported on July 31, 2020, total debt is at $20.88 billion, with $17.88 billion in long-term debt and $3.00 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $13.90 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $6.98 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Visa's $77.88 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Importance of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * A Look Into Visa's P/E Ratio  * Analyzing Visa's Unusual Option Activity  * P/E Ratio Insights for Visa(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

In Q2, Visa earned $3.92 billion, and total sales reached $5.85 billion.What Is ROCE? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Visa posted an ROCE of 0.08%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on VReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Visa, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight Visa reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.06/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.03/share.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For August 27, 2020  * A Look Into Visa's Debt(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-15,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. on Tuesday ended its longtime card partnership with Barclays Plc, a move designed to focus attention on its own Apple Card product-financing plans.Customers will no longer have the option to apply for the credit card in retail stores or via the company’s website starting Tuesday, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant told retail employees in a memo. Apple will be announcing its plans for two new Apple Watch models and a new iPad Air on Tuesday. Apple told staff that existing cardholders can keeping using the card as a normal credit card.The Barclaycard Financing Visa deal allowed customers to purchase Apple products at no interest for different amounts of time depending on how much they spent. For example, if a user spent less than $499 on an Apple purchase, they would get six months of no interest payments. If they spent more than $999, they would get the deal for 18 months.A Barclays representative didn’t have any immediate comment, and Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Barclays counts airlines such as JetBlue Airways Corp. and American Airlines Group Inc. among its biggest U.S. partners. The bank has seen spending on its cards slow as consumers abandoned travel plans during the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this summer, the bank also temporarily stopped taking new applications for its co-brand credit card with Uber Technologies Inc.For Apple’s part, it will instead point users to its recently launched Apple Card Monthly Installments plan, which lets Apple Card holders in the U.S. avoid interest payments for six, 12 or 24 months, depending on which Apple device is purchased.Apple chose Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as its bank partner to launch the Apple Card in the U.S. in August 2019, and the partnership with Barclays started winding down then.

2020-09-21,"The pandemic-led lockdowns and social distancing restrictions hurt spending on several discretionary goods, travel, entertainment and fuel, thus impacting payment network giants Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. However, these companies are experiencing improved metrics with the easing of lockdowns.Moreover, the pandemic has created an opportunity for payment networks due to a surge in e-commerce and the preference for contactless payment options. Last month, Mastercard revealed the results of its survey of small businesses across North America and said that 76% of these companies indicated that the pandemic prompted them to become more digital with 82% changing how they send and receive payments.The TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool will help us place Mastercard and Visa alongside each other and see which of these leading payment companies offers a better investment opportunity.Mastercard (MA)Leading financial services company Mastercard has a presence in over 210 countries and serves customers through 2.2 billion Mastercard branded cards and 417 million Maestro cards. COVID-19’s impact on consumer spending reflected in the company’s 2Q revenue, which declined 19% Y/Y to $3.3 billion and led to a 28% decline in adjusted EPS to $1.36.However, one positive aspect in the second quarter was the 12% rise in other revenues to $1.1 billion due to growth in the company’s Cyber and Intelligence as well as Data and Services solutions.As per Mastercard’s 3Q business update, the company is experiencing continued moderate improvements. Notably, switched transactions (reflects the number of transactions initiated, authorized,  cleared and settled through Mastercard network), grew 5% in the week ending August 28 compared to 3% in the week ending July 21. Cross-border volume was down 35% in the week ending August 28 compared to a 40% decline in the week ending July 21.Meanwhile, the company continues to pursue opportunities in priority areas such as open banking, real-time payments, cyber and intelligence Solutions and B2B themes. In June, Mastercard announced an agreement to acquire Finicity, a leading provider of real-time access to financial data and insights, to bolster its open banking platform.Last month, Mastercard expanded its partnership with TransferWise to allow the issuance of cards in any country where Mastercard is accepted and TransferWise is licensed. Mastercard is also enabling checkout-free shopping through the rollout of its Shop Anywhere platform with several retailers from October.Aside from Shop Anywhere, another frictionless solution that that company introduced is the AI Powered Drive Through platform, provided in partnership with SoundHound Inc. and Rekor Systems. This new platform will help fast-food and quick-serve restaurant brands speed up a drive-thru or drive-in interaction through vehicle recognition, voice ordering, and artificial intelligence.Mastercard has also accelerated its Crypto Card Partner Program and has granted Wirex a principal membership license, making it the first native cryptocurrency platform to issue Mastercard payment cards. (See MA stock analysis on TipRanks)On Sept. 11, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a Buy rating for Mastercard, stating “Near term COVID-19 pandemic-driven weakness will be overcome by an acceleration in electronic payment and service adoption, which will drive further acceleration in Business Performance trends.”The Street is also bullish about Mastercard and has a Strong Buy consensus based on 22 Buys, 5 Holds and no Sell ratings. The stock has risen 12% so far this year and a possible upside of 6.8% lies ahead based on the average analyst price target of $358.Visa (V)Visa, the global payments industry leader with a vast presence in over 200 countries, could not escape the COVID-19 led weakness in transactions and posted a 17% decline in its revenue of $4.8 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which ended June 30. Adjusted EPS fell 23% Y/Y to $1.06.Earlier this month, Visa reported a 7% Y/Y rise in its August US payments volume which was slower than the 8% growth in July, reflecting the impact of the expiration of the elevated unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, global processed transactions grew 3% in August compared to a 1% growth in July due to accelerating domestic transactions triggered by the easing of social distancing restrictions. Cross-border volume (excluding intra-Europe transactions) was down 43% in August compared to a 44% fall in July.Meanwhile, Visa is capturing the demand for contactless payments amid the COVID outbreak through its tap-to-pay solutions. In the US alone, Visa added over 80 million contactless cards in the first six months of this year. It expects tap-to-pay to accelerate post-COVID when consumers start going back to the office and conduct smaller transactions for their commute, pay transit fares, and buy food and drinks.Also, the rapid shift to e-commerce works well for Visa as its share of digital commerce is about three times greater than the physical point of sale.The company has been entering into strategic partnerships to expand in key growth areas. It has partnered with UK-based fintech Conferma Pay to integrate Visa virtual cards in the Conferma Pay mobile app. The collaboration will allow companies to provision virtual Visa commercial cards to employees' digital wallets, enabling tap-to-pay and simplify expense reimbursement.In January, Visa announced a $5.3 billion agreement to acquire fintech Plaid, which has products that enable consumers to share their financial information with many apps and services such as Acorns, Betterment, Chime, Transferwise and Venmo. Visa expects to complete this deal by the year-end.To capitalize on the accelerated shift to digital payments amid the pandemic, Visa recently extended its global partnership with PayPal. The expanded partnership will enable consumers and small businesses to move their money faster through PayPal and Visa Direct capabilities. (See V stock analysis on TipRanks)Last month, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev initiated coverage of Visa with a Buy rating and a price target of $250. The analyst believes that card penetration is the key driver of Visa's volume growth, and channel work points to accelerating card penetration and a boost to US volume growth. He also believes that the long-term stability of the company's &quot;best-in-class&quot; terminal margins should merit mid-teens revenue multiples.Likewise, the Street is bullish about Visa with 16 Buys, 2 Holds and no Sell ratings adding to a Strong Buy consensus. The stock has risen about 8% year-to-date and the average analyst price target of $222.33 reflects an upside potential of 10% in the coming months.The better financial playBoth Mastercard and Visa have strong business models that stand to benefit in the digital world. They are on the path to recovery as economies are reopening- though COVID-related impact on travel and other businesses continues to be a major drag on cross-border volumes.Mastercard has a dividend yield of 0.48% compared to Visa’s yield of 0.59%. Moreover, a lower valuation multiple and higher upside potential ahead as indicated by the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool make Visa a more attractive investment currently.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-09-21,"Over the past three months, shares of Visa (NYSE: V) moved higher by 2.48%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Visa has.Visa's Debt Based on Visa's financial statement as of July 31, 2020, long-term debt is at $17.88 billion and current debt is at $3.00 billion, amounting to $20.88 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $13.90 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $6.98 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Visa has $77.88 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Looking Into Visa's Return On Capital Employed  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Friday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-23,"Visa (NYSE: V) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved down to $200.03 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-10-16  * Strike Price: $192.50  * Volume: 0  * Open Interest: 94Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Visa's Debt Overview  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Looking Into Visa's Return On Capital Employed(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-27,"The coming Ant Group IPO is the most anticipated of the year, but as with all things between China and the U.S., there are many investor questions lingering about how to buy the Ant Group IPO.Source: Shutterstock The company, formed by Jack Ma to handle transactions at Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA), is less a bank or a payments company than a software as a service outfit.That means it's more like Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) than JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). The market value of Ant Group stock after the IPO is likely to be just over half as big as Visa (NYSE:V), which is worth $416 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe problem is that because of the Trump Administration's Cold War with China, Ant isn't listing in the U.S. The Administration is trying to use executive orders to force American investors out of all Chinese stocks.But that doesn't mean you can't still get in. Read the IPO document first, then call your broker. Alibaba is a Proxy for Ant Group IPOThe easiest way to get into Ant is to buy Alibaba stock.Alibaba owns about one-third of Ant. If Ant's valuation after the IPO is $225 billion, as expected, Alibaba's stake is worth $67 billion.  * 7 Sin Stocks To Buy That Will Outperform the S&P 500 Alibaba recently passed Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to become the fifth most-valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of $729 billion. Some of that recent rise, 27% so far in 2020, is fueled by its stake in Ant. I have been urging investors buy Alibaba for years and have some shares in my retirement account. Buy Renaissance InternationalAnother way to buy into Ant is through the Renaissance Financial IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPOS).This is an exchange-traded fund run by Renaissance Capital, which specializes in IPOs. As more than half of IPOS portfolio is in Chinese stocks, Ant stock will undoubtedly find its way there. So far in 2020, IPOS is up about 30%. Buy a Chinese FundRenaissance isn't the only fund that's going to get into Ant Financial.Other China-oriented funds like the SPDR S&P China ETF (NYSEARCA:GXC) and the iShares MSCI China ETF (NASDAQ:MCHI) are certain to get shares as well. The SPDR funds are run by S&P Global (NASDAQ:SPGI), iShares by Blackrock (NYSE:BLK).So far in 2020, GXC is up about 15% while MCHI is up about 8%. Call Your BrokerInteractive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR), Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW) all offer some Chinese trading services. Interactive Brokers trades on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges, Schwab just in Hong Kong.Unless you're an extra-large client at one of these brokers, it's unlikely you can get IPO shares, but you can still trade after the offering. I have been with Schwab for years. I call Charlie my bookie. Wait for the ADRBanks and brokers create and market American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on many foreign stocks, including some without U.S. listings.After Ant goes public, it's likely a sponsor will turn up to handle ADR trading. Technically I don't own any Alibaba. I own some ADRs. These range in quality, from companies that offer few financial details to those that offer regular reports. Ant will fall in the latter group. Buy the Big BanksA final way to get a taste of Ant is through the big U.S. banks that are sponsoring the Hong Kong listing. These include JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Citigroup (NYSE:C). Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has also joined the syndicate recently.The IPO will be a major payday for these banks. This year, the brokerage side of these banks are providing the profits, because rates of return on lending are so low. The Bottom LineIn addition to financial risks, buying Ant also carries geopolitical risks. If Trump is re-elected in November, the Administration may shut the door entirely on China. (They can have my Alibaba when they pry it from my cold, dead hands.) Even if Joe Biden is elected, the China relationship is going to be fraught.If you're willing to take those risks, as well as the financial ones, go for it.At the time of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held a long position in BABA.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial journalist since 1978.

2020-10-08,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration’s potential restrictions on two Chinese payments giants would reverberate far beyond politics, potentially affecting multibillion-dollar deals, shaking up international commerce and even shaping the evolution of the global financial system.U.S. officials have stepped up behind-the-scenes talks in recent weeks about possibly restricting the expansion of Ant Group’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay over concerns that the digital-payment platforms threaten national security, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.If the administration proceeds, the most immediate hit would be to Ant Group’s plan for a stock listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong, a deal that could rank as the world’s largest initial public offering. Some international companies have been working with the payment apps and could see those strategies hurt or derailed. And while restrictions may ultimately head off potent competitors to U.S. and European banks, it could also -- depending on how China responds -- thwart their own planned expansion into the world’s second-largest economy.Here’s a breakdown of the many companies with business at stake as President Donald Trump’s administration weighs its decision:Ant’s IPOInvestors have been eager to pile into Jack Ma’s Ant Group. After gauging early interest, the company is seeking to raise at least $35 billion in its IPO, people familiar with the matter have said, potentially topping Saudi Aramco’s record $29 billion sale. Ant lifted the target based on an increased valuation of about $250 billion, which would exceed the market capitalization of Bank of America Corp., the second-largest U.S. lender.Restricting Alipay would cast a pall over the sale. It’s unclear whether U.S. investors would be allowed to buy shares. American funds including Silver Lake Management LLC, Warburg Pincus LLC, and Carlyle Group Inc. already put at least $500 million in the fintech giant in 2018. The sanction also could give pause to non-U.S. funds such as Singapore state investors Temasek Holdings Pte and GIC Pte. -- existing backers that could boost their stakes in the IPO.Ant Group generates the vast majority of its revenue in China. But the Trump administration’s deliberations may at least prompt investors to recalibrate expectations for the payment apps’ international growth.The prospect of someday offering services to U.S. consumers “is a huge shot of adrenaline to the heart of the business,” said David Menlow, president and founder of IPOFinancial.com. Now, investors “will be thinking twice.”U.S. banks Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are working as sponsors for the IPO in Hong Kong -- which alone could raise about $17.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s unclear how U.S. restrictions would affect the investment banks’ hard-fought relationship with Ant.Global PaymentsFor U.S. officials, the concern is that the growing popularity of Alipay and WeChat Pay internationally gives China unprecedented access to banking and transaction data that could ultimately include personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans. The question is whether authorities in China might raise similar concerns about U.S. firms.Initially, Alipay’s foray into the U.S. focused on places where Chinese consumers visit and shop, such as luxury stores in New York or tourist destinations in California. But last year, things began accelerating as Alipay inked deals with retailers like drugstore chain Walgreens, placing the app’s logo in front of millions more U.S. consumers.At the same time, U.S. payment networks have been pushing into China. In November, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. announced deals allowing their cards to be added to the WeChat Pay and Alipay wallets -- making it easier for cardholders from outside China to shop on the mainland, where the apps already dominate all forms of commerce.“We will look at any partnerships that we need to according to whatever regulations are in place,” Ann Cairns, Mastercard’s vice chairman, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Our strategy, though, is to have an open system and to work with as many players as we can around the world.”The card networks have longed to expand into China. “I couldn’t be more excited,” Visa Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly told investors in May. There was more progress recently, with American Express Co. getting approval in June to start bank-card clearing services in China.Now, any actions against Alipay or WeChat Pay could spell trouble for the U.S. networks’ ambitions.Investment BanksFor U.S. banks, the news comes with upsides and downsides. American bankers have long feared domestic consumers would one day embrace Chinese-style payment apps, which seamlessly allow people to shop, order takeout, pay bills and manage brokerage accounts using mobile phones. A variety of banks and technology companies have tried and failed to gain the kind of dominance allowing them to head off outside competition.On the other hand, U.S. banks have been eyeing China as fertile ground for revenue growth.Wall Street giants such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan have waited for decades to move into the nation’s $45 trillion financial market. Five top U.S. banks had roughly $70 billion of combined exposure to China in 2019. But even that’s small compared to their ambitions for expansion there.JPMorgan’s joint venture in the region has begun offering brokerage services, investment advisory and underwriting businesses. Goldman has said it wants to take full ownership of its joint venture in China. It hopes to double its workforce in the country as it ramps up asset- and wealth-management offerings.If financial-services firms are dragged into a tit-for-tat between the two countries, it could complicate such strategies and threaten the relationships they have spent years trying to build with giant Chinese companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns a one-third stake in Ant.U.S. PartnershipsBrands including Marriott hotels and KFC restaurants in China use Ant’s Alipay superapp, building their own lite apps that can help users book rooms and order food. Asset manager Vanguard Group set up a joint venture with Ant to provide automated financial-advisory services in China. The robo adviser lured more than 100,000 people in the country as of June. Ant is also working with the joint ventures of mutual fund operators such as Invesco Ltd.Still, the Trump administration’s guideline for Tencent’s instant-messaging app WeChat could offer clues to how the U.S. might handle payment platforms. It has allowed U.S. companies to continue working with WeChat outside of the U.S. Alibaba’s shares reflected optimism that Ant’s business would remain mostly insulated, rising 1.4% in the U.S. and trading little changed in Hong Kong.(Updates with Mastercard interview in 13th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",White House Curbs on Chinese Payment Apps Pose Risk to Ant

2020-10-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The visa program for skilled workers is a net positive for American society despite a number of problems that make it a target of critics who worry that cheap foreign workers are taking Americans’ jobs and lowering wages.Fortunately, the country may already be on the way to fixing those problems. The first step, an increase in the minimum wage for H-1B visa holders, has just happened.The H-1B program is often discussed as a way to alleviate labor shortages: Import foreign specialists to do work that native-born Americans are unavailable to do. That's how advocates often sell the program, and it fits the common idea of jobs as a fixed resource to be parceled out. In fact, helping companies “who cannot otherwise obtain needed business skills and abilities from the U.S. workforce” is right there in the program’s mission statement.But in reality, relieving shortages has little to do with the H-1B program’s true economic purpose. H-1B visas expand the available pool of skilled workers in the country, which makes the U.S. a more attractive place for high-value industries to locate. Without the ability to hire talented foreigners on American soil, tech companies will take their offices to Asia, Europe, or elsewhere. The total number of high-paying tech jobs in the U.S. will then shrink.That’s why it makes no sense to talk about “shortages” of skilled workers; the more of them the U.S. takes in, the more the number of jobs will grow. And that’s why a number of studies find that allowing in more H-1B workers actually increases job opportunities and wages for native-born workers of all education levels. H-1B workers also produce lots of innovation, which helps maintain U.S. technological leadership over rivals like China.There's still basically two problems with the H-1B program. The first is that the visas often go to workers who don’t really help grow the U.S. tech-industry. The program is dominated by outsourcing and consulting firms, which generally do lower-value work, pay lower wages, and don’t produce innovation themselves. In 2019, six of the top 10 companies getting H-1B approvals were outsourcing or consulting firms.Allowing outsourcing and consulting firms to hire cheap foreign labor in the U.S. is not a bad thing. It results in some increased investment, and those foreign workers spend their money locally, which boosts local economies. But it’s far from an optimal use of the H-1B program, and it crowds out far more innovative companies and higher-value workers.The easiest way of addressing this problem would be to simply raise the cap on the total number of H-1Bs, from the current level of 85,000 to the 195,000 that prevailed in the early 2000s. In addition, it makes sense to raise the minimum salary that employers are required to pay H-1B workers. In a world where super-high-value workers are clamoring to enter the U.S., requiring higher wages means that lower-productivity outsourcing and consulting workers will be replaced with higher-value engineers and researchers.The U.S. Labor Department has just done this, implementing a 30% increase in the required salary for H-1B workers. This effectively eliminates the lowest-skill tier of H-1B jobs, and will mean more spots available for the higher tiers. That will raise the program’s productivity and innovation output, and potentially quiet populist fears that H-1Bs represent low-paid replacements for U.S. workers.Unfortunately, the Trump administration, which probably sees the move as advancing its general assault on skilled immigration, is unlikely to take the additional step of raising the H-1B cap. But a Joe Biden administration might.Raising the minimum salary is only a start. The H-1B program has another well-known problem, which is that some H-1B workers have difficulty changing employers. Many visa holders use the program as a springboard to an employer-sponsored green card. But while they’re in the process of applying for permanent residency, workers have a tough time switching companies, since that would threaten to delay or even jeopardize their green card application. This so-called tethering effect means that some H-1B workers have very little leverage to bargain for higher wages, which fuels the fear that they represent cheap foreign replacements.The solution, as leading immigration economist William Kerr has written, is to allow H-1B workers to sponsor themselves for green cards, instead of relying on their companies to do so. That would allow them to change jobs easily even while in the middle of an application, and increase their ability to demand competitive wages. An additional measure would be to allow state and local governments to sponsor H-1B workers’ green card applications.Overall, the H-1B program is a boon to the U.S. and to native-born American workers. It certainly doesn’t deserve the fear and animosity that it sometimes receives. But by raising minimum salaries and allowing visa holders to sponsor themselves for green cards, the program can be made even more beneficial, while reassuring some of the critics that smart, hard-working foreigners are here to help Americans instead of steal their jobs.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-10-19,"Visa Inc. has made a strategic investment in UK payments issuer processor Global Processing Services (GPS). Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.Visa’s (V) strategic investment is intended to boost GPS’ global expansion, following its launch of new and innovative fintechs and digital banks in Europe and South East Asia, including Revolut and Starling Bank. As an issuer processor GPS supports fintechs, digital banks and e-wallet providers on their growth journey. Following the investment, GPS, which is also backed by UK growth private equity firm, Dunedin, will be one of Visa’s preferred processors globally.“GPS is an example of how we continue to invest in, and partner with, companies that provide valuable capabilities to the ecosystem and have potential to advance the payments industry,” said Kevin Jacques at Visa Ventures. “The business has a strong balance sheet, engaging leadership and growth across key regions, and we believe it will continue to be an important enabler for payments processing.”GPS is certified by Visa and Mastercard to process and manage any credit, debit or prepaid card transaction globally. Visa is a global payments industry leader with a vast presence in over 200 countries.In recent months, Visa has been entering into strategic partnerships to expand in key growth areas. It has partnered with UK-based fintech Conferma Pay to integrate Visa virtual cards in the Conferma Pay mobile app. The collaboration will allow companies to provide virtual Visa commercial cards to employees' digital wallets, enabling tap-to-pay and simplify expense reimbursement. In January, Visa announced a $5.3 billion agreement to acquire fintech Plaid, which has products that enable consumers to share their financial information with many apps and services such as Acorns, Betterment, Chime, Transferwise and Venmo.Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev this month reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and his Street High $250 price target (25% upside potential), saying that a travel comeback in 2021 could boost EPS by as much as 10%.“Although exact timing is unpredictable, our proprietary online travel agency tracker may offer a silver lining, pointing to a modest positive inflection in search trends for prominent travel websites in late September & early October,” Dolev wrote in a note to investors. “Assuming 25-75% of lost 2020 travel volume returns in 2021, this could translate into approximately 5-10% further EPS growth for Visa.” (See V stock analysis on TipRanks)The rest of Street has a bullish outlook on the stock.

2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Newly announced reforms to the H-1B immigrant visa system have the potential to reduce the number of foreign workers allowed into the U.S., just as the Donald Trump administration intends. The problem is that goal makes no sense. If implemented, the changes will seriously harm many businesses — small firms and health-care providers especially. Overall, they’ll harm U.S. workers, not help them.Trump has already modified the H-1B program, which brings 85,000 skilled workers to the U.S. a year, but the new rules go further. The policy tightens the definition of “specialty” occupations that qualify for H-1B status and prevents companies from hiring foreign workers unless they have degrees that precisely match available job postings — making it impossible to hire a worker with an engineering degree as a software programmer, for instance.To prevent businesses from undercutting wages, the government will also require employers to increase the salaries of H-1B visa holders. The highest-skilled immigrants will have to be paid at the 95th percentile of the prevailing wage for their occupations, up from the 67th percentile under current rules. And visas for workers hired by information-technology placement firms will be limited to one year, a change affecting tens of thousands of people, mostly from India. The administration expects the changes to reduce demand for H-1B visas by one-third and sees this as a triumph for U.S. workers. In fact, it’s a defeat. Nearly two-thirds of H-1B recipients work in “computer-related” fields, where labor is in short supply. The third-quarter unemployment rate for programmers was 2.9%, compared to 8.8% for all U.S. workers, and vacancies in the sector are up 4.7% since April. These jobs increase consumer demand and help companies expand by filling critical roles. In other words, skilled immigrants spur growth and help create jobs for American workers.The new rules will discourage innovation and entrepreneurship by making the cost of employing foreign talent prohibitive for small businesses. U.S.-based startups that rely on skilled immigrants for IT services will outsource more tasks to workers outside the U.S. And, in the midst of a pandemic, the changes will worsen shortages of health-care workers. The new policy requires all medical professionals on H-1B visas to be paid at least $208,000, regardless of specialty or experience. For many clinics and hospitals in underserved areas, that’s unaffordable.Normally, public review might have allowed these defects to be exposed and remedied before the rules took effect. Not this time. The Office of Management and Budget issued waivers allowing the departments of Labor and Homeland Security to move forward without completing the usual review process. At a minimum, the courts should suspend the new rules until they’ve received public comment. Congressional leaders should also insist on closer scrutiny and remind the administration that far-reaching changes to immigration laws should be carried out through legislation, not executive fiat.The most important point is the simplest: The strongest possible U.S. economic recovery requires more talent drawn from the rest of the world, not less. A smart immigration system would recognize this fact, and in that way advance the interests of all Americans.Editorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.

2020-10-29,"Visa Inc (NYSE: V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) earnings on Wednesday failed to impress, as the American shopper held back from spending in the middle of the pandemic, the Financial Times reports.Both Visa and Mastercard reported a year-over-year revenue decline -- at 16.9% and 14.10%, respectively.What Happened: Total retail spending excluding petrol in the September quarter remained in the low growth mode, rising 1.8% YoY, according to Mastercard.Total domestic spending on Mastercard and Visa network grew 4% and 7.5%, respectively -- unchanged since summer.Moffett Nathanson payments analyst Lisa Ellis said that total spending volumes were weaker than expected but called Visa's earnings better than Mastercard. The former has more exposure to the U.S. and debit cards, FT reports.The revenue declines for both companies resulted from a lack of higher fees for cross-border transactions, as global travel remains limited.View more earnings on VMastercard reported a 36% YoY drop in cross-border transactions while Visa reported a 29% YoY decline.Wolfe Research analyst Darrin Peller had anticipated stronger earnings from both companies considering the pandemic-driven rise in electronic transactions.

Why It Matters: Mastercard Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra ties the return of cross-border transactions to vaccines and therapeutics' availability.Mehra remarked on the company conference call that personal travel will bounce back faster than business travel.According to Mastercard President Michael Miebach, contactless payments are growing in popularity with 41% penetration of in-person purchase transactions.Miebach expects e-commerce spending to remain elevated from pre-pandemic levels due to altering consumer payment behavior, reports the Wall Street Journal.V, MA Price Action: Visa shares declined 4.8% to $180.87, and MA shares fell 8.11% to $291.38 on Wednesday's close.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * European Markets Today: Stocks Hit Lows On Rising Coronavirus Fears  * China EVs Are Catching Up With Tesla(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-29,"Shares of Visa (NYSE: V) fell by 6.91% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Visa has.Visa's Debt Based on Visa's financial statement as of July 31, 2020, long-term debt is at $17.88 billion and current debt is at $3.00 billion, amounting to $20.88 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $13.90 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $6.98 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Visa has $77.88 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-10-29,"Visa Inc.’s 4Q revenues fell 17% to $5.1 billion year-over-year dragged down by the decline in cross-border volumes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, revenues of the global payments technology company came ahead of analysts’ estimates of $5 billion.Visa’s (V) total cross-border payment volume plunged 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The company’s prior-quarter payments volumes, on which 4Q service revenue is recognized, fell 10% on constant currency. Total processed transactions increased by 3% year-over-year.The company’s 4Q adjusted EPS decreased by 23% to $1.12 year-on-year but surpassed the Street consensus of $1.10. (See V stock analysis on TipRanks).Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. said, “While our business drivers and financial results were impacted by COVID-19 in 2020, we’ve made significant progress in advancing our growth strategy.” He further noted, “As the world turns increasingly to digital payments, we see tremendous opportunity for growth. We’ll remain thoughtful in our investments as we advance our strategy to enable the movement of money for everyone, everywhere.”Visa did not provide an outlook for fiscal 2021 citing continued global economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Following the earnings release, Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $250 (31.5% upside potential). In a note to investors, Dolev wrote, “Our work points to accelerating card penetration and a boost to US volume growth. We believe the long-term stability and V's best-in-class terminal margins (along with MA [Mastercard]) should merit a mid-teens revenue multiple.”Currently, the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock. The Strong Buy analyst consensus is based on 13 Buys and 2 Holds. With shares down nearly 4% year-to-date, the average price target of $227.53 implies upside potential of about 25.8% to current levels.Related News:   Fiverr Surges In Pre-Market On Earnings, Revenue Beat   Microsoft Down After-Hours Despite Very Strong Earnings Beat   Shopify Inks Social Commerce Partnership With TikTok More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Teladoc Sinks In Pre-Market Despite Strong Top Line Trends   * Gilead Cuts 2020 Guidance As Remdesivir Sales Disappoint   * Amgen's 3Q Top Line Gains 12% Fueled By Strong Drug Sales   * UPS Beats Q3 Estimates; Shares Plunge 9% On Margin Concerns",Visa 4Q Sales Sink 17% As Travel Freeze Hurts Payment Volumes

Indeed COVID-19 has upended much in 2020, resulting in the deaths of more than 200,000 Americans and sending the economy into a deep recession -- with millions of Americans unemployed. Because of the health scare, many voters have elected to vote by mail. This adds uncertainty to the counting, and may delay the ultimate decision. We took a close look at fourth quarters since 1980 and found that 4Qs typically do well for investors, whether a Democrat or Republican is living in the White House. The one time the election was contested during this period was in 1980. Investors did not like that process, which was resolved by the Supreme Court, and the S&P 500 fell 8% during the quarter. Stocks have pulled back in recent trading sessions as Election Day has approached. This has reduced some of the valuation pressure that had been building earlier, as equity prices soared while corporate earnings stumbled. All the same, we would expect a contested election this year to result in another negative performance for stocks.",Daily Spotlight: Potential Contested Election a Risk

2020-11-05,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the key themes in the antitrust proceedings against Big Tech this year centers on the idea that the U.S. was too shortsighted in allowing the biggest technology companies to maintain their monopoly power by swallowing up emerging competitors and absorbing their technology. On Thursday, regulators signaled that they are determined not to make that mistake again, at least when it comes to Visa Inc.’s $5.3 billion planned purchase of Plaid Inc.The Department of Justice’s antitrust division filed a lawsuit against Visa to block its takeover of the fintech startup, contending the deal would “eliminate a nascent competitive threat” to the payment giant’s business and allow it to preserve its monopoly position in the debit-card market. Visa, in a press release, said the suit is “legally flawed” and reflects a “lack of understanding” of Plaid’s business. The company emphasized the startup is not a payments company but a data firm that allows consumers to access their financial information from other third-party apps.Visa is not wrong in its current description of Plaid. The startup doesn’t have a payments offering today and is primarily a data-focused operation. Plaid basically does the technical plumbing, connecting app developers and financial institutions. But the government is taking a longer-term view on what Plaid may be able to do in the future. The DOJ’s stance seems plainly informed by last month’s U.S. House antitrust subcommittee report, which implied the Federal Trade Commission didn’t think far enough ahead in allowing Facebook Inc. to buy Instagram for $1 billion eight years ago. Back then, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was able to see the potential of the plucky photo-sharing startup before it became the social media powerhouse it is today. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, the government has been widely criticized for not seeing what was possible with Instagram’s 30 million user base at the time.Visa-Plaid fits the same playbook as Facebook-Instagram. Like Facebook with social media, Visa clearly dominates the payment and debit-card markets. In its latest fiscal year, the company said its network conducted more than 185 billion transactions and $9 trillion in payment volume, along with acceptance at nearly 70 million merchant locations.And like Instagram in photo sharing eight years ago, Plaid has reached a level of scale and traction in the market that will be difficult to replicate. The startup already provides connections for more than 11,000 banks, 200 million consumer bank accounts and 2,600 apps. In a January presentation, Visa said Plaid was a “best-in-class” platform with 80% share in working with the largest U.S. financial-technology apps. Stopping Visa from buying an emerging upstart that in time will likely be a strong rival in the online payment business is a good move for markets and competition. It’s thinking ahead. As hockey legend Wayne Gretsky says, “Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.” Gretsky would be proud.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore is rolling out the red carpet for top talent, launching a program to initially attract 500 individuals with a proven track record of contributing to the global technology ecosystem.Under the so-called Tech.Pass program, qualified individuals will be able to secure a new type of visa allowing them to start and operate more than one company and become an investor, consultant or mentor for local startups, according to the Economic Development Board. This offers more flexibility than current government regulations, which require companies to sponsor an employment pass for talent they want to bring in.The two-year visa isn’t designed for mid-tier tech workers who might compete with locals for jobs, a political issue that has prompted the government to tighten its framework for issuing employment passes to foreigners this year. It’s targeted at highly accomplished entrepreneurs and technical experts who can bring in capital, networks and knowhow, as Singapore aims to become the region’s technology and innovation hub.“Tech.Pass will add to the critical mass of established tech talent in Singapore and create a ‘flywheel effect’ to further strengthen our position as a leading tech hub for the region,” Minister of Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said in his opening remarks at the closed-door dialogue with the European Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.Candidates must meet two of the three requirements before they can apply for the program starting in January. They must have last drawn a monthly salary of at least S$20,000 ($14,800); have at least five years of experience in leading a tech company with a valuation or market value of at least $500 million; or have at least five years of experience in developing a tech product that has at least 100,000 monthly active users or at least $100 million of revenue.Singapore Tightens Restrictions for Foreign-Worker Passes Singaporeans Mainly Unconcerned With Foreign Workers, Poll ShowsThe Expat Model Is Breaking Down in Singapore: Daniel MossFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Singapore to Introduce New Visa to Draw Top Global Tech Talent

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Now that Asia has stitched together the world’s biggest trading bloc, U.S. financial and tech firms ought to be more than a little worried. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, will bind the 10 economies of Southeast Asia with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, creating a prototype of what my colleague David Fickling describes as “a sort of Pax Sinica,” a Beijing-led global order.To provide a counterweight, the U.S. needs the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Donald Trump backed out four years ago.(1) Japan is keen for Joe Biden, as the next president, to reverse the exit. But the goal of a U.S. pivot to Asia can’t solely be to encircle China. The objective must be to establish rules for ownership and use of Asian consumers’ financial and e-commerce data, a commodity that is set to become more valuable in this century than perhaps even oil was in the last. The main risk to U.S. firms from Washington’s isolationism isn’t trade. Both as the world’s consumer of last resort and provider of the currency in which most things are bought and sold, the U.S. might retain enough leverage on global commerce. It can offer bilateral deals to important trading partners who’ll jump at the chance of getting easier access to the American market. But multilateral agreements like TPP are useful for establishing standards. That’s important when those are sorely lacking, which is the case for data, the raw material that consumers in Asia provide for free to the likes of Visa Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc., as well as to Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Take the agreement on financial services in the new trade deal. It says that signatory nations will not prevent “transfers of data by electronic or other means, necessary for the conduct of the ordinary business of a financial service supplier in its territory.” However, in the two subsequent paragraphs, we learn that countries can still insist on local copies of records. They can also restrict cross-border transfers that flout their regulations on “personal data, personal privacy, and the confidentiality of individual records.” Ditto for electronic commerce: There are rules, but with broad escape hatches. A shopping website can freely send data overseas, and it won’t be required to maintain servers in the countries where it’s doing business. All of that can change if there’s a “legitimate public policy objective” or an “essential security interest.” If that wasn’t vague enough, e-commerce will only be brought under the RCEP’s proposed dispute settlement mechanism after a review. It’s a formula for endless delay, and even then, will only apply to countries that accept external adjudication. Anti-free-trade groups like bilaterals.org have noted that TPP’s stricter digital trade rules would have won more ironclad  guarantees for dominant tech companies. The RCEP has put a brake on that by tilting power back toward governments.But from a globalization perspective, this is America’s retreat from its historic standards-setting role in everything from accounting to food safety, a development that worries scholars like Evan Feigenbuam at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Silicon Valley firms should also be nervous. Their business model is to sell access to processed information — and its predictive power — again and again.As Columbia Law School professor Katharina Pistor argues in her paper, “Rule by Data: The End of Markets?”, Big Tech treats raw information as “wild animals: things that belong to no one but can be claimed by whoever catches them first.” This lawlessness can’t last. Governments are threatening to wield the stick, at least against the more egregious use of market power that comes from owning data. The European Union is investigating whether Amazon uses sales records of independent sellers to give an unfair advantage to its own retail arm. Potential fines can be as high as 10% of annual sales.Being in the driving seat of an accord like the TPP means that the U.S. can help write the rules. The diplomatic goal would be to strike a bargain: force U.S. tech and financial services firms to share a part of their supersize profit from algorithms with consumers both at home and overseas, while ensuring that trading partners don’t put arbitrary curbs on access, storage, transfer and processing of raw data. Should Washington not want to shoulder this responsibility, Beijing gladly will. Maybe not today, but in 10 years. And those rules, which will come into effect by closing (or not closing) the escape hatches of the RCEP, would be shared by 2.2 billion people. They would hardly favor U.S. interests.The cheerleaders of globalization obsessed over tariffs and non-tariff barriers and didn’t pay enough attention to the supply-chain revolution, most notably in China. To continue to view the world of trade from this outdated prism would once again cause the woods to be missed for the trees. Biden needs to bring the U.S. back to Asia, and for the right reason.(1) TPP was then modifiedto Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a free trade agreement between Canada, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2020-11-18,"(Bloomberg Markets) -- In the seconds after headlines flashed an abrupt halt to what had been billed as the world’s biggest initial public offering, a chat shared by a group of Chinese friends exploded in disbelief. China had just delivered a public drubbing to billionaire Jack Ma, one of its most-revered entrepreneurs, days before his Ant Group Co. was to be listed.The friends on WeChat understood well the sweat, tears, and brazen audacity it had taken to build Ant into a financial-services juggernaut in less than two decades: They used to work there, after all. The listing, expected to value Hangzhou-based Ant at $315 billion, would have delivered a long-awaited payday to many current employees just as an earlier IPO had enriched the chat group members. Then regulators slammed on the brakes.One of the people on the WeChat group was Yuan Leiming, a 14-year Ant veteran who left the company in 2019. He recalls heading for Hangzhou and Shanghai, expecting IPO celebrations in both places. “Ant staff were promising to buy me dinner,” he says. “Now I have to buy them dinner to placate their wounded hearts.”Yuan is among three dozen Ant tong xue—classmates—who meet regularly, usually in Shanghai, and have formed a powerful alumni network. Many of them became millionaires after Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which owns about a third of Ant, went public in 2014; others sold their Ant options back to the company when it was valued at $150 billion two years ago. All resisted the urge to hold on for Ant’s IPO. For employees who did hang on, or who joined the company more recently, the suspension threw their plans for a bonanza up in the air.Perhaps the intervention from President Xi Jinping’s government was to be expected. Ten days before it happened, Ma took to a conference stage in Shanghai to deliver a stinging rebuke of regulations that stifled innovation. The company soon came in for a deluge of criticism on Chinese state media. Commentators faulted Ant for straying from its core payments business and called out Big Tech generally for misleading users to consume beyond their means. Guo Wuping, head of consumer protection at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, said fintech companies used their market power to set exorbitant fees. QuickTake: Why China Changed the Rules on Jack Ma’s Ant GroupThree days before the planned listing, the China Securities Regulatory Commission summoned Ma to a conference room and informed him that Ant’s time as a beneficiary of relaxed government oversight and minimal capital requirements was over. Just before 9 p.m. the following day, the fintech company’s trading debut was suspended, with the securities regulator saying later that preventing a “hasty” listing while significant regulatory changes were afoot was a responsible move for potential investors.The Ant tong xue call their WeChat group “The Best Has Just Begun—Alipay Mafia,” the last bit a pointed reference to the moniker once hung on the founders of PayPal Holdings Inc., including Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who left and went on to establish successful tech enterprises. The Ant veterans chose to use the know-how gained in building the company’s ubiquitous Alipay-app ecosystem to reshape pockets of Chinese business with their own startups.They took their cues from Ma, the charismatic onetime English teacher who’s achieved cult status in China not just because of his $54 billion fortune but also because of the combative culture he fostered across his e-commerce and financial-services empire.Ma has lauded the Chinese tech industry’s notorious 996 workweek—9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week—as “huge bliss,” a driving spirit crucial to a take-no-prisoners battle that disrupted the powerful state-owned monopolies’ control over the economy. In the early days, when Alipay operated in a legal gray zone—private companies were technically not allowed in finance—Ma encouraged his employees to press on, telling them, “If someone has to go to jail, I’ll go.”Over the years, Ant and its alumni were hugely influential in reimagining China’s financial plumbing. Now, as Ma navigates once more the boundaries a communist state can impose upon private enterprise, these Antrepreneurs—almost all men—are learning new lessons, particularly about the systemically sensitive realm of finance, where fresh rules are being crafted to curb Ant and companies like it. Here are three of their stories.The Golden BoyA business management graduate of Shanghai’s elite Fudan University, Bill Deng joined Ant in 2010 after working for Visa Inc. in Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore. He soon became a favorite of Chairman Eric Jing, who directed him to focus on competitive pricing for Alipay’s services: Before Alipay expanded into the fintech giant that is now Ant, it was a scrappy online payments company trying to onboard merchants.That put Deng in regular contact with small-business owners in industries from finance to gaming to e-commerce. Immersing himself in the Yangtze and Pearl River delta regions where Chinese export manufacturers cluster, he gained insight into the challenges of operating cross-border businesses without the support of a global payments infrastructure. China’s internet boom, which would eventually fuel Alibaba’s growth into a $700 billion behemoth, was just beginning.By 2017, talk of an imminent IPO abounded. Gatherings of Ant employees—at after-work dinners, during two-minute cigarette breaks—became opportunities for staff to trade their startup aspirations, Deng says, though Ant’s “golden handcuffs” prevented most from acting on their dreams. Flush with stock options, Deng timed his departure strategically. “I figured that if I waited until Ant listed to create my own startup, I would be competing with an exodus of extremely talented Ant staff,” he says. “If I did it early, most of these people would still be working at Ant, which could provide me a network of strong allies.”Later that year, he and five former colleagues founded XTransfer Ltd., which handles cross-border financial transactions for small and medium-size businesses. The venture built on Deng’s experience of spearheading expansion in Thailand and on his relationships at work. “Ant pretty much corralled all the top talent there was in China fintech,” he says. “I was working with these men side by side in the trenches.”XTransfer works with about 80,000 clients, mostly in China, helping them adhere to international standards against money laundering and terrorism financing. It’s also built a global, low-cost payments network that lets buyers transact in their local currency and enables merchants to be paid within 24 hours—a service banks rarely offer small companies directly. The company has raised at least $30 million from investors including the Alibaba-backed Electronic World Trade Platform initiative and Beijing-based Gaorong Capital; XTransfer was valued at more than $500 million in 2019.Deng, 39, says having his own startup has helped him generate 10 times more wealth than he would have if he’d stayed at Ant. But that doesn’t mean he’s put his former boss behind him. “Jack Ma once said that he wanted to make sure even the janitor had company options,” Deng says. He got the message: At XTransfer, even the front-desk clerk has stock options.The PioneerOne of Deng’s role models is Yuan Leiming, a product pioneer in the mold of Silicon Valley explorers such as iPod creator Tony Fadell. A Peking University law major, Yuan, now 44, gained a reputation at Ant for meticulous planning and for his audacity in striking out into new areas of business.Yuan spearheaded Ant’s online-payments infrastructure, as well as its Yu’ebao money-market fund, which grew into the world’s biggest within five years of its launch by appealing to hundreds of millions of mom-and-pop savers. In the early years, Yuan worked alongside Ma himself, negotiating collaborations with China’s largest banks, cementing Ant’s role as a matchmaker shaking up the old ties between borrowers and lenders.Even before leaving Ant in 2019–and with Ant’s blessing, as there was no conflict of interest–Yuan zeroed in on transforming how Chinese pay for higher education. In China, tuition, though a fraction of what U.S. universities charge, is still unaffordable for many. “There’s something fundamentally wrong with the concept of student loans,” Yuan says. “We need to invest in ourselves most when we are young, but that burden falls predominantly on the family.”Yuan, who gets around by subway and rents bikes when he travels, persuaded a dozen current and former Ant colleagues to put a total of $7 million into a blockchain-based charity called Justsure that he believes can be a model alternative in the student loan market. Built atop Ant’s blockchain, justsure.com supports prospective students based on need, not academic excellence. Borrowers who end up making more than $18,000 a year are expected to repay their loans to the nonprofit at no more than 5% of their salary. If they don’t honor their commitment, they could be blacklisted by the government and deprived of certain rights, including air travel.“We are applying essentially a venture capital model to nurturing talent,” Yuan says. He expects just a small percentage of extremely successful students to account for the majority of repayments, not unlike the VC model of relying on a small number of winners to generate big returns.The Risk GuruTang Kewei researched artificial intelligence applications in finance during his Ph.D. studies at the University of Nottingham in England. He later moved to London with Barclays Plc as a data scientist concentrating on machine learning and AI. As China’s entrepreneurial scene thrived, Tang was bitten by the startup bug but worried he was out of touch after 12 years in the U.K. When Ant recruited globally in 2015 for a chief risk control officer for its fledgling internet bank, he jumped at the chance.At Ant’s MYbank, he built tools to analyze the risk of financing businesses in China’s rural heartland, then a greenfield market that would rapidly become heavily contested. The weight of expectation within the company was immense, Tang says, with senior executives counting on Ant’s expansion into the countryside to drive its valuation to 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion).“I thought working for a global foreign bank was already stressful, only to find out work hours at Ant were even more intense,” says the 41-year-old, who still often works well past midnight. “It was like fighting a war every day.”Sometimes a single business-development team would be pursuing as many as five initiatives simultaneously. It was common, Tang recalls, to find frontline salespeople arguing with back-end and support teams over differences in vision, banging their fists on tables or calling people out for underperformance in front of their bosses. “Some ‘sea turtles’ couldn’t stand it and left,” he says, using a colloquial term that describes Chinese people who return home after overseas educations. “To some it seemed like a lack of planning, but Ant was like that, always embracing change.”Tang and Yuan Leiming became friends at Ant, working together to build risk-control models for bank loan issuance and explore new businesses. They still catch up at dinner, nowadays to share insights on their startup lives.Tang left Ant three years ago to create Fullink Technology Co., which uses deep learning and image-recognition technology to build risk controls for companies in niche markets. Fullink has raised at least $10 million from BlueRun Ventures and Source Code Capital. In one of its projects, his team is working with a state-owned entity to create tools to evaluate the creditworthiness of cattle farmers in China’s northeast. In another, it’s joining hands with a city government to incorporate municipal data such as pension contributions, taxes, and utilities into a credit-scoring service.“Some sectors in rural finance are too niche for a giant like Ant,” Tang says. “It also needs partners like us to open up new markets.”China has changed profoundly since Ma, backed by $60,000, started Alibaba.com in 1999 as a business-to-business marketplace. A slowdown in economic growth, along with the pandemic, has created challenges as well as opportunities. The bruising back-and-forth between Washington and Beijing has choked the free flow of capital from American endowment and pension funds that used to nurture young Chinese startups. Boosted most recently by the advent of 5G and AI, challengers to Ma’s empire—and to his giant rivals, such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.—have multiplied dramatically in the two decades since he showed that business territories once dominated by powerful Chinese state-owned firms can be reshaped.And yet, as the slap-down of the Ant IPO illustrates, an age-old test hasn’t gone away: reading the Beijing tea leaves. Even as the world’s second-largest economy opens its markets and produces global technology champions, the Communist Party’s grip on power hasn’t loosened and the issues of social and financial stability are nailed to the top of Xi’s agenda.With the shock of the regulators’ rebuke to Ma still fresh, someone on the Alipay Mafia WeChat group shared a meme showing how the government is cutting Ant down to size, one rule at a time. The phrase pan ta—rein him in—was joined to an emoji of an animated cartoon character’s bottom being scrubbed over and over.Not so fast, says Tang: “This thing is not a thing.” Don’t underestimate Ma, the tong xue, or any of his legions of tech disciples. “Ant folks,” Tang says, “are super tenacious.”Chen covers investing for Bloomberg News in Hong Kong. For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Ant Alumni Who Cashed Out Before IPO Flop Have Big Ambitions

2020-11-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last week’s public spat between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have set an end date for the central bank’s unprecedented intervention in U.S. credit markets. But make no mistake, the legacy of this episode will most likely permanently change investors’ mindset during periods of crisis.In particular, the Fed’s swift purchases of corporate-bond exchange-traded funds set a clear precedent for the type of policy response that traders can expect during the next period of economic distress — or what section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act calls “unusual and exigent circumstances.” In contrast to the central bank’s Main Street Lending Program and Municipal Liquidity Facility, which didn’t get many takers, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility revved up in a hurry and provided an even stronger backstop to financial assets than traders saw coming.Recall that on March 23, the Fed unveiled the credit facility, explaining that it could buy high-grade corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds tracking that market. Then on April 9, it amended the parameters to allow for purchases of double-B rated junk bonds as long as the company had investment grades as of March 22. Just for good measure, it also added a provision that it could buy high-yield ETFs, even though that seemingly defied explanation. By May 12, the facility was gobbling up ETFs, executing 35 separate trades totaling $305 million, according to disclosures to Congress. The next day it bought $330 million. And on and on it went until July 23, the last day the central bank added corporate-debt ETFs. By that time, it had switched over to individual bonds, seemingly by skirting the law and creating an entirely new class of eligible assets called “Broad Market Index Bonds.” Those purchases have continued unabated through at least Oct. 29, when the Fed bought debt of Amazon.com Inc., Kroger Co. and Visa Inc., among others.It’s telling that the Fed plunged first into ETFs through secondary-market purchases. The central bank sought to ease financial conditions as quickly as possible, and corporate-bond ETFs, which trade transparently in real time and represent the broad market, are an easy way to do that. In fact, by the time the facility got around to buying individual bonds on June 16, the yield on the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Bond index was already at a record low of 2.18%.The ETF purchases were so successful, and so relatively effortless, that such a strategy is not only likely to serve as the blueprint for the next corporate credit crunch, but it also raises the obvious prospect of the Fed going even further during a market meltdown and buying another financial asset that trades on exchanges: U.S. stocks.Powell didn’t exactly slam the door on this option when Politico’s Victoria Guida brought it up during his July 29 press conference. She asked: “What is the scope of your authority under 13(3)? What type of assets are you allowed to buy? Could you buy equities through an SPV, for example?”Here’s his response (lightly edited for clarity):We haven’t done any work or thought about buying equities. But we’re bound by the provisions of 13(3), which requires that we make programs or facilities of broad applicability, meaning it can’t just be focused on one entity. It has to be a broad group of entities. There’s a lot in 13(3) about the solvency of the borrowers. Remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that was meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions. There was a lot in there to make sure that they were going to be solvent and things like that. So we have to meet those requirements. We haven’t looked and tried to say, “what can we buy?” and “let’s make a complete list.” None of this seems to preclude equity ETFs. Certainly, indexes tracking the broad stock market could include companies that are struggling to stay solvent. But in April, the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (ticker: HYG) had 11.3% of its assets in bonds rated triple-C or double-C. The Fed’s facility now has a $325 million stake in it.Guida even followed up to give Powell one more out to differentiate the Fed from the Bank of Japan, which has been buying equity ETFs for several years: “Is it generally supposed to be primarily directed at debt instruments, since you talked about borrowers?” Powell replied:The statute doesn’t say that, but, yeah, you could read the statute that way if you want. Honestly, we haven’t tried to push it to, you know, what’s the theoretical limit of it. I mean, I think, clearly, it’s supposed to replace lending. That’s really what you’re doing. You’re stepping in to provide credit at times when the market has stopped functioning. That’s fundamentally what you’re doing with 13(3). And so I think you’ve got to sort of work within that framework.In truth, the secondary-market credit facility never functioned like this once it was operational. It’s hard to see how buying ETFs, or even individual bonds on the open market, replaces lending. It mostly serves to prop up debt prices to encourage private lenders to engage in public markets. Ironically, the Fed program that would have actually stepped in to provide direct credit to corporations, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, has never been used. Mnuchin noted on Friday that Fed officials “always like to keep things open.” He added that while some other facilities would be extended for 90 days, “we don’t need to buy more corporate bonds.”He’s right on both counts. As of the end of October, the Fed holds $8.6 billion of corporate-bond ETFs and $4.8 billion of individual securities. While that’s still just a fraction of the facility’s potential firepower, adding more debt in the secondary market with yields at record lows isn’t serving as a “backstop” in any sense of the word. However, I’ve argued for extending the lifelines for municipal and Main Street borrowing precisely because they’re only ever used by those who need it the most, like New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is facing a fiscal reckoning.It’s still unclear how much of Mnuchin’s decision was driven by prudence versus politics. Either way, Powell said in a letter released late Friday that the Fed would return the money to Treasury as asked, meaning the central bank’s corporate credit facilities will be shut down after New Year’s Eve, earlier than it anticipated.That shouldn’t bother investors too much. Instead, they’ll likely take comfort in knowing what the central bank and Treasury are capable of in credit markets during the next unforeseen crisis and how that’s just a stone’s throw away from directly intervening in equities. For better or worse, the “Fed put” is here to stay.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-11-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Visa Inc. is delaying plans to raise the swipe fees paid by certain U.S. merchants each time a customer uses a credit card in-store as the coronavirus pandemic continues to crimp commerce across the country.The network told merchants this month it will leave consumer credit card-present retail rates unchanged, citing the pandemic’s effects on in-store shopping, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. A spokesman for Visa declined to comment.Visa had planned to make the biggest changes to swipe fees in a decade this year, with higher rates planned for transactions on e-commerce sites. Some retailers, such as those in real estate or education, were set to see such fees decline.The network opted to delay the changes as the pandemic took hold across the U.S., forcing consumers to stay inside and crimping transactions on the firm’s network. The planned changes will now happen in April 2021.“Given the unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy, Visa determined it would not make any structural changes to the payments ecosystem over the last year,” the network said in the document.Tokenization PushIn the initial proposed changes, Visa said the interchange rate for so-called card-not-present transactions, which include those made online or over the phone, will increase. For a traditional Visa card, the fee on a $100 transaction will climb to $1.99 from $1.90. For premium Visa cards, the fee will rise to $2.60 from $2.50.While those rates are still set to go into effect in April, the network said it will offer a lower rate for merchants who elect to tokenize those transactions using a Visa EMV payment token, starting in October.Visa, along with Mastercard Inc., has spent years promoting tokenization technology. The service was designed to reduce online card fraud and help issuers approve more transactions by swapping sensitive information such as account numbers with a unique one-time use set of numbers that validates a customer’s identity.Still, there’s been resistance to the technology. Merchants have complained that they’ve lost the ability to route certain debit-card transactions over alternative, cheaper networks for online and mobile-wallet transactions that use tokenization.“Incentivizing greater use of tokens will improve e-commerce authorization rates and bolster security at a time when fraudsters are increasingly targeting digital and e-commerce channels,” Visa said in its message.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Visa Stalls Plans to Raise Fees for Some In-Store Retailers

Marqeta in June added its first independent directors, a move that’s often viewed as a precursor to a foray into the public markets.In May, the company said it raised $150 million at a $4.3 billion valuation.

2020-11-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin plunged on Thursday in a sell-off that saw other digital assets fall more than 20%, a slide likely to stoke speculation about the durability of the latest boom in cryptocurrencies.The largest token fell as much as 14% in Thursday trading, heading for one of its worst days since the pandemic-spurred liquidation in March.The rout began just hours after Bitcoin rose to within $7 of its record high of $19,511, the culmination of a more than 250% surge in past nine months. Fears over tighter crypto regulation and profit-taking after a frenetic rally were among the reasons cited for the sudden drop.The sell-off gathered pace late Wednesday after Coinbase Inc. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong tweeted about speculation the U.S. is considering new rules that would undermine anonymity in digital transactions.“News that the Trump administration may clamp down on crypto might have been a trigger for the drop,” said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner of Nexo in London, which bills itself as the world’s biggest digital-coin lender. “But any asset that rallies 75% in 2 months and 260% from the March lows is allowed to undergo a correction.”Other coins including XRP tumbled as much as 27%, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.After garnering more support from Wall Street money managers and fund providers, the rally in cryptocurrencies had looked over-heated. The fierce retreat could stir yet another debate over the their value in diversifying portfolios.“Conditions are very massively overbought and bound for a correction,” said Vijay Ayyar, head of business development with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore. “So I don’t think it’s unusual.”Crypto believers tout purchases by retail investors, institutions and even billionaires, as well as the search for a hedge against dollar weakness amid the pandemic, as reasons why the boom can last.Skeptics argue the cryptocurrency’s famed volatility portends a repeat of what happened three years ago, when a bubble burst spectacularly. Some see signs of retail investors piling in to chase momentum for fast gains, storing up an inevitable reckoning.Concern about potential U.S. crypto rules help explain Thursday’s price drop across most major digital assets, said Ryan Rabaglia, global head of trading at OSL brokerage in Hong Kong.“It’s also not unusual to see a short-term pullback following periods of significant, accelerated gains as traders look to take profits before resetting once volatility subsides,” he said. “Once the dust settles, we’re back to business as usual with all medium to long-term bullish indicators still in play.”Proponents of digital assets say the current focus on cryptocurrencies compared with three years ago is different because of growing institutional interest, for instance from the likes of Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase & Co.Just this week, Van Eck Associates Corp. launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded note on the Deutsche Boerse Xetra exchange. In October, PayPal Holdings Inc. said it would allow its customers access to cryptocurrencies.There is also a buzz around Ethereum, the most-actively used blockchain in the world, which is set for a network upgrade that would allow it to process a similar number of transactions as Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. The shift to the new system could curb the total supply of Ether, whose price has quadrupled so far this year.Luno’s Ayyar said he expects Bitcoin to stabilize and achieve all-time highs. But that would be followed by a larger drop in the cryptocurrency, he said.Soravis Srinawakoon, chief executive of Bangkok-based Band Protocol, said the plunge in crypto was healthy.“This is just a normal pull back after seven weeks straight of Bitcoin in the green, due to many people over-leveraging.”(Updates prices)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Bitcoin Plunges Along With Other Coins
2020-11-27,"Shares of Visa (NYSE: V) decreased by 0.63% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Visa has.Visa's Debt According to the Visa's most recent financial statement as reported on November 19, 2020, total debt is at $24.07 billion, with $21.07 billion in long-term debt and $3.00 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $16.29 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $7.78 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Visa has $80.92 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.3. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-11-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In “Shuggie Bain,” Douglas Stuart’s award-winning and harrowing depiction of alcoholism, sectarianism and deprivation in post-industrial Scotland, money is always scarce and often dirty. Deserted by her second husband and unable to hold down a job, Shuggie’s mother, Agnes, relies on her twice-a-week child benefit to feed her children — or her booze habit. As the latter nearly always wins, she and Shuggie are regularly reduced to desperate expedients to fend off starvation: Extracting coins from electricity and television meters, pawning their few valuable possessions, and ultimately selling their bodies for brutal sexual favors. Stuart vividly captures the miseries of a Glasgow of greasy coins and filthy banknotes. After one of many wretched copulations in the back of a taxi, one of Agnes’s lovers inadvertently showers her with coins from his pocket. Shuggie’s father briefly reappears at one point, handing his son two 20-pence pieces from his taxi’s change dispenser by way of a gift, grudgingly adding four 50-pence pieces when the boy looks nonplused. ﻿(“Don’t ask for mair!”) The “rag-and-bone man,” who goes from house to house buying old clothes and junk, pays “with a roll of grubby pound notes” bound by an old Band-Aid. The image is especially startling because banknotes have so rarely featured in the narrative. The only credit in this world is from rent-to-own catalogues, the Provident doorstep lender, and a few hard-pressed shopkeepers.I grew up in middle-class, mostly sober Glasgow, but I still remember the tyranny of those damned coins: the nightmare of having too few for a bus fare or the wrong sort for a phone box. To my children, all this is as much a part of ancient lore as pirate chests of doubloons once were to me. Coins are fast fading from their lives, soon to be followed by banknotes. In some parts of the world — not only China but also Sweden — nearly all payments are now electronic. In the U.S., debit card transactions have exceeded cash transactions since 2017. Even in Latin America and parts of Africa, cash is yielding to cards and a growing number of people manage their money through their phones.We are living through a monetary revolution so multifaceted that few of us comprehend its full extent. The technological transformation of the internet is driving this revolution. The pandemic of 2020 has accelerated it. To illustrate the extent of our confusion, consider the divergent performance of three forms of money this year: the U.S. dollar, gold and Bitcoin.The dollar is the world’s favorite money, not only dominant in central bank reserves but in international transactions. It is a fiat currency, its supply determined by the Federal Reserve and U.S. banks. We can compute its value relative to the goods consumers buy, according to which measure it has scarcely depreciated this year (inflation is running at 1.2%), or relative to other fiat currencies. On the latter basis, according to Bloomberg’s dollar spot index, it is down 4% since Jan. 1. Gold, by contrast, is up 15% in dollar terms. But the dollar price of a bitcoin has risen 139% year-to-date.This year’s Bitcoin rally has caught many smart people by surprise. Last week’s high was just below the peak of the last rally ($19,892 according to the exchange Coinbase) in December 2017. When Bitcoin subsequently sold off, the New York University economist Nouriel Roubini didn’t hold back. Bitcoin, he told CNBC in February 2018, had been the “biggest bubble in human history.” Its price would now “crash to zero.” Eight months later, Roubini returned to the fray in congressional testimony, denouncing Bitcoin as the “mother of all scams.” In tweets, he referred to it as “Shitcoin.”Fast forward to November 2020, and Roubini has been forced to change his tune. Bitcoin, he conceded in an interview with Yahoo Finance, was “maybe a partial store of value, because … it cannot be so easily debased because there is at least an algorithm that decides how much the supply of bitcoin raises over time.” If I were as fond of hyperbole as he is, I would call this the biggest conversion since St. Paul.Roubini is not the only one who has been forced to reassess Bitcoin this year. Among the big-name investors who have turned bullish are Paul Tudor Jones, Stan Druckenmiller and Bill Miller. Even Ray Dalio admitted the other day that he “might be missing something” about Bitcoin.Financial journalists, too, are capitulating: On Tuesday, the Financial Times’s Izabella Kaminska, a long-time cryptocurrency skeptic, conceded that Bitcoin had a valid use-case as a hedge against a dystopian future “in which the world slips towards authoritarianism and civil liberties cannot be taken for granted.” She is on to something there, as we shall see.So what is going on?First, we should not be surprised that a pandemic has quickened the pace of monetary evolution. In the wake of the Black Death, as the historian Mark Bailey noted in his masterful 2019 Oxford Ford lectures, there was an increased monetization of the English economy. Prior to the ravages of bubonic plague, the feudal system had bound peasants to the land and required them to pay rent in kind, handing over a share of all produce to their lord. With chronic labor shortages came a shift toward  fixed, yearly tenant rents paid in cash. In Italy, too, the economy after the 1340s became more monetized: It was no accident that the most powerful Italian family of the 15th and 16th centuries were the Medici, who made their fortune as Florentine moneychangers.In a similar way, Covid-19 has been good for Bitcoin and for cryptocurrency generally. First, the pandemic accelerated our advance into a more digital word: What might have taken 10 years has been achieved in 10 months. People who had never before risked an online transaction were forced to try, for the simple reason that banks were closed. Second, and as a result, the pandemic significantly increased our exposure to financial surveillance as well as financial fraud. Both these trends have been good for Bitcoin.I never subscribed to the thesis that Bitcoin would go to zero after it plunged in price in late 2017 and 2018. In the updated 2018 edition of my book, “The Ascent of Money” — the first edition of which appeared more or less simultaneously with the foundational Bitcoin paper by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — I argued that Bitcoin had established itself as “a new store of value and investment asset — a type of ‘digital gold’ that provides investors with guaranteed scarcity and high mobility, as well as low correlation with other asset classes.”“Satoshi’s goal,” I argued, “was not to create a new money but rather to create the ultimate safe asset, capable of protecting wealth from confiscation in jurisdictions with poor investor protection as well as from the near-universal scourge of currency depreciation … Bitcoin is portable, liquid, anonymous and scarce … A simple thought experiment would imply that $6,000 is therefore a cheap price for this new store of value.”Two years ago, I estimated that around 17 million bitcoins had been mined. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, was then 36 million, with total wealth of $128.7 trillion. “If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as Bitcoin,” I argued, “the price would be above $75,000 — higher, if adjustment is made for all the bitcoins that have been lost or hoarded. Even if the millionaires held just 0.2% of their assets as Bitcoin, the price would be around $15,000.” We passed $15,000 on Nov. 8.What is happening is that Bitcoin is gradually being adopted not so much as means of payment but as a store of value. Not only high-net-worth individuals but also tech companies are investing. In July, Michael Saylor, the billionaire founder of MicroStrategy, directed his company to hold part of its cash reserves in alternative assets. By September, MicroStrategy’s corporate treasury had purchased bitcoins worth $425 million. Square, the San Francisco-based payments company, bought bitcoins worth $50 million last month. PayPal just announced that American users can buy, hold and sell bitcoins in their PayPal wallets.This process of adoption has much further to run. In the words of Wences Casares, the Argentine-born tech investor who is one of Bitcoin’s most ardent advocates, “After 10 years of working well without interruption, with close to 100 million holders, adding more than 1 million new holders per month and moving more than $1 billion per day worldwide,” it has a 50% chance of hitting a price of $1 million per bitcoin in five to seven years’ time.Whoever he is or was, Satoshi summed up how Bitcoin works: It is “a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” that allows “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” In essence, Bitcoin is a public ledger shared by a network of computers. To pay with bitcoins, you send a signed message transferring ownership to a receiver’s public key. Transactions are grouped together and added to the ledger in blocks, and every node in the network has an entire copy of this blockchain at all times. A node can add a block to the chain (and receive a bitcoin reward) only by solving a cryptographic puzzle chosen by the Bitcoin protocol, which consumes processing power.Nodes that have solved the cryptographic puzzle — “miners,” in Bitspeak — are rewarded  not only with transaction fees (5 bitcoins per day, on average), but also with additional bitcoins — 900 new bitcoins per day. This reward will get cut in half every four years until the total number of bitcoins reaches 21 million, after which no new bitcoins will be created.There are three obvious defects to Bitcoin. As a means of payment, it is slow. The Bitcoin blockchain can process only around 3,000 transactions every 10 minutes. Transaction costs are not trivial: Coinbase will charge a 1.49% commission if you want to buy one bitcoin.There is also a significant negative externality: Bitcoin’s “proof-of-work” consensus algorithm requires specialized computer chips that consume a great deal of energy — 60 terawatt-hours of electricity a year, just under half the annual electricity consumption of Argentina. Aside from the environmental costs, one unforeseen consequence has been the increasing concentration of Bitcoin mining in a relatively few hands — many of them Chinese — wherever there is cheap energy.But these disadvantages are outweighed by two unique features. First, as we have seen, Bitcoin offers built-in scarcity in a virtual world characterized by boundless abundance. Second, Bitcoin is sovereign. In the words of Casares, “No one can change a transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain and no one can keep the Bitcoin blockchain from accepting new transactions.” Bitcoin users can pay without going through intermediaries such as banks. They can transact without needing governments to enforce settlement.The advantages of scarcity are obvious at a time when the supply of fiat money is exploding. Take M2, a measure of money that includes cash, bank accounts (including savings deposits) and money market mutual funds. Since May, U.S. M2 has been growing at a year-on-year rate above 20%, compared with an average of 5.9% since 1982. The future weakness of the dollar has been a favorite 2020 talking point for Wall Street economists such as Steve Roach. You can see why. There really are a lot of dollars around, even if their velocity of circulation has slumped because of the pandemic.The advantages of sovereignty are less obvious but may be more important. Bitcoin is not the only form of digital money that has flourished in 2020. China has been advancing rapidly in two different ways.Nowhere in the world are mobile payments happening on as large a scale as in China, thanks to the spectacular growth of Alipay and WeChat Pay. Those electronic payment platforms now handle close to $40 trillion of transactions a year, more than double the volume of Visa and Mastercard combined, according to calculations by Ribbit Capital. The Chinese platforms are expanding rapidly abroad, partly through investments in local fintech companies by Ant Group and Tencent.At the same time, the People’s Bank of China has accelerated the rollout of its digital currency. The potential for a digital yuan to be adopted for remittance payments or cross-border trade settlements is substantial, especially if — as seems likely — countries participating in the One Belt One Road program are encouraged to use it. Even governments that are resisting Chinese financial penetration, such as India, are essentially building their own versions of China’s electronic payments systems.Some economists, such as my friend Ken Rogoff, welcome the demise of cash because it will make the management of monetary policy easier and organized crime harder. But it will be a fundamentally different world when all our payments are recorded, centrally stored, and scrutinized by artificial intelligence — regardless of whether it is Amazon’s Jeff Bezos or China’s Xi Jinping who can access our data.In its early years, Bitcoin suffered reputational damage because it was adopted by criminals and used for illicit transactions. Such nefarious activity has not gone away, as a recent Justice Department report makes clear. Increasingly, however, Bitcoin has an appeal to respectable individuals and institutions who would like at least some part of their economic lives to be sheltered from the gaze of Big Brother.It is not (as the term “cryptocurrency” misleadingly implies) that Bitcoin is beyond the reach of the law or the taxman. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation busted the online illegal goods market Silk Road in 2013, it showed how readily government agencies can trace the counterparties in suspect Bitcoin transactions. This is precisely because the blockchain is an indelible record of all Bitcoin transactions, complete with senders’ and receivers’ bitcoin addresses.Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service is perfectly prepared to demand information on bitcoin accounts from exchanges, as Coinbase discovered in 2016. A rumor of new U.S. Treasury regulations requiring greater disclosures by exchanges caused a sharp crypto selloff over Thanksgiving. The point is simply that the financial data of law-abiding individuals is better protected by Bitcoin than by Alipay. As the Stanford political theorist Stephen Krasner pointed out more than 20 years ago, sovereignty is a relative concept.Rather than seeking to create a Chinese-style digital dollar, Joe Biden’s nascent administration should recognize the benefits of integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system — which, after all, was originally designed to be less centralized and more respectful of individual privacy than the systems of less-free societies.Life in the East End of Glasgow in the 1980s was nasty, brutish and short of money. But all those transactions in grubby pounds and pence — genuine shitcoins — were, if nothing else, private. If Agnes Bain bought Special Brew instead of oven chips, it was a matter for her, the shopkeeper, and her long-suffering kids; the state was none the wiser. That was scant consolation to poor Shuggie. But, as we have learned again this year, a free society comes at a price that is not always payable in cash.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-11-30,"Shares of Visa (NYSE: V) saw some unusual options activity on Monday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $209.44.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-09-17  * Strike Price: $200.00  * Volume: 0  * Open Interest: 19152Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * A Look Into Visa's Debt  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Libra Association, a cryptocurrency project started by Facebook Inc. that drew regulatory blowback worldwide, is hoping a new name offers a fresh chance to win over regulators and gain a foothold in the emerging market.The group will now be known as Diem Association, named for the word “day” in Latin, with its subsidiary Diem Networks serving as the payment system operator. It’s readying a currency that will be called the Diem Dollar.“We like the connotation of it kind of being a new day for the project,” the group’s chief executive officer, Stuart Levey, said in an interview. “We wanted a new start.”Almost immediately after Libra launched in June 2019, politicians and regulators raised concerns about the effort. They worried about privacy, money laundering and companies like Facebook taking power away from central banks. Supporters like PayPal Holdings Inc. and Visa Inc. fled the project, which initially hoped to attract 100 members before launch.The new Diem, which has 27 participants today, has abandoned the 100-member goal by launch and is taking things more slowly. The group plans to issue a stablecoin -- a digital currency pegged to an outside asset -- that’s tied to the U.S. dollar. Later, Diem may pursue additional fiat-based cryptocurrencies, Levey said.Initially, Libra had proposed creating a cryptocurrency supported by a basket of government-issued fiat currencies and securities.The group no longer needs 100 members to launch, though it’s still hoping to expand its ranks, Levey said.The association also no longer plans to eventually transition to a so-called permissionless blockchain, which would have let anyone participate in verifying transactions.Other inner workings of the project may have changed as well. Levey declined to comment on whether investors in the association will end up receiving a special governance coin, as per an earlier plan.With the project’s ambitions scaled down, its appeal may have dwindled. There’s plenty of competition from existing U.S. dollar-based stablecoins, such as Tether and USD Coin. One rival, called Celo Dollar, is also governed by an association, which attracted many of the same companies that initially flocked to Libra.Facebook has more than 2 billion users, some of whom may be persuaded to give Diem a try. But the social-networking giant has previously worked to distance itself from Libra. In May, it renamed its Calibra blockchain group Novi to make it sound less like Libra.The Novi team is building a digital wallet that will eventually hold Diem coins, Levey said.The Diem effort is waiting to be issued a license by Swiss regulators to launch, Levey said. Diem is also in talks with U.S. federal and state regulators, but isn’t waiting for any specific licenses or approvals from them, he said.To satisfy regulators, Diem’s system will honor Western sanctions and regulatory reporting requirements.“All of these design features we think make for a project we think that regulators will welcome,” Levey said, adding that he hopes central banks may wish to use the infrastructure in the future to issue their own digital currencies.(Updates with CEO’s comment in seventh paragraph.

2020-12-04,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration claims Facebook Inc. is discriminating against U.S. workers by designating thousands of positions for foreigners with temporary H-1B visas.The company “refused to recruit, consider, or hire qualified and available U.S. workers for over 2,600 positions” and instead reserved the jobs -- with an average salary of $156,000 -- to non-citizens that it sponsored for permanent work authorizations with green cards, according a statement issued Thursday by the civil rights division of the Justice Department.The complaint reflects the pressure President Donald Trump is keeping on social media giants even in the waning days of his administration. It comes after judges have blocked efforts by the administration to halt access to several types of employment-based visas, part of Trump’s broader agenda to prioritize filling positions at U.S. companies with Americans.The administration is also moving to curtail legal protections for internet platforms amid complaints by the president and other Republicans that Facebook, Twitter and Google engage in censorship targeting conservative viewpoints.Facebook said it has been cooperating with the Justice Department.“While we dispute the allegations in the complaint, we cannot comment further on pending litigation,” the company said in a statement.Read More: Trump Cracks Down on Visa Program That Feeds Silicon ValleyRon Hira, an associate professor Howard University who’s done extensive research on H-1B visa issues, said Trump is cracking down on visa abuse more aggressively than the Obama administration did. “Those who have been tracking it have been disappointed that he didn’t do it quicker,” he said.Hira noted a statistic in the government’s complaint that the Facebook positions at issue typically drew zero or one U.S. applicants, while comparable jobs advertised on its careers website got 100 or more applications.“U.S. workers want these jobs,” he said. “The fact there’s only one or zero applications would be pretty shocking.”Instead of suing Facebook in federal court, the Justice Department lodged a complaint with its own Executive Office of Immigration Review, where it will be reviewed by an administrative law judge. The director of the office is appointed by the U.S. attorney general.The case is part of a 2017 initiative by the department targeting companies that discriminate against U.S. workers, according to the department’s statement. The department has reached settlements totaling more than $1.2 million with about 10 employers, including a Florida strawberry farm, a Texas bus company, a California IT staffing firm and a Colorado agricultural products supplier.Read More: Apple to Amazon Line Up Against Trump’s Immigrant Visa BanFacebook, one of dozens of tech companies that lined up in court against Trump’s visa restrictions, stands out as much bigger than the typical targets of enforcement actions under the Justice Department’s Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative.“Facebook engaged in intentional and widespread violations of the law, by setting aside positions for temporary visa holders instead of considering interested and qualified U.S. workers,” Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband said in the statement.The Justice Department seeks an order compelling Facebook to change its practices as well as civil penalties plus back pay, including interest, for workers who were discriminated against, according to the complaint.(Updates with professor’s comment in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Accused by Trump Administration of H-1B Visa Abuse

Kristof argued that Pornhub doesn’t adequately block content depicting violence and allows videos to be downloaded from its site, which means that material can spread even after it’s removed.Mastercard said Saturday that it doesn’t tolerate illegal activity on its payment network, and that it’s reviewing ties to MindGeek.

In Q4, Visa posted an ROCE of 0.09%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on VROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Visa is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In Visa's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q4 Earnings Insight Visa reported Q4 earnings per share at $1.12/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.1/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For December 7, 2020  * Analyzing Visa's Unusual Options Activity(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Bitcoin started October at around $10,400. By December 1, it came shy of $20,000, rising above $19,783 — the previous record it had seen in December 2017.

As an alternate asset class, the cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy and evolving. Given the recent price rally, BTC is likely to be volatile in the final weeks of the year as some investors may decide to ring the cash register and take profits. However, I expect BTC to offer substantial returns for long-term investors who have 2-3 year horizons. Let’s see why.
The Crypto Market Continues To Grow
The past decade has seen significant growth in financial technology (fintech), leading to significant share price increases in companies like Visa (NYSE:V), Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Square (NYSE:SQ).
The great recession of 2008-2009 contributed to advances in the digitalization of money and the birth of cryptocurrencies. As the global financial crisis hit over a decade ago, the public became doubtful of broader markets and some of the actions taken by central banks worldwide within a fiat currency-centered, interconnected global financial system.
Bitcoin’s history also goes to 2009, when the world first heard of cryptocurrencies. Now there are over 1,600 different cryptocurrencies available to investors. Yet, with its first-mover advantage, Bitcoin gets the most attention and has the highest market cap.

Investors are attracted to cryptocurrencies for many reasons. For instance, research by Linda Schilling of Ecole Polytechnique, CREST, France and Harald Uhlig of University of Chicago highlights how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are not “controlled by central banks or central institutions. [S]everal features distinguish Bitcoin from for instance Visa, Paypal, and cash such as censorship resistance, transparency, and speed of trading. These characteristics may be important for future research when thinking about Bitcoin speculation.”
The current pandemic has also meant increased reliance on e-commerce, contributing to the use of digital wallets and e-money. Meanwhile, growing institutional demand could indicate Bitcoin will continue to see new record highs in 2021. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) suggests Bitcoin could potentially “replace gold to a large extent,” ready for “considerable” upside, as it competes with gold as an alternative currency.
Finally, regular InvestorPlace.com readers would likely know that in October, PayPal enabled its US-based clients to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies right from their accounts.
The Bottom Line on Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a hot investment topic. Given the recent significant run-up in price, we can expect some investors in BTC to take part of their paper profits soon. A potential decline toward $16,000 or below could give potential investors a better entry point.
The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC) could be one way to access Bitcoin. So far in the year, it is up 145%. Fidelity Investments also recently started the legal process for setting up the first Bitcoin mutual fund ever. If the current level of institutional interest could be seen as a bullish sign, BTC’s market-cap could potentially reach $1 trillion in the new decade. Millennials’ support is expected to contribute to this demand and further solidify Bitcoin’s status as both a means of payment and a store of wealth.
Those market participants who do not want to experience the daily choppiness in BTC could consider investing in shares of companies leading the fintech revolution and are among institutions showing interest in Bitcoin.
Examples of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would give exposure to the cryptocurrency and blockchain, the technology behind these digital assets, include the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSEARCA:BLOK), the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW), the First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF (NASDAQ:LEGR), the Goldman Sachs Innovate Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:GINN), the Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (NYSEARCA:KOIN), and the Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ:BLCN).

2020-12-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Last year’s backlash against Facebook Inc.’s planned digital currency Libra would have been most CEOs’ worst nightmare.Governments and regulators linked arms to repel a perceived threat to monetary sovereignty, financial stability and data privacy. The more Mark Zuckerberg tried to reassure politicians by talking up financial inclusion and innovation, the more he came across like a tobacco boss denying cigarettes are addictive. He even acknowledged the problem: “I get that I’m not the ideal messenger for this.”That hasn’t deterred him. Given Zuckerberg’s tendency to issue half-hearted apologies before going back to breaking things, it’s not surprising that he’s gearing up for a second attempt to launch Libra next year.There have been a few changes: Libra is now called Diem – as in Carpe — and its membership council is headed by Stuart Levey, whose stints at the U.S. Treasury and HSBC Holdings Plc make him a blend of Beltway and banking. There’s no more talk of rewards for members in the form of “investment tokens.”Technically, Facebook is only one of Diem’s 27 members, and Diem says it’s an independent organization — Facebook will be providing an electronic wallet alongside it. But this project was created and funded by Zuckerberg’s company, and the association’s six-seat board includes David Marcus, head of Facebook’s cryptocurrency efforts. The biggest new concession to regulators is that Facebook will no longer create a single global currency. Rather than craft a synthetic Libra out of a basket of euros, dollars and yen — much like the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights — Diem will be made up of multiple single-currency stablecoins, pegged to each one. Converting a dollar or euro into a digital Diem would be a one-to-one transaction, with little chance of wild Bitcoin-level volatility or an overnight disruption of fiat currencies.Facebook is even proposing that central banks one day use the Diem blockchain to issue digital currencies, similar to China’s testing of a digital yuan.This plea for legitimacy suggests Facebook is leaning more toward the kind of electronic cash offered by PayPal Holdings Inc. or Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., than the revolutionary crypto dreams of Bitcoiners. A digital dollar that’s transferable anywhere and at any time could in theory be a draw for consumers (even if in practice it’s regulation, rather than technology, that’s the cause of transaction slowness). Teunis Brosens, a senior economist at ING, reckons Diem may end up like a plain-vanilla “e-money” wallet. Blockchain expert David Gerard has called it “Paypal-but-it’s-Facebook.”It’s the “it’s-Facebook” part that should keep governments on their guard. E-money firms are often start-ups with Visa cards. Facebook, together with its WhatsApp and Instagram platforms, boasts 3 billion monthly users. If they each generate $6 in sales, Diem would represent an $18 billion revenue stream overnight.After U.S. regulators this month accused Facebook of unfairly abusing its market power to monopolize social media, will it compete fairly in this new arena or squash the competition? Imagine if Facebook’s ad contracts were one day tied to Diem, or if it abused its access to customers’ financial data. Trustbusters will be glad Libra didn’t lift off earlier.It’s likely more regulation is needed. As German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz put it, referring to Libra’s name change, “a wolf in sheep’s clothing is still a wolf.” The noose is already tightening around such stablecoins with Europe imposing more bank-like capital requirements, says Simon Polrot, head of crypto-development non-profit ADAN. If it takes off, regulators might also want an inside peek into how Diem manages its cash reserves. As for money-laundering risks, Zuckerberg will no doubt sign up to “know your customer” rules, but how effective will Facebook be in tackling bad actors? And will it enforce the U.S.’s extraterritorial sanctions?Lawmakers may wonder whether Facebook needs a banking license, something it really doesn’t want. Zuckerberg will no doubt argue that Diem is an association, independent of his empire. But it resembles a Potemkin village populated by payments firms, non-profits and venture capital funds. There are no banks, and none of the other FAANGs. Those who left Libra, such as PayPal, haven’t returned.No one should underestimate Zuckerberg’s determination to launch this product. In the face of widespread criticism, he is coming back for more and Marcus. his top financial-services executive, is asking for “the benefit of the doubt” from regulators. That line wouldn’t work in a car-repair shop, let alone a bank. Still, Facebook deserves a fair hearing, given Zuckerberg has changed Libra’s message. If it falls on deaf ears, maybe the problem is the messenger.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Lionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the European Union and France.

Usually there is a small group of stocks that trade with a lot of momentum. When they rally, they do it so hard that it makes them impossible to buy with conviction. This year, that group is huge, including a slew of special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in the electric vehicle sector. Just yesterday, we saw an explosion in them because of the rumor that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wants to produce a self-driving EV by 2024.
Given all the general hype on the market lately, a key question arises for SQ investors. Is it appropriate to buy Square stock, even at these altitudes?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
There isn’t one clear answer for all investors. The decision to buy a stock depends on several factors. The first is your timeline. How long you are looking to hold a stock will play a big role in the decision. If the goal is to invest in SQ for years, then it’s fine to buy a partial position now. A few bucks above or below are not going to matter much. Otherwise, this is not an obvious starting point for new buyers.
Square Stock Is Already a Super Star

Year-to-date it has already rallied over 280%, so the easy work is done. PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which has also had a good year, is only up 125% for the same period. Square stock has outperformed its cohort by at least a double and is up 20 times more than the S&P 500. Such performance is hard to maintain for the short term.

Looking at the chart for SQ, we can clearly see an ascending channel with a steep slope. It is currently skirting the upper edges of it, so logic dictates that it should revert to the mean soon. This does not suggest that it will collapse because it has several lines of support along the way. It would be perfectly normal for it to fall 10% and still remain a very bullish chart. $220 per share would be the first available pivot point with another one $20 lower.
I would not expect catastrophe unless the entire market corrects. Even if it collapses, it would make for an unbelievable opportunity to initiate or double down near $185 per share. I am by no means calling for that price to happen all by itself. Management has worked hard at positioning the company right for the future. Square and PayPal quietly outsmarted the legacy credit card companies Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). They are quickly becoming the way people want to transact financially.
The novel coronavirus pandemic forced the world to seek electronic ways of transferring money while quarantining. Square was there and even made it possible for deposits to happen. Then bitcoin entered the fray with its incredible rally this year. Much to the chagrin of the naysayers, bitcoin broke through $24,000, crushing the prior high of 2017. Square has benefited from the rally because they have their finger on that pulse already. Any which way you slice it, this company is ready to take financial transactions to the next level. It can even create its own ecosphere for other business ventures in e-commerce.
Square Is Cheap
Most traditional investors see the ramp in a stock like this and immediately judge it as expensive. I contend that this is a perfect example of where value is in the eye of the beholder. This is absolutely a growth company because it almost quintupled its revenues in four years. Growth like this cannot come cheaply, so it’s okay for the company overspend. Besides, their net income went from a $172 million loss in 2016 to a trailing-12-months $311 million profit. I fail to see why critics find fault in that.
Statistically, SQ has a price-to-sales ratio of 15x, which is is four points higher than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and nine points lower than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). It is not outrageous by any means, even if the price-to-earnings ratio is 382x. Once again I stress the fact that “cheap” is not what investors should seek in a growth stock. Just ask those who shorted Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a decade on that notion. Shorting a high P/E for companies like this is a recipe for disaster for the bears.
Only time will tell if they’re worth the effort. Meanwhile, investors should give them the benefit of the doubt. We circle around to the original question if it’s appropriate to buy the stock now, the answer is yes. However, investors have to acknowledge the potential for 10% dips in such a steep rising wedge chart. Therefore, it is definitely not appropriate to take a full-sized position all at once. I would prefer to buy it on dips.

Leave Room for Error
If I use options, I can do that now and leave room for error. For example, an investor can sell the Feb $185 put and collect $2.5 per contract. This means that they would retain maximum profits even if the stock falls 25% from current levels. The break-even on such a trade would be $182.5 per share.
Buying shares in a stock requires homework, and a thesis. From those two elements, investors gain conviction. In this case, I am confident that if the markets are higher in the future, Square stock will be leading it. I am absolutely not confident that I would be picking the perfect entry point if I buy it today.

2020-12-27,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From interest rates to fashion, pandemics in the past — like the Black Death in the 14th century — have left deep imprints on economic life. This time may be no different. In the aftermath of the coronavirus, governments can reimagine capitalism by giving all of us a stake in the most valuable byproduct of our day-to-day living: data. But make no mistake. It will still be a Faustian bargain. A global data profit will be a very different GDP from gross domestic product. The case for technology companies to share it with we, the people who supply them the bits and bytes, is compelling. In fact, it could even emerge as a better universal basic income — another revolutionary concept whose time may have come — for the post-Covid world.A state-provided allowance can improve citizens’ well-being, a widely studied Finnish experiment has shown. Yet only a small group of developed countries would even have a chance of sustaining a meaningful subsidy, provided taxpayers agree. Most developing nations would balk at the expense. Inequality between the global North and South would worsen.This is where a share of global data profit for the 63% of the world population that’s already online could prove helpful. The FANG quartet — Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. — garners $140 billion in combined operating earnings. China’s BAT trinity of Baidu Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. hauls in another $50 billion. Throw in device makers like Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Xiaomi Corp., payment processors like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., and Paypal Holdings Inc., and the available profit pie of our data overlords is at least $350 billion. Their combined revenue is in excess of $1.3 trillion.The arrival of 5G telecommunications networks and Internet of Things, plus rapid growth of new-age fintech players like China’s Ant Group Co., India’s Jio Platforms Ltd., and Southeast Asia’s Grab Holdings Ltd. and Gojek, will see the industry’s profit exceed $1 trillion well before the end of the decade. Even now, governments shouldn’t mind tapping companies that for the most part did well out of the pandemic to put some extra money in the hands of citizens left poorer and jaded by it. The problem is that Big Tech is notorious for moving profits to where they’re taxed least. There has to be a better way to take it back from them. One powerful suggestion has come from Columbia Law School Professor Katharina Pistor. In a recent paper, she argued that it will be useless for us, as information producers, to get authorship rights on our individual raw data. They have very little value. Yet, when algorithms analyze billions of data points, they glean insights about our behavior. Big Tech shares the intelligence for a profit with providers of goods and services, who then use the knowledge to influence our choices as consumers and make a further gain.Instead of being participants in a free market, this power game makes us victims, twice over.  No notice-and-consent privacy law or antitrust regulation can improve our bargaining position. We need partial ownership not of the data, but the databases. Put another way, if technology has made it our destiny to be “ruled by data,” then we must have rights in a depository trust of data. Pistor explains:This trust would have a right to a share in the earnings the company derived from the data and would have the task of channeling these earnings to the data producers. The trust would also exercise voting rights on behalf of the data producers.The argument hinges on debunking a popular myth: Our information footprints, the professor says, are not oil, or anything resembling a regular commodity or asset. Beyond seeking protection against hacking, the technology industry hasn’t relied on legal protection to assert its property rights. It has simply captured data as “res nullius,” or wild animals, and enjoyed supernormal profits. It’s time governments ended the ambiguity over ownership, and gave data the status of “res communis,” or community property. This is what a depository achieves. To be sure, no governments are actually considering this yet. But imagine the shakeup to power in Big Tech and people’s sense of ownership in society if political authorities tried to resolve what University of Westminster sociologist Christian Fuchs sees as a Marxian “antagonism between digital commons and digital commodities.” There are two questions. First, how would the depository pass on pro-rated dividends it receives from harvesters to producers? Second, would China come on board with the plan, or would this profit sharing end up being a permanent drag only on Western tech?The answers may be interlinked. The last-minute quashing of Ant’s initial public offering and the regulator’s order that the fintech behemoth return to its roots as a payment services provider have been the strongest signal yet of Beijing’s intention to rein in the rising power of its data czars. But that’s not the end of it. Eventually, all major central banks will issue widely distributed digital currencies, emulating an experiment already under way in China. The anonymity of cash will disappear sometime during the decade. It’s conceivable, therefore, that dividends from data depositories could simply hit official digital currency wallets on our mobile phones. In the process of spending, we’ll be leaving a data trail for central banks.Europe after the Black Death was hit by a wave of “life is short” consumerism. After this year’s trauma, we, too, are yearning for a vaccine and a more carefree 2021. But can we, as producers, consumers, and people, ever be fully rid of the scars? Even if we want to forget, will governments let us drop our guards? The rise of contact tracing during the pandemic has introduced us, willingly or otherwise, to the idea that our smartphones can keep us safe — by spying on us.Sacrificing some more of our freedom to eternal state surveillance could become a deal with a devil we’re growing to know only too well. We’ll take it, but only if technology gets us a real stake in 21st-century capitalism in return.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

But don’t be fooled. Ethereum looks set to break out in 2021. As its technological advantages gain steam, Ethereum investors could see $1,500 in the near term and $2,500 sometime by the end of 2021. But strap on your seatbelt and hold on tight; it’s going to be a wild ride.
Summary:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Ethereum sits on a superior technology.
ETH has greater room to grow.
Volatility will remain high.
Ethereum 2021: Better than Bitcoin
The future of ethereum wasn’t always so bright. In June 2016, the infamous DAO Hack sent $55 million of ether into hacker’s hands. And a rash of bitcoin clones like bitcoin cash and dogecoin made ethereum look like yet another shiny bauble in a massive cryptocurrency soup.

But ethereum quickly recovered. To handle the DAO Hack, the ethereum community decided to effectively roll back its blockchain to undo the damage. It regained its #2 position by 2018.


					10 of 2020's Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks				

Ethereum holds several technological advantages over its older bitcoin and altcoin siblings. Firstly, the cryptocurrency acts more like a contract than a coin. That makes it more like Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Wallet or Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay, rather than a $100 bill. For instance, an e-commerce buyer might hold ETH in an escrow that automatically releases payment on receipt of goods. Bitcoin, on the other hand, offers no such mechanism.
Secondly, ethereum solves the thorny problem of speed. While bitcoin takes about 15 minutes to complete a transaction, ETH will do the same in under 15 seconds.
Finally, it has a theoretically unlimited supply, unlike bitcoin’s 21-million-coin cap. That means ETH won’t run into a mining “wall” and run out of coins to reward miners.
Up, Up and Away
That makes ethereum one of my favorite cryptocurrency plays of 2021. With a $132.5 billion market capitalization, the cryptocurrency is still only one-fifth the size of bitcoin. And as adoption spreads on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and other payment processors, the forgotten middle child could quickly catch up to its older brother.

But just like bitcoin, there’s a wrinkle to the ethereum story. Unlike gold or bonds, ethereum is NOT a safe-haven asset. Instead, it’s a “risk-on” asset that tends to rise when times are good and fall otherwise.
The data backs this up. The correlation between ethereum and the S&P 500 now sits at 64%, meaning that stocks explain almost two-thirds of ethereum’s monthly returns.
Not convinced? Consider March 2020, the month the stock market fell out of bed. As the stock market tumbled 30% on coronavirus fears, cryptocurrencies provided no cushion. In a matter of weeks, bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies lost over half of their value. (The same pattern happened during the December 2018 market wobble.)
But there is a silver lining: Ethereum also tends to magnify stock market gains. With more fiscal stimulus on the way, that also means higher stock valuations. Cryptocurrencies will naturally follow.
How High Can Ethereum Go?
Make no mistake: Ethereum is as volatile as a moody teenager. $10,000 invested in January 2018 would have melted to $830 in a year. But the same $10,000 invested in January 2020 would have rocketed to $85,000. Without an underlying hard asset, ethereum’s value has no basis in the real world.

That makes the cryptocurrency’s valuation more of a popularity contest than a technical exercise, at least in the short term. The cryptocurrency could easily double to $2,500 in 2021 if more users keep jumping on board. But it could also crash to $500 if a major hack shakes investor confidence. (More likely, a 25% loss would cause investors to panic-sell, sparking a self-fulfilling downward cycle.)
Ethereum prices also tend to reverse course in the near term. Since 2015, ethereum returns have doubled-back almost 60% of the time, when a winning month gets followed by a losing one and vice versa. Even in its 2018 peak, the coin never notched more than two consecutive months of gains.
Don’t Miss the Forest for the Trees
However, like a maturing middle-child, ethereum is starting to find its footing. Since April, Ethereum has only notched one losing month. And despite its huge 2020 run, the cryptocurrency still trades 16% below its all-time peak in 2018. (Bitcoin, meanwhile, is up about 110%.)
Plenty of troubled middle-children eventually became stars. Warren Buffett and Bill Gates both overcame early stumbles. And ethereum, with its superior architecture, could one day become a staple of payments processing. Its ability to complete transactions within seconds (versus bitcoin’s minutes) makes it a viable alternative to Visa (NYSE:V) and other online payment processors.
In short, don’t miss this boat. If the broader cryptocurrency market has a good 2021, you can be sure ethereum will have an even better one.

Visa earned $3.00 billion, and sales totaled $4.84 billion in Q3.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Visa's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q4, Visa posted an ROCE of 0.09%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on VReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Visa, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q4 Earnings Recap Visa reported Q4 earnings per share at $1.12/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.1/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 10 Information Technology Stocks With Unusual Options Alerts In Today's Session  * 10 Information Technology Stocks With Unusual Options Alerts In Today's Session(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-27,"On Thursday, January 28, Visa (NYSE:V) will release its latest earnings report. Here is Benzinga's outlook for the company. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on Visa management projections, analysts predict EPS of $1.28 on revenue of $5.53 billion. In the same quarter last year, Visa announced EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $6.05 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the ""consensus estimates""; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an ""earnings surprise"", which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. View more earnings on V If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, EPS would have fallen 12.33%. Sales would have fallen 8.66% from the same quarter last year.

2021-01-27,"Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) and Visa Inc (NYSE: V) are likely to generate cross-border revenue short of the Street expectations, given that rising COVID-19 cases, the pace of vaccine rollout and the government response to the situation are weighing on demand for international travel, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Payments Analyst: Josh Beck downgraded both Mastercard and Visa from Overweight to Sector Weight. The analyst raised the Mastercard price target from $325 to $345 and reduced Visa's from $225 to $210. The Payments Thesis: Consolidation has reduced the number of processors, and cloud evolution is “giving rise to a growing number of players on the edges focused more directly on consumers, merchants, and/or banking relationships,” Beck said in an industry note. “Visa and Mastercard (payment volume) trends through November generally indicated a gradual moderation since early September,” the analyst said. Referring to 2021 prospects, he said investors should “expect robust domestic spending trends to be offset by weak x-border trends leading to in-line to slightly below results. Expect limited guidance with a focus likely to be on QTD trends, which we expect have moderated slightly from prior November updates with continued travel headwinds.” Beck lowered the 2021 earnings estimate for Mastercard from $8.35 per share to $8 per share and for Visa from $6.75 per share to $6.50 per share.

2021-01-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Infosys Ltd. will accelerate hiring in the U.S. and Europe, after Trump-era immigration curbs forced the Asian tech-services giant and its rivals to overhaul their traditional reliance on serving global clients with Indian talent.Asia’s No. 2 IT services company has recruited 2,000 college graduates outside of India in the past 12 months and will only hire more over the next year, Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh told Bloomberg Television. That’s despite expectations that President Joe Biden will adopt a more relaxed view on immigration in general than his predecessor.“We’ve taken a localization approach,” Parekh said in an interview. “That helps us build a more resilient approach for the future which can work for different policies, different scenarios. That’s our hope. As new policies emerge, we have the building blocks which can work in multiple scenarios.”Infosys, larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and their American peers have long warned immigration barriers would undermine a business model used to supply highly skilled talent to clients from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Key for the tech industry are H-1B visas used by workers from India and other countries to fill vital roles.The visa system was conceived so companies could hire overseas workers to fill a shortage of high-skilled talent in technology services and product development. The fact that Indian outsourcers collect a substantial share of the visas each year has made the program controversial, with critics arguing that companies abuse the system by replacing American workers with cheaper foreign labor.While the bulk of Infosys’s recruitment remains in India -- with 15,000 grads enlisted over the past 12 months -- Infosys is laying the foundation for more hiring abroad at a rapid clip. It’s built six research centers from Rhode Island to Indiana, which will act as magnets for American talent, Parekh said.Read more: Trump Visa Freeze Endangers India Tech Industry’s Talent ModelFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Infosys CEO to Quicken U.S. Hiring Even After Trump Departure

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 8.72%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.

2021-01-28,"Shares of Visa (NYSE:V) moved higher by 4.80% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Visa has. Visa's Debt Based on Visa's balance sheet as of November 19, 2020, long-term debt is at $21.07 billion and current debt is at $3.00 billion, amounting to $24.07 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $16.29 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $7.78 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Visa's $80.92 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.3. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

Fiscal First Quarter 2021 Financial Results
2021-01-29,"On Thursday, Visa (NYSE: V) reported the first set of quarterly results for fiscal year 2021.  In its earnings release for Q1, Visa CEO Alfred Kelly said that the company's performance ""reflected solid results and a continued positive momentum in a challenging COVID-19 environment.""

2021-01-29,"Visa Inc. outperformed quarterly earnings and revenue expectations as the credit card company benefited from consumers shopping online during the holiday season. Visa’s (V) total revenue in the fiscal first quarter slipped 6% to $5.7 billion year-on-year, topping analysts’ expectations of $5.52 billion. The global payment company stated that the drop was due to cross-border volume, which was partially offset by growth in payments volume and processed transactions. Visa earned an adjusted $1.42 per share in the reported quarter versus $1.46 a share in the year-earlier period. Analysts had been looking for $1.28 per share. In addition, the company’s board approved an $8 billion share buyback program, taking total funds available for stock repurchase to over $11 billion. “Our performance in the fiscal first quarter reflected solid results and continued positive momentum in a challenging COVID-19 environment. We saw sustained strength of debit and eCommerce volumes as well as resilient domestic spending in most countries,” Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly, Jr commented. “We continued to deliver robust Visa Direct transaction growth and accelerated our value-added services revenue – all reflective of our progress in the enablement of money movement globally.” Payments volume for the three months ended Dec. 31, increased 5% year-on-year, while total cross-border volume fell 21% in the quarter. Following the earnings results, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $250 price target. “With slow but persistent improvement in higher-yielding cross-border travel, continued momentum in e-commerce, and higher adoption of credit cards in brick-and-mortar, we believe both V [Visa] & MA [Mastercard] remain highly attractive as the global economy reopens in 2021,” Dolev wrote in a note to investors. “Our work points to accelerating card penetration and a boost to US volume growth. We believe the long-term stability and V's best-in-class terminal margins (along with MA) should merit a mid-teens revenue multiple.” (See V stock analysis on TipRanks) The rest of the Street is firmly in line with Dolev’s bullish outlook with a Strong Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 19 Buys versus 3 Holds. With shares up about 9% over the past three months, the average analyst price target of $235.95 implies upside potential of another 19% over the coming year. Meanwhile, TipRanks' Hedge Fund Activity tool shows that confidence in V is currently negative as 37 hedge funds decreased their cumulative holdings in the stock by 339.5K shares in the last quarter.

The Visa Analysts: Josh Beck of KeyBanc Capital Markets maintained a Sector Weight rating on Visa, while James Faucette of Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight rating with a $233 price target. The Visa Thesis: Visa delivered a solid performance despite challenging macro conditions, backed by strength in the International and Service segments, Beck said in the KeyBanc note. Cross-border data was encouraging, although management did not provide guidance for fiscal 2021 and “commentary suggests it is too early to depict a trend based on recent restriction uncertainty,” the analyst said. View more earnings on V The commentary also suggested that Visa’s second-quarter gross revenue growth may be flattish year-on-year, “with the most improvement driven by international revenues,” he said. Faucette said Morgan Stanley's biggest takeaway from the report was a change in Visa's tone. “While commentary around near-term volume trends remains cautious, mgmt spoke of keeping their current schedule of pricing increases and bring back expenses,” the analyst said. “While headwinds from social distancing measures and travel restrictions persist through Jan, we remain optimistic about the long-term growth of the business.” V Price Action: Visa shares were down 1.98% at $194.29 at last check Friday.

2021-02-04,"Visa Inc (NYSE: V) is teaming with Boston-headquartered OneUnited Bank, the nation's largest Black-owned bank, on a campaign designed to mitigate the racial wealth gap. What Happened: The new OneTransaction Campaign will encourage Black families to select one financial goal to accomplish in 2021 while providing strategies for achieving that goal. That transaction could range from improving a credit score, setting up an investment portfolio or an automatic savings account, taking out a life insurance policy or writing a will. The campaign will culminate with a virtual financial conference held on June 19, the Juneteenth holiday, featuring experts in business and personal finance, including Washington Post personal finance columnist Michelle Singletary, ""Shark Tank"" star Daymond John and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and radio talk show host Karen Hunter. The conference is free but requires reservations for attendance. Why It's Important: In announcing the campaign, the companies highlighted Brookings Institution research that determined the typical net worth of a Black family is $17,150 compared to $171,000 for a White family. ""Prioritizing financial educational and tailoring solutions to close the financial disparities is key to building generational wealth,"" said Mary Ann Reilly, senior vice president of North America marketing at Visa. ""By partnering with OneUnited Bank, we are both working towards driving lasting systemic change and enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive."" The racial wealth gap for each family can be closed by one strategic transaction, said Kevin Cohee, chairman and CEO of OneUnited Bank, which is also the nation's only Black-owned digital bank. ""By encouraging our community to accomplish One Transaction in 2021, we can make financial literacy a core value of the Black community and create generational wealth."" Visa's Equity Push: The OneTransaction campaign is the latest endeavor by Visa to address racially driven economic disparities. Last November, the company started the Visa Economic Empowerment Institute to promote equitable global economic empowerment of individuals, businesses and societies. In December, the Visa Foundation announced it would provide nearly $5 million in grants to nonprofit initiatives focused on encouraging minority-owned small- and midsized-businesses.

2021-02-05,"Cautious investors may be nervous about buying into Square (NYSE:SQ) at today’s prices. Square stock has surged almost five-fold since April. But, as long as its growth story stays in motion, expect valuation concerns to remain secondary. Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Why? Chalk it up to the strong performance of its customer-facing Cash App business. Now making up two-thirds of its revenue, this platform has moved beyond just peer-to-peer payments. The platform has found success offering trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin (CCC:BTC). Its recent move into stock brokerage services has shown success as well, and could benefit from the recent controversy surrounding Robinhood.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What about Square’s Seller Ecosystem (point of sale, Square Capital) segment? As seen in its last quarterly results release, this unit has continued to grow, albeit moderately. But this could pick up going forward. Why? The “digitalization of payments” megatrend (more below) could start to accelerate post-Covid. In addition, this segment could perform better than expected, if we get over the pandemic in the coming year. 8 Biometric Stocks to Consider as We Eye a Return to Normal The Cash App segment may be getting the most attention. But, the Seller Ecosystem remains an important part of this fintech supermarket. Of course, it’s not guaranteed that good times will continue for Square stock. Given its frothy valuation, shares could see a downsized pullback if the stock market starts heading in the wrong direction. But, outside of general market risk, there’s little on the horizon to make this “story stock” fall out of favor with investors. In short, a good chance shares continue to trend higher. Square Stock, and the Runaway Success of Cash App The future looks bright for Square, thanks to the runway success of its CashApp segment. As InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier discussed Jan. 29, CashApp has delivered triple-digit growth in the past three quarters. We have yet to see results for the quarter ending Dec. 31. But it looks likely we’ll see a fourth consecutive quarter of blockbuster results. Like I said above, it’s more than just peer-to-peer payments that’s fueling growth for CashApp. The company has also found success with its crypto and stock trading services. With the controversy surrounding Robinhood after the GameStop (NYSE:GME) “short squeeze saga,” CashApp’s brokerage growth could speed up, as longtime Robinhood users move over to this other retail-friendly platform. On the other hand, there’s no guarantee there will be a mass exodus from Robinhood. In fact, there’s evidence that all the attention surrounding the GameStop affair has helped to increase downloads of the popular retail brokerage app. Yet, this possible outcome played a role in Mizuho Securities’ latest “buy” rating on Square stock. Mizuho’s analyst team is not only bullish on CashApp’s prospects, but also the potential of its overlooked Seller Ecosystem unit. Speaking of this unit, there are two potential developments that could improve its results. Both in the coming year, and throughout the 2020s. Why Digitalization of Payments Will Boost Its Legacy Business The past year has been a banner one for Square. However, far from just seeing a short-term boost from pandemic-related tailwinds, the long-term appears bright as well for Square. Analysts at Cowen recently broke down how the “digitalization of payments” megatrend is set to accelerate in a post-Covid world. In other words, the eventual move to entirely cashless transactions. This may mostly benefit Square’s fintech rival, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), as well as legacy payment giants like Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V). But, Square stands to gain from this as well. Large companies may be early adopters of all-cashless point-of-sale transactions. But, over time, smaller businesses like restaurants will likely make this shift as well. Besides this longer-term catalyst, there is also the Covid recovery factor to consider as well. InvestorPlace Senior Investment Analyst Luke Lango mentioned this on Feb. 1, when he made the case why Square stock is headed to $300 per share. In short, as in-person businesses like restaurants and retailers get back to normal in 2021, the Seller Ecosystem segment should see a strong performance over the next few quarters. Outside of a Market Crash, Shares Could Continue to Climb In my book, Square looks overvalued. All it will take is one hiccup for this top -performing stock to reverse course. Yet, so much remains on its side. Outside of an overall market correction/crash, I don’t see shares heading lower anytime soon. Instead, as more positive news comes out (such as its upcoming Q4 earnings release), Square stock will likely head towards higher price levels. Tread carefully, but this remains a solid opportunity for growth-minded investors. On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a LONG position in bitcoin.

It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. View more earnings on V Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For Visa, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies. Q1 Earnings Recap Visa reported Q1 earnings per share at $1.42/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.28/share.

2021-02-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase this week sent the cryptocurrency soaring to a record, with many of its most vocal adherents feeling validated in their “to the moon” predictions. For the largest U.S. banks, prospects for the digital asset are decidedly more earthbound.Top lenders still mostly shy away from crypto. While futures contracts based on Bitcoin and Ether, the second-largest digital currency, are available at major exchanges, none of the six biggest U.S. banks offer their customers access.Their reticence should come as no surprise: Banks weren’t invited to the crypto party in the first place.“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for the person or people who developed Bitcoin, wrote in the 2008 white paper that helped lay the groundwork for the digital asset.There are other reasons banks are still mostly on the sidelines. While Bitcoin is now more than 11 years old, there are very few things it can actually buy. And volatility is a major risk, as even Tesla said in a filing disclosing its purchase.Here is crypto’s state of play at the top U.S. banks:JPMorganJPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. bank, is the furthest along.The firm last year agreed to take on Bitcoin exchanges Coinbase Inc. and Gemini Trust Co. as banking clients, breaking with an industry that had routinely forbidden Bitcoin businesses from accessing its services. The decision was meant to help virtual exchanges manage cash in the U.S., but the New York-based bank still won’t be handling any cryptocurrency transactions.It was nevertheless quite a turnaround from 2017, when Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon famously called Bitcoin a “fraud” and threatened to fire any employee caught trading it. He later said he regretted the comments, and now says he sees many ways the bank can use blockchain technology. Here’s one: In 2019, JPMorgan turned to crypto to help speed up corporate payments using a token dubbed JPM Coin.In December, JPMorgan said it was using its custom blockchain to conduct intraday repurchase agreements totaling billions of dollars, an advance that helped persuade Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to join the new digital market earlier this year. JPMorgan was also a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a group experimenting with a private version of blockchain.Goldman SachsThree years ago, Goldman Sachs hired a crypto trader to help lead digital-asset markets, with a goal of familiarizing people in the company and as well as clients with cryptocurrencies. The firm has previously mulled whether it needs to start a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies.More recently, Goldman Sachs has played down the idea of Bitcoin as an asset class, saying wild swings in its price prove it’s not a real unit of value. At the same time, the firm has been exploring the creation of its own fiat digital token, but has said it’s very early in the process.Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley CEO James Gorman was one of the first Wall Street leaders to lend credence to Bitcoin, saying in 2017 that it was more than just a fad. The firm flirted with the idea of trading a swap-based product tied to the cryptocurrency that could give clients synthetic exposure to the coin, but it ultimately didn’t proceed.Morgan Stanley’s head of digital-asset markets, Andrew Peel, has said in recent months the bank has fielded more interest in Bitcoin from traditional financial firms.Wells FargoWells Fargo & Co. doesn’t accept crypto assets in deposit, custodial or other accounts, according to company spokesperson Roger Cabrera. The firm is, however, conducting research to “evaluate the underlying technology for potential transactional, transparency and settlement innovations it may hold,” Cabrera said.The San Francisco-based company announced in 2019 that it was piloting Wells Fargo Digital Cash as a bank-issued alternative to cryptocurrency. Wells Fargo said at the time that the internal settlement service would run on its first distributed-ledger technology platform and allow internal book transfers of cross-border payments using digitized cash.CEO Charlie Scharf has been mum on the issue since taking over in 2019, but while running Visa Inc. in 2014 he called Bitcoin “far more complex” than it’s often portrayed.CitigroupCitigroup Inc.’s outgoing CEO, Michael Corbat, said in an interview with Bloomberg in December that he believed some cryptocurrencies would continue to be used as different forms of payment, adding that his bank had begun working with governments around the world to make sovereign digital currencies.Bank of AmericaBank of America Corp.’s chief operations and technology officer, Cathy Bessant, said in 2019 that the use of Bitcoin and other digital assets was “troubling,” and that she was “bearish” on blockchain despite the lender having about 90 patents in distributed-ledger technology. “If blockchain or DLT becomes a reality, we want to be ready for our clients,” she said in an interview on CNBC at the time.Bessant said she was “trying to throw down the gauntlet” for blockchain uses, but so far hadn’t seen anything that signaled the bank would be dependent on the technology in 10 years.Payment CompaniesSome of the biggest strides have come from financial-technology giants such as PayPal Holdings Inc. and Visa.PayPal last year started allowing consumers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in their PayPal wallets -- a feature it plans to add to its Venmo app in coming months. The company will also soon allow customers to use cryptocurrencies to pay for a purchase at the 29 million merchants where PayPal is accepted.Visa has said that if a digital currency becomes a recognized means of exchange, there would be no reason why the firm wouldn’t add it to its network, which already supports 160 currencies.Looking AheadWhile Wall Street is still mostly on the sidelines, crypto could become too good to ignore if the “to the moon” crowd’s highest hopes become reality. Tesla’s $1.5 billion purchase would be worth $5.5 billion in a year based on Bitcoin’s one-year return of about 365%, or $18 billion in two years if it repeats its roughly 1,200% gain for that period.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Wall Street Stays on Crypto Sidelines as Tesla Boosts Bitcoin

2021-02-11,"(Bloomberg) -- PayPal Holdings Inc. is weighing a foray into stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as the firm pushes beyond its iconic checkout button.The payments giant expects the number of active users on its sprawling platform to climb to 750 million by the end of 2025 -- roughly double the current level -- as it expands into new areas of financial services, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said Thursday at the company’s investor day. With its latest plans, PayPal aims to become the world’s next financial super-app, akin to Chinese firms Alipay and WeChat Pay.“There’s few companies in the world that can even aspire to this vision,” Schulman said. “It requires capabilities that cross industries, from financial services to payments to shopping to technology.”PayPal is coming off a record year, when spending on its platform soared 31% as consumers turned to online shopping in droves after the pandemic shuttered stores around the globe. The firm added 72.7 million users during the year as revenue climbed to $21.5 billion.The performance came even as PayPal’s main business of speeding up the online checkout process has seen intense competition from the likes of Apple Inc. as well as payment giants Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. Still, it’s an area PayPal dominates: The firm’s button has been added to nearly three-quarters of the leading U.S. retail sites, according to a survey last year by Pymnts.com.One StopNow PayPal has set its sights on turning itself into a one-stop shop for consumers and merchants alike to conduct their finances. The firm said new products could include stock trading and high-yield savings accounts as well as bill-payment capabilities and check-cashing services.The firm’s new digital wallet will be divided into a financial services tab, a payments tab and a shopping tab, Schulman said in an interview following the investor-day event. PayPal hopes to debut the new features within the next two years.“We are doing a lot organically because our platform and our product capabilities are as robust as they’ve ever been,” Schulman said in the interview. “But we’ll also look to partner with people,” he said, adding that “we’re also looking at the potential of acquisitions where that might make sense.”The company is leaning into the success it’s already seen from adding the ability for users to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies in digital wallets in recent months. Half of all customers who took advantage of the feature now log into the app every day -- meaning PayPal has become a destination for those customers, rather than a place they turn to on an as-needed basis.Driving Revenue“This is precisely the type of engagement that we want to see as we add these additional financial services,” Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said.That’s because that sort of activity, in turn, drives revenue. Schulman said the firm now expects the average amount of revenue it collects from each user to grow substantially over the next five years.PayPal is now on track to more than double revenue to $50 billion in 2025 as payments volume on its platforms triples to $2.8 trillion. The firm also expects to generate $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years.PayPal’s shares rose 0.5% to $284.62 at 3:28 p.m. in New York, after climbing as much as 6.7% in earlier trading. The stock has increased 673% since it was spun off from EBay Inc. in 2015, compared with the 89% advance of the S&P 500 Index.PayPal has warned that some of the new initiatives caused an uptick in spending on technology and development. Such costs already rose 27% to $2.64 billion last year. Still, the firm has said it expects profits to climb 17% on an adjusted basis this year.“We really hit our stride in 2020,” Schulman said. “And I’m so excited about what we plan to deliver and what we are going to deliver in this year and in the years to come.”(Updates with CEO interview starting in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","PayPal Looks to Stock Trading, Savings in Push Past Checkout"

2021-02-19,"Although cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the investment markets, they’re also incredibly risky. I would know. Recently, I explained that I had to exit out of the Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) sector because it was too much. However, for those who are considering virtual currencies, you may be better served with blockchain stocks. First off, I simply don’t know where cryptocurrencies as a speculative vehicle will end up. That’s one of the reasons why I exited before the $50,000 target that I had previously called. Don’t get me wrong — I still believe in the continued rise of Bitcoin, and, therefore, I maintain a modest position. But I also had to get something out of this ride. Otherwise, it’d be for naught. Second, blockchain stocks represent investments in the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other virtual tokens. While I’m not 100% certain what the future of cryptos hold, I’m much more confident in the belief that the decentralized distributed public ledger system will carry on. Not only that, the blockchain will spark additional innovations in the world of fintech.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This segues into my third point: The innovation underlining blockchain stocks represents true financial connectivity and integration. For instance, bank wire transfers are slow and expensive. Moreover, they become problematic when dealing with countries that may not have the most robust economic infrastructure. We need something that’s cheap and effective, and only the blockchain has forwarded a reasonable proposal. Beyond that, mitigating or outright eliminating the friction in peer-to-peer transactions will help our own economy manage the destruction caused by the novel coronavirus. With the possibility of an extended recession, the number of individuals being forced out of the financial system may rise substantially. Therefore, only technology will solve this dilemma, which benefits these blockchain stocks to buy. 7 Overvalued Stocks Investors Just Don’t Get Tired Of As you can see from the list below, the available companies are very diverse, ranging from blue-chip giants to speculative names. Therefore, blockchain stocks offer something for everyone, irrespective of your risk tolerance. Let’s take a look: Visa (NYSE:V) IBM (NYSE:IBM) CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) SolarWorld (OTCMKTS:SRWRF) Bitfarms (OTCMKTS:BFARF) Visa (V) Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com Initially, many corporate and government institutions regarded Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as competition for the global financial system. Nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, by utilizing the blockchain innovation, blue-chip companies like Visa can offer services that meet the increasing demands of their clients. In the credit card company’s case, management developed the Visa B2B Connect platform, which processes corporate cross-border business-to-business payments in a safe, secure and predictable manner. This is huge for Visa, as virtual currencies as a concept will not be going away anytime soon. Further, Visa stock can benefit from the superiority of the blockchain technology. Basically, the platform is more efficient than other alternatives because the trust component between two parties is not handled by a human (and therefore corruptible) entity but rather, an immutable digital record. If you’re not interested in the wild swings of the cryptocurrencies themselves, stable blockchain stocks like Visa provide exposure to a relevant innovation that won’t leave you hanging. IBM (IBM) Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com When you hear the term blockchain stocks, you can’t help but think about the wild gyrations in the cryptocurrency markets. More than likely, something like IBM stock doesn’t immediately fit the profile. However, as sedate as “Big Blue” may be for some investors, it’s worth considering for safe exposure to this burgeoning technology. As you may know, the company established its IBM Blockchain platform to help enterprises and institutions deal with various challenges that extend beyond financial purposes. A brilliant example of this is the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. Thanks to the blockchain’s immutable characteristic, IBM is able to deliver real-time end-to-end traceability for vaccine distribution. While I hope that we never have to hear about Covid-anything in the future, if we do have another health crisis, Big Blue will be ready. That bodes well for IBM stock. 7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Aren’t a Gamble And like other blue-chip blockchain stocks, IBM has several other revenue channels in case the decentralized ledger doesn’t pan out. In particular, its artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity solutions are compelling under the current circumstances. CME Group (CME) Source: Marko Aliaksandr/ShutterStock.com Though not directly one of the blockchain stocks, CME Group nevertheless gave the entire digital currency complex a massive credibility boost. You see, as the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, CME offers investors the ability to trade on almost anything. With cryptocurrencies as part of its offerings, the sector is now a legitimate one. In addition, buying CME stock provides you with exposure to Bitcoin trading without having to step into the arena. In a way, owning equity in CME is the loose equivalent of selling tickets to the big game rather than betting on one team to beat the other. No, you’re probably not going to get rich off CME, but you’re likely not going to be left destitute. Further, the ability to buy Bitcoin futures and trade options contracts affords the underlying asset the constant price movements that allow day trading to occur. Overall, CME Group’s involvement in the space is positive for the digitalized economy, and it should turn out to be a good deal for CME stock too. Nvidia (NVDA) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Technically more of a crypto-mining play, I nevertheless included Nvidia in this list of blockchain stocks because mining is what makes most decentralized distributed public ledgers tick. Again, the beauty of this platform is that two parties that don’t necessarily trust each other don’t have to rely on a third-party intermediary that both may not mutually trust. Instead, the intermediary is the blockchain system itself. However, public blockchains require participation of nodes (computers) to verify transactions that occur within the system. This is where mining comes into the picture, with blockchain users competing for the right to verify such transactions and receive digital tokens as a reward. However, to win this competition consistently usually entails intensive hardware. Arguably, Nvidia provides the best processors for mining tasks, which greatly benefits NVDA stock. 7 Stocks That Elon Musk Loves — And That You Should Too Further, you don’t have to be a big believer in blockchain stocks to appreciate Nvidia. The semiconductor firm has exposure to multiple relevant businesses, including video games, machine learning and autonomous solutions. Thus, you really can’t go wrong with NVDA stock. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com If I’m going to mention Nvidia on this list of blockchain stocks, then I’m obligated to also include Advanced Micro Devices. Admittedly, this is part of self-preservation. Otherwise, I’d get a lot of heat from fans of AMD stock, and I’m already hundreds of emails behind. I don’t need any more to flood my inbox. Seriously, though, Advanced Micro more than deserves inclusion as a blockchain/crypto-mining play. In recent years, the company has been taking it to its larger rivals. Years ago, AMD was an afterthought in the broader chip-manufacturing space. Now, it’s a legitimate leader in multiple semiconductor segments, including graphics processing units (GPUs) that cater toward mining operations. Also, you may be interested to know that AMD stock could possibly be a leading indicator for Bitcoin and major altcoins. It appears that a sizable rally in AMD shares precedes robust moves in the cryptocurrency. If that’s true, I don’t see why the two assets can’t be mutually beneficial moving forward — higher interest crypto mining is generally good for both Bitcoin and AMD’s GPU revenues. SolarWorld (SRWRF) Source: Diyana Dimitrova / Shutterstock.com No, SolarWorld has nothing directly to do with blockchain stocks. And no, I haven’t lost my mind. Just hear me out for a second. Although cryptocurrencies to skeptics sound like digital fairy dust, the truth is that the process of mining these tokens require real “work.” That is, the energy needed to extract most virtual currencies require some level of sacrifice. Sure, sacrifice doesn’t necessarily give them value. However, it would be wrong to assume that crypto coins are materialized for nothing. However, as cryptocurrencies have become more popular, the energy requirements needed to extract many of these coins have become much more intensive. And this is where SRWRF stock comes into the picture. As a solar energy investment, the underlying product could potentially help make crypto mining more profitable for newcomers as it may mitigate utility costs. 9 Meme Stocks That Social Media Won't Shut Up About Using solar energy to extract cryptocurrencies isn’t a new concept. However, it could become incredibly popular now that this market has attracted mainstream attention. While SRWRF stock is a speculative trade, it’s well worth consideration with “dumb” money. Bitfarms (BFARF) Source: Shutterstock Gone are the days when you can mine Bitcoin on your laptop. As the original digital token increased in value and popularity, so too did its mining difficulty. Now, it can cost thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars to run a Bitcoin mining operation — and you’re not even guaranteed to be successful with such a cash outlay! Therefore, crypto-mining farms — or dedicated mining centers — have popped up across the world. Bitfarms is one such mining farm, and, conceptually, it’s an intriguing one. Utilizing clean and competitively priced hydroelectricity, BFARF stock represents an environmentally responsible way to mine Bitcoin. As well, the company operates five mining facilities in Quebec, Canada. Geographically, this would seem to be an advantage as the colder climate should help prevent Bitfarms’ mining equipment from overheating. You’d think that this will help extend the life of the equipment, possibly making BFARF stock a shrewd speculative idea. Nevertheless, this is a wild one, so don’t get involved with money you can’t afford to lose. On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a long position in BTC.

2021-02-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks Covid-19’s impact on trade. Sign up here, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis on the pandemic.China regained its position as India’s top trade partner in 2020, as New Delhi’s reliance on imported machines outweighed its efforts to curb commerce with Beijing after a bloody border conflict.Two-way trade between the longstanding economic and strategic rivals stood at $77.7 billion last year, according to provisional data from India’s commerce ministry. Although that was lower than the previous year’s $85.5 billion total, it was enough to make China the largest commercial partner displacing the U.S. -- bilateral trade with whom came in at $75.9 billion amid muted demand for goods in the middle of a pandemic.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned hundreds of Chinese apps, slowed approvals for investments from the neighbor and called for self-reliance after a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border, India continues to rely heavily on Chinese-made heavy machinery, telecom equipment and home appliances. As a result, the bilateral trade gap with China was at almost $40 billion in 2020, making it India’s largest.Total imports from China at $58.7 billion were more than India’s combined purchases from the U.S. and the U.A.E, which are its second- and third-largest trade partners, respectively. Heavy machinery imports accounted for 51% of India’s purchases from its neighbor.That said, India did manage to lower imports from its Asian neighbor amid demand disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The South Asian nation also managed to increase its exports to China by about 11% from a year ago to $19 billion last year, which makes any further worsening of ties with Beijing a threat to New Delhi’s export revenue.The tense relations are already weighing on India’s ambitions to bolster its manufacturing capabilities. New Delhi has been slow to issue visas to Chinese engineers needed to help Taiwanese companies set up factories under a so-called production-linked incentive program, or PLI, to promote local manufacturing.“Still a very long way to go” is how Amitendu Palit, an economist specializing in international trade and investment at the National University of Singapore, described New Delhi’s efforts to wean itself away from Beijing. “The PLI schemes will take at least four-five years to create fresh capacities in specific sectors. Till then reliance on China would continue.”(Updates with details on machinery imports in the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",China Back as Top India Trade Partner Even as Relations Sour

2021-03-04,"(Bloomberg) -- As Bitcoin’s recent surge cracked the financial world’s resistance to virtual currencies, few were better positioned to profit than Zac Prince. BlockFi, the lending startup he co-founded, added $13 billion in assets and partnered with Visa Inc. and Fidelity Investments to help their clients with crypto too.He can thank his wife and a skeptical mortgage lender.It was her patience that wore thin five years ago when Prince, who’d worked for a string of fintechs, just couldn’t stop talking about the potential of cryptocurrencies.“She started making me go to meet-ups,” he said. When the couple applied for a mortgage, he tried to list his crypto holdings as an asset -- only to trigger additional compliance checks by the lender. “They were worried I might be involved in illicit activities.”That one-two combo made Prince realize he had to start his own company. He and a new contact, Flori Marquez, co-founded BlockFi, a sort-of bank for the virtual-currency realm. It pays interest on crypto deposits and makes cash loans using those holdings as collateral.So goes the origin story of a 34-year-old chief executive officer who’s suddenly found himself in an enviable position to capitalize on the latest bout of interest in cryptocurrencies. With backing from Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, BlockFi has clocked fast growth, watching assets surge to $14 billion in February from $1 billion a year earlier. Monthly revenue jumped to $40 million from $1 million. The workforce grew to 500 from 75.And in the past few months, the lender has established itself as a partner for more-traditional companies. Last month, it also created its own Bitcoin trust to help institutions and certain qualified investors make bets.For Prince, it’s been a wild ride.“It’s like you got strapped into a rocket ship and it’s taking off,” he said. “And you’re one of the pilots and you have to know what to do with the dials.”The deals BlockFi reached with Visa and Fidelity, both in December, signaled a new openness to Bitcoin in the traditional financial industry. Since then, custody banking giant Bank of New York Mellon Corp. said it will hold, transfer and issue digital currencies. Mastercard Inc. announced plans to let cardholders transact in cryptocurrencies on its network. A Morgan Stanley unit known for picking growth stocks opened a review into adding Bitcoin to its possible bets. This week, people close to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it plans to reopen a trading desk for crypto wagers.With Visa, Prince’s company created the BlockFi Bitcoin Rewards credit card, which is expected to launch in this year’s first half. Rather than offering airline miles or cash back, it doles out Bitcoin based on purchases on Visa’s network.With Fidelity, BlockFi is helping the asset manager provide cash loans to institutional customers pledging Bitcoin as collateral.One of the significant risks BlockFi has to navigate is Bitcoin’s volatility. To avoid getting burned by swings, the firm lends at steep discounts to the collateral provided. For example, $10,000 in crypto may get a user $5,000 in cash. Another way BlockFi manages -- and monetizes -- the crypto customers provide is through the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Known as the Grayscale trade, the arbitrage opportunity has been popular with investors such as hedge funds for a while. It takes advantage of a premium the trust’s shares tend to fetch in the market, compared with the value of underlying Bitcoin held by the vehicle.Trade’s StructureHere’s one way to structure the bet: Investors can borrow Bitcoin and use it to buy a comparable number of new shares in the trust. After a six-month lockup, investors sell the shares into the market to capture the premium. That premium has averaged 17% over the past year and was as high as 40% in December -- more than enough to cover the cost of setting up the trade. Yet for the moment at least, the premium is gone and shares are trading at a discount, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.BlockFi has been using some of the crypto it holds for customers to generate revenue with the trade. In October, the firm disclosed a 5% stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.Locking up Bitcoin in Grayscale could theoretically pose a liquidity risk. But BlockFi discloses the arrangement to users and takes steps to defuse any danger, said Rene van Kesteren, BlockFi’s chief risk officer. The company keeps “a decent amount” of crypto ready for payouts, he said. And because BlockFi buys so many Grayscale shares it has an average lock-up time of three months.The extensive involvement with Grayscale prompted the company to create its own Bitcoin trust to compete with the Grayscale product. Fidelity Digital Assets will custody the Bitcoin pledged to the BlockFi trust and it will have a slightly lower fee than the Grayscale trust, Prince said.“It’s about having a more diverse and robust marketplace,” he said.For BlockFi co-founder Marquez, the startup was happenstance too. She was working for online lender Bond Street in 2017 when most of its employees were hired away by Goldman Sachs. Marquez, not wanting to join a huge bank, was able to buy the servicing entity that would manage the Bond Street loan portfolio until maturity. She found herself with a salary and nothing to do, so she started exploring new opportunities.Then she met Prince and quickly embraced the idea of building a new type of financial services firm. Her family is from Argentina, and she appreciated how crypto could enable payments to be sent home without banks in the middle.“I knew from the second I heard this idea from Zac that I needed to do this,” she said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Crypto Lender’s Wall Street Ascent Is Born of Wife’s Frustration

2021-03-10,"Visa announced that total U.S. payment volumes rose 9% in February, which is lower than the 11% growth registered in January, due to unfavorable weather conditions and a lower benefit from stimulus-related spending. While the growth rate decelerated slightly, Visa (V) said that the improvement in February's payment volumes was due to a 22% rise in Debit volumes and a 4% decline in Credit volumes. Furthermore, total cross-border volumes declined 16% year-over-year in February, showing an improvement over January's decrease of 21%. Cross-border volumes excluding intra-Europe transactions declined 26% year-over-year in February but improved from a 32% decline in January. The company said, “This improvement was due to card not present excluding travel volume growth accelerating to 27% as well as the lapping of lower 2020 travel related cross-border spend.” Global processed transactions rose 2% year-over-year in February, but were 1% lower than in January, due to adverse weather conditions in the U.S. and restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. (See Visa stock analysis on TipRanks) Visa reported better-than-expected 4Q results in January, where earnings of $1.42 per share came in ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.28. Revenues of $5.7 billion also topped the consensus estimate of $5.5 billion. Ahead of its earnings, Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat reinstated coverage on Visa stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $232 (5.3% upside potential). In a note to investors, the analyst said that she remains upbeat on Visa's earnings and sees a recovery in cross-border volumes. Overall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 13 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $242.29 implies upside potential of about 10% to current levels. Shares have gained around 16% over the past year.

Visa Technical Levels To Watch: In the short-term, 15-minute chart above, the price level of $220 can be seen as a potential key level. The level previously acted as a resistance on the chart. The stock was able to break above this level and is now trying to consolidate. Bullish technical traders may be able to see a bull flag pattern on the chart forming. The pattern comes as consolidation after a run to the bullish side. The price would have to break above the level of resistance formed by the previous few highs for the pattern to work in favor of the bulls. Bearish technical traders might be able to see a flat bottom pennant pattern. For this to work in favor of the bears, they would need the price to cross below the $220 level with some consolidation before the price potentially falls further. The daily chart above shows that the Visa stock price has been trading in a channel throughout the last year. The channel has held support near $190 and has held a resistance near $220. Bulls would like to see the price cross the $220 level with consolidation before the next move up may happen. Bears would like to see the price drop through this $190 level with some consolidation before the price has potential to drop further. Visa is trading with a market cap of $476.98 billion.

Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Boeing (BA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider What a beautiful setup we have in Boeing (NYSE:BA). I love when a stock rips higher to upside, giving us a weekly-up and/or monthly-up rotation, just as Boeing did last week. Shares went on to scream higher, topping out near $278.57 before resetting. These resets are where bulls can look for more continuation. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This nice little bull flag consolidation just tagged the 10-day moving average before bouncing on Friday. Aggressive buyers would have bought on today’s dip. More conservative traders will wait for a rotation over Friday’s high. Either way, a close below the 10-day moving average and the 61.8% retracement likely saps more momentum from the stock in the short term. If we get a rotation over Friday’s high though, this stock could be heading back to $275-plus. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Apple (AAPL) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has not shown the leadership that investors wish it would — it’s been that way for a few quarters now. The stock briefly broke out over the $138 level in January, only to lose that mark after reporting earnings (despite those earnings being really good). The stock has gone on to lose a number of key moving averages, as well as the $126 level. Notice the way the 100-day moving average went from support to resistance, most recently rejecting Apple earlier this week. So what now? Bulls need to see Apple either retest the recent low or they need to see a rotation. If it’s a rotation, I’d love to see shares clear $127.22 next week. Not only would that give us a weekly-up rotation, but it would also put shares over the key $126.75 level, as well as the 10-day, 21-day and 100-day moving averages. It would at least give bulls some type of momentum. If lower prices are in order, see how Apple handles last week’s low at $116.21 and the 200-day moving average. Below could put the November low in play near $112.50. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Visa (V) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider For years, Visa (NYSE:V) was a steady winner, grinding higher and higher as secular trends continued to propel its growth. However, the stock has been a bit choppier over the past year, as global consumption has waxed and waned. On Friday, Visa took a hit, falling back below $217.35. Into a few key moving averages now, let’s see how the stock responds. Do the 50-day and 100-day moving averages combine to support Visa and give it a bounce back over $217.50? Or are lower prices in store? If it’s the former, let’s see if it can also reclaim the 10-day and 21-day moving averages. If it’s the latter, I’d love to see a decline into the 200-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line). Below these measures puts the key 21-month moving average on deck, a level I like when it comes to the credit card companies. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Nano-X Imaging (NNOX) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider We don’t talk about Nano-X Imaging (NASDAQ:NNOX) too much, but it’s become more of a talking point over the last month or two. After back-to-back inside days, the stock is getting coiled up pretty tight. While holding its 10-day and 21-day moving averages, shares are struggling to push through the 100-day moving average. It also has a wide weekly range. On the plus side, we can use that range for added direction. Above the weekly high at $52.60, gives bulls a potential weekly-up rotation and puts NNOX over the 100-day moving average. That could put the 50-day moving average in play, followed a potential rally into the $60s. On the downside, a break of this week’s low at $44.22 could put the $40 to $42 zone on the table. Below that and the March low is possible all the way down at $32.20. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in NNOX.

2021-03-19,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into Visa Inc.’s practices regarding debit-card transactions.The department is looking into the network’s rules for routing transactions both in stores and online, according to a person familiar with the matter. Representatives for the Justice Department declined to comment.“The U.S. Department of Justice has informed Visa of its plans to open an investigation into Visa’s U.S. debit practices” and is cooperating with the department, the company said in a regulatory filing Friday afternoon. “We believe Visa’s U.S. debit practices are in compliance with applicable laws.”Last year, the department sued Visa to block a $5.3 billion deal the network had signed with Plaid Inc., saying that the combination would further limit competition in the market for online debit-card transactions. Visa and Plaid ultimately abandoned the deal.Visa shares slumped 6.2% to $206.90 Friday, their biggest one-day decline in almost a year. The Wall Street Journal first reported the investigation earlier Friday.In its suit against Visa last year, the Justice Department said Visa already possessed monopoly power in the market for online debit-card transactions, arguing that roughly 70% of such transactions in the U.S. routed over the firm’s network.At the heart of the Justice Department’s issues with Visa is the 2010 law known as the Durbin Amendment, which requires banks to include two networks on their debit cards. The idea is that merchants are then supposed to be given the choice of routing over a major network like Visa’s or the one run by rival Mastercard Inc. versus a smaller alternative such as Pulse, Star or NYCE. Those alternative networks can be cheaper for merchants.New TechnologyThat system generally works for in-store transactions. The problem, the Justice Department has said, is that Visa has created new technology that makes it harder for online transactions to be routed over alternative networks.“As a result, merchants do not use PIN networks in any significant volume to process online transactions, and instead pay higher fees to use Visa,” the Justice Department said in its lawsuit last year, referring to the personal identification numbers debit-card customers use when paying.Merchants’ complaints over their struggle to route online debit-card transactions over alternative networks has only intensified during the coronavirus pandemic, with consumers turning to online shopping in droves. Retailers already spend more than $100 billion a year to accept cards and other electronic payments, an amount that’s swelled in recent years as consumers shifted away from cash, and banks dangled rewards and perks to spur more card usage.Visa, in its response last year, argued that the Justice Department cherry-picked its definition of the online debit-card market to make it seem like the network holds more power than it does. Visa also said the department’s claim that it doesn’t face real competition from Mastercard was “dubious.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Visa’s defense against a new U.S. Department of Justice probe may be the superior security of the company’s network vs. cheaper options, which we view as a sound argument and one that Apple may invoke against Epic Games. The Visa investigation will take at least a year and could spur a lawsuit that would further delay resolution.”--Julie Chariell, senior industry analyst, and Meryl Thomas, associate analyst“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Visa said. “In recent years, Mastercard has convinced numerous banks to switch their debit-card portfolios from Visa to Mastercard and competition has driven down overall pricing on accounts.”For years, Visa has reported in regulatory filings that the Department of Justice’s antitrust division issued the company a civil investigative demand in March 2012, seeking documents and information tied to its debit-card practices.“Although it’s not clear what specifically the DOJ might be looking at currently, we believe the threat of regulation has historically proven to be a near-term multiple compressor, as was the case with the Durbin Amendment, but note the financial implications were less impactful,” Daniel Perlin, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.While Visa hasn’t received a civil investigative demand from the Justice Department yet, it did get a notice to preserve relevant documents, the company said in its filing Friday.(Updates with Visa comment in third, last paragraphs.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Visa Faces U.S. Probe Over Its Debit-Card Routing Practices

2021-03-19,"Visa Inc (NYSE: V) attracted a Justice Department (DOJ) probe for alleged anticompetitive practices in the debit-card market, the Wall Street Journal reports. The DOJ’s antitrust division probed into Visa’s possible role in restricting merchants’ ability to route debit-card transactions over cheaper card networks. The probe also inquired into in-store issues. The probe emphasized the network fees that merchants passed on to the customers in the form of higher prices. The investigation focused on Visa’s possible market domination via unlawful activities. The DOJ also questioned Mastercard Inc’s (NYSE: MA) role in the debit-card marketplace and whether financial-technology firms posed competition to Visa and Mastercard. In November, the DOJ prosecuted Visa, alleging the perpetration of Visa’s monopoly in the online debit market via the acquisition of financial-technology firm Plaid Inc. Plaid allegedly posed a threat to Visa through the development of cheaper payment technology. Visa refuted the allegations. The companies dropped the deal in January, citing litigation complexities. Merchants have for years alleged the inability to route Visa or Mastercard branded online debit-card purchases over smaller networks like Shazam or NYCE, leading to higher network fees compared to the smaller networks. The DOJ reportedly investigated Visa’s potential manipulation of routing preference via financial incentives to banks. The DOJ also probed into debit-card routing practices tied to newer payment methods, including mobile wallets like Apple Pay or conventional payment terminal. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission was also probing Visa and Mastercard over debit-card routing. Price action: V shares were trading lower by 5.06% at $209.52 on the last check Friday. MA shares traded lower by 2.42% at $358.12.

2021-03-29,"What Happened: Visa Inc (NYSE: V) has launched a pilot program to allow transactions to be settled via cryptocurrencies on its payments network, Reuters has reported. Transactions on the network will be settled via the stablecoin cryptocurrency USD Coin (USDC), whose value is directly pegged to the U.S dollar. The payments giant has partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com for the program and is expected to add more partners later this year. “We see increasing demand from consumers across the world to be able to access, hold and use digital currencies, and we’re seeing demand from our clients to be able to build products that provide that access for consumers,” said Cuy Sheffield to Reuters, head of crypto at Visa. Why It Matters: Visa’s latest move eliminates the need for cryptocurrencies to be converted to traditional fiat currency in order to settle transactions. Previously, a card holder’s cryptocurrency wallet would deposit fiat currency into a bank account which would be wired to Visa at the end of the day – something that added cost and complexity to the business. Now, digital asset bank Anchorage and the Ethereum blockchain have enabled Visa payments to be settled in cryptocurrency alone. See also: How to Buy Ethereum (ETH) Visa said that it had completed the first transaction of this nature earlier this month, with Crypto.com sending the stablecoin USDC to Visa’s Ethereum wallet address at Anchorage. Crypto.com commented on the transaction, calling it “a huge milestone for the industry as crypto and fiat networks begin to converge.” According to Eric Anziani, chief operating officer at Crypto.com, to further support this effort, Crypto.org Chain will work to support USDC issuance on its network later this year.

2021-03-31,"(Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden plans to allow a pandemic-related ban on visas for certain temporary workers, enacted by former President Donald Trump, to expire Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter.The moratorium, which affected H-1B visas used by technology companies to hire foreign coders and engineers, was imposed last June. Biden is opting not to renew it, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision hasn’t been announced. The White House declined to comment.Biden’s decision will please business groups from Silicon Valley giants to India’s IT services leaders, which had pressured the administration to lift the ban ever since the new president took office. Executives have grown frustrated that the directive was not immediately revoked, arguing it hurt U.S. companies.American tech firms, from Facebook Inc. to Google, rely on foreign talent to shore up domestic workforces. Infosys Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. traditionally dispatch Indian software engineers to work in tandem with their American clients, which include some of the largest Wall Street banks and technology corporations. It remains unclear whether Biden will ease visa restrictions in general, reversing curbs imposed by the former Trump administration.TCS, Asia’s leading software services company, rose more than 1% Wednesday, though rivals Infosys and Wipro Ltd. fell.Earlier: Biden Revokes Trump Orders on Financial Regulation, ImmigrationTrump’s restrictions on guest-worker visas, which also covered non-agricultural seasonal laborers, au pairs and others, had been under review by the Biden administration.Biden last month withdrew a related Trump executive order that stopped the issuance of new green cards, citing the pandemic -- a move that drastically cut legal immigration to the U.S. Trump had argued the policies were necessary to protect the American economy as it emerged from the pandemic-induced recession.“To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here,” Biden said in a presidential proclamation at the time. “It also harms industries in the United States that utilize talent from around the world.”The ban on guest-worker visas was not revoked at the same time. Temporary work visas are unpopular with labor unions and other worker groups who argue that they put American workers at a disadvantage to their foreign counterparts.Despite the Trump administration’s extension of the visa ban at the end of 2020, opponents of the restrictions had already found some success in court.A federal judge in California granted a preliminary injunction on Oct. 1 in a lawsuit brought by several large business groups, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The groups argued Trump exceeded his authority by imposing immigration restrictions in his June 22 proclamation.The Trump Justice Department appealed that ruling to the San Francisco-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In February, the appellate court requested a status report from the parties by April 7.(Updates with share reaction in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Biden to Let Trump’s H-1B Visa Ban Expire in Win for Tech

2021-04-08,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. antitrust investigation of Visa Inc. is scrutinizing deals the company has with banks to entice them to process more online debit-card transactions over its network -- spending that surged amid coronavirus lockdowns.The Justice Department is probing incentives Visa offers banks that route more debit-card spending through its network, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm acknowledged an inquiry in a regulatory filing last month without elaborating on the specific issues at hand.Representatives for Visa and the Justice Department declined to comment.Visa’s shares pared earlier gains to trade at $219.41 at 12 p.m. in New York, up less than 0.1% after previously climbing 1.62%.The outlines of the investigation, described by people on the condition they not be identified, show Visa faces scrutiny of a major business line, with potential repercussions not just for the U.S. financial industry but millions of stores, restaurants and other merchants across the country.“The U.S. Department of Justice has informed Visa of its plans to open an investigation into Visa’s U.S. debit practices,” Visa said in last month’s regulatory filing. The company said it would cooperate and that it believes the business is “in compliance with applicable laws.”Visa has signed deals with lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co., offering them payments or discounts that can burnish their earnings. There’s no indication banks are also subjects of the probe. As with all investigations, the scrutiny may not result in any accusations of wrongdoing.Two NetworksAt issue in the government’s inquiry, according to the people, is the so-called Durbin Amendment, passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The law required banks to put two unaffiliated networks on every debit card they issue. Merchants, then, are supposed to have the ability to choose which network handles transactions.Banks typically issue debit cards with either Visa or rival Mastercard Inc., but there’s also a bevy of smaller, lesser-known networks with names like Pulse, Shazam and Star.Alternative networks often charge a lower fee, averaging just 24 cents per transaction in 2019, compared with 32 cents for debit spending routed over Visa’s network, according to data compiled by the Federal Reserve. While the difference may be pennies, it’s all part of the more than $100 billion a year borne by merchants accepting electronic payments. Those costs are a longstanding source of frustration among retailers.In recent months, those tensions have escalated, as retailers complained they’ve noticed some banks have begun to refuse to authorize debit-card transactions over alternative networks when a consumer doesn’t use a PIN, or personal identification number.Using PINsHistorically, requiring a consumer to input a PIN for in-store transactions was doable -- customers were already used to the practice. But consumers don’t typically use PINs for online spending or mobile payments, leaving merchants with fewer options for routing in the digital world.The issue came to a head as the pandemic shuttered stores across the country and encouraged consumers to place orders online, shifting a larger share of merchants’ sales to websites.“Last year we did start hearing from some folks that as we’re seeing these cards online, they couldn’t see the second network,” Hannah Walker, vice president of political affairs at FMI, a food-industry association that represents retailers and producers. “It’s challenging because when we have competition between two networks, rates go down.”The Justice Department is examining whether Visa’s deals with banks have something to do with that phenomenon, according to the people familiar with the matter.Incentive OfferedHere’s how those deals typically work:Say a bank sends $1 billion in debit-card spending over Visa’s rails in a year. For the following year, Visa might offer the bank an incentive -- which can come in the form of a discount on fees -- if the bank sends the same volume again. If the bank sends less, the incentive will be lower. If the bank sends more, the incentive can be significantly higher.Visa, for its part, also inks such deals with major merchants and payment processors to entice them to send more volume over its network.The deals with banks were cited in the Justice Department’s lawsuit last year seeking to block Visa’s proposed takeover of Plaid Inc. Authorities accused the payments giant of trying to buy the financial-technology firm to eliminate an emerging threat to its business of handling online debit-card transactions. The government pointed to the agreements with banks as an example of Visa’s history of using contracts to block potential competitors and protect a monopoly.“Visa has inhibited the adoption of alternative lower-cost networks for online debit by disincentivizing banks from enabling the use of alternative debit networks,” the department wrote in a complaint filed in November.Takeover CanceledVisa and Plaid called off the takeover in January. While Visa vigorously contested the government’s analysis, Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly told analysts that it was clear authorities wouldn’t work to resolve the case quickly. “Therefore, we decided not to devote more time to this acquisition,” he said.In its complaint, the Justice Department said Visa handles the lion’s share of online debit transactions in the U.S., with a market share that dwarfs that of Mastercard. Visa earned about $4 billion from the overall debit business in 2019, according to the complaint.Visa has said it faces a lot of competition for online transactions, including from credit cards and Mastercard, which has won a number of debit-card portfolios from banks in recent years.(Updates with share price in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Visa’s Incentives to Banks Examined by Justice Department

Dallas Mavericks Mark Cuban also helped matters by saying that it’s closest “to a true currency.” Cuban said his portfolio allocation is, “60% bitcoin, 30% Ethereum and 10% the rest.” There is also a major catalyst coming up for ETH. For years, Ethereum developers have been planning a shift to proof-of-stake from proof of work.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Under the new concept, Ethereum 2.0 blockchain users will get rewards for helping run the network based on the amount of ETH they are willing to stake to it. In contrast, proof-of-work involves using massive amounts of computer power to solve a series of cryptographic puzzles to create a new block. The shift will lower the network’s energy use allowing the Ethereum network to process more transactions per second and reduce fees. These initiatives are part of Ethereum 2.0, an ongoing project that does not have a definitive completion date. However, Justin Drake, one of the researchers working on Ethereum 2.0, has said, “I am confident we can ship the merge in 2021.” So, things are looking up for Ethereum bulls. Ethereum Escapes Bitcoin’s Shadow For much of its life, Ethereum has played second fiddle to Bitcoin. Many mistakenly consider the two as like-for-like replacements of each other. However, Ethereum is very different from Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a virtual currency and store of value. What makes it different is that it can be used to “codify, decentralize, secure, and trade just about anything.” 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 You can build smart contracts, make regular peer-to-peer payments, and create and run applications. Bitcoin is used exclusively as a currency and store of value. Ethereum also processes transactions at a quicker pace. Finally, the launch of futures on ether is another game-changer. It gives institutional investors access to a regulated market that allows them to get exposure to price movements while also mitigating any crypto-related risks. Pros and Cons Ethereum the largest ecosystem in blockchain and cryptocurrency. A large community of Ethereum developers is constantly looking to enhance the network. Hence, it becomes the platform of choice for new and sometimes risky decentralized applications. The network also allows you to bypass third-party intermediaries. You need not worry about lawyers, banks, or financial advisors when transacting on the network. Finally, the Ethereum blockchain will become more enticing when it migrates to a new protocol. Now, with the pros out of the way, let’s also highlight some risks. Ethereum’s growing popularity is leading to a sharp increase in transaction fees. In February 2021, fees reached a record $23 per transaction. Plus, there is no limit to the number of potential Ether tokens. In contrast, there is a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin. There is an annual limit of releasing 18 million Ether per year, though, giving it a measure of protection against crypto inflation. Regardless, since there isn’t a lifetime limit, there is a danger that Ethereum will become akin to a currency compared to Bitcoin, which will retain value due to the hard limit. On balance, a lot is going in favor of Ethereum. Expect these catalysts to continue pushing it upward. But you should be mindful of the risks when investing in this one. What’s Next Interest in blockchain technology is increasing at an exponential rate. Institutions are warming up to the idea of crypto, leading to an increase in demand. The introduction of listed Ether futures is only adding to the momentum, as major hedge funds and asset managers pour capital into the digital asset while also hedging against risk. In 2020, ether volumes averaged $231 million per day. In the year thus far, the figure is averaging $2.7 billion per day. With Ether futures going live, expect volumes to keep increasing in the coming months. Bottom line? Blockchain technology is quickly gaining more acceptance among companies and institutions looking to improve business processes or use it as a transaction method. Consequently, ETH price is on a steady uptrend in the past few months. It remains above all the moving averages, which will provide it strong support as Ether continues to attain new highs. If you haven’t already, now is the right time to invest in this digital asset.

2021-04-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Mastercard Inc. dropped the most in more than a month after warning it will step up spending on new products.The company plans to invest more in data and cybersecurity products and boost spending on advertising and marketing, it said on a conference call Thursday. Expenses in the second quarter will climb by a percentage in the low 30s, it said, a bigger jump than the 11% increase analysts in a Bloomberg survey were expecting.The coming jump in costs overshadowed a surprise increase in revenue that Mastercard posted for the first three months of the year.“We think that given the positive momentum that we’re starting to see on the top line, it’s the right time for us to be stepping up on expenses,” Chief Financial Officer Sachin Mehra said in an interview.Mastercard shares fell 2.5% to $385.80 at 11:22 a.m. in trading in New York, paring this year’s gain to 8.1%, in line with the advance of the S&P 500 Information Technology Index.Revenue got a boost from a smaller-than-expected drop in overseas spending on the firm’s cards. Such transactions are often the most lucrative for both Mastercard and its rival Visa Inc. While such spending dropped 17% in the first quarter, Mastercard said cross-border volume climbed 66% in April from a year earlier. Spending on cross-border travel climbed 166% this month.After consumers spent much of last year sheltering in place, Mastercard and Visa Inc. are set to benefit as travel picks up and vaccines for the coronavirus begin to proliferate around the world. Visa on Tuesday said it has seen a pick-up in Americans visiting Mexico and certain countries in the Caribbean that have opened their borders to tourists.“This nightmare will be over at some point, hopefully soon,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Miebach said on a conference call with analysts.Better-than-expected overseas spending helped fuel a 4% jump in net revenue, to $4.2 billion, topping the $3.99 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Mastercard said overall spending on its cards climbed 10% to $1.3 trillion, helped by a 27% surge in debit volume. Results were boosted by stimulus payments the U.S. government sent directly to consumers’ bank accounts.Excluding the impact of currency swings and expenses tied to acquisitions, costs are set to rise by a percentage in the “low 20s” in the second quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, Mastercard said.“Management is opportunistically stepping up strategic investments, which combined with acquisitions will weigh on near-term estimates,” Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, said in a note to clients.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Mastercard Drops After Warning Expenses Will Climb at Least 30%

2021-05-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Fintech companies in Africa raised more capital despite the Covid-19 pandemic, standing in contrast to their emerging-market peers such as Latin America that saw a decline.The continent saw fintech funding, including mergers and acquisitions, grow to $1.35 billion last year from $1 billion in 2019, according to a report by BFA Global’s Catalyst Fund and Briter Bridges published on Thursday. While Indian and Latin American fintech companies still raised more money than those in Africa, their volumes fell from the previous year as they battled to close later-stage deals.“The numbers of pre-seed and seed deals in Africa are increasing,” the report said. “While Latin America and India are seeing a growing number of mega-deals African markets are only beginning to see a few such late-stage deals.”Africa’s growing population of 1.2 billion people, rising smartphone ownership and a drop in Internet costs are among the factors contributing to the region’s allure. Investors also see opportunity among its large unbanked population of 350 million, which accounts for 17% of the global total.Most investments on the continent flowed to Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, according to the report, which surveyed 177 startups and 33 impact investors across emerging markets.The region’s fintechs haven’t yet raised funding through an initial public offering but they have enjoyed fast growing merger-and-acquisition activity, with international companies including Visa Inc., Network International Holdings Plc and Stripe Inc. growing their interests in the region.Nigeria has especially benefited from the financial-technology boom that has put much of Africa at the cutting edge of the revolution in mobile money. In 2020, Stripe paid $200 million to acquire Nigerian startup Paystack.Flutterwave, based in Lagos and San Francisco, raised $170 million this year, becoming Nigeria’s second fintech startup with a valuation above $1 billion, after Interswitch.Read more: Pandemic Was a ‘Boon’ for African Wealth Funds Investing LocallyThough total funding for emerging-market fintech companies increased last year, it still accounts for a small portion of global investment. Of the $105 billion received by fintech firms in 2020, $76 billion flowed to the US.In Latin America, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay and Colombia made up 99% of regional fintech investment, while India, Singapore and Indonesia were the most popular destination for funds in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India netted $3 billion for fintechs alone.“After the initial shock of the pandemic wore off, many investors continued to close deals, albeit remotely,” the report said.

2021-05-12,"(Bloomberg) -- The Diem Association, a group of Facebook Inc. and 25 other companies and nonprofit groups once known as Libra, is moving its main operations to the U.S. and partnering with a bank to issue a cryptocurrency backed by U.S. dollars.The new plan includes an agreement with Silvergate Capital Corp., a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, which will issue the coin and manage Diem’s reserve of U.S. dollars, the association said Wednesday in a statement.Diem said it’s still building out a global payments network, with the idea that it could serve its own stablecoin or even central bank digital currencies if world governments decide to issue them.“It’s critical for the U.S. to foster innovation in this space. The U.S. can’t really afford to fall behind here,” said Diem Chief Executive Officer Stuart Levey. Levey said Diem’s payments network will be able to lower the cost of sending money around the world, whether it’s through a Diem-issued coin or the central-bank digital currencies that many countries are considering.Shares of Silvergate Capital jumped about 20% in extended trading after the deal’s announcement.While more straightforward to achieve, the new plans are a big comedown from the vision unveiled by the Libra Association in 2019.That June, Facebook and 27 partners announced the project to great fanfare with large ambitions. The Libra Association, as the Diem Association was then known, said it planned to launch a global stablecoin backed by a basket of currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro and others.The blowback from world governments was fierce. Even though Facebook executives said they were just one of equal partners in the association, U.S. lawmakers said its involvement gave them concerns about protecting user data or giving the already powerful company a toehold in financial services. Some lawmakers even posited that libra could be a threat to the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.Amid the criticism, the Libra Association lost some of the members most equipped to address financial regulators, including Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., and PayPal Holdings Inc. Eventually, the Libra Association decided to delay the launch of a multi-currency coin in favor of separate cryptocurrencies linked to individual countries’ money. The association also rebranded as Diem, but never received a necessary license from the financial regulator in its headquarters country of Switzerland.Now, Diem’s ambitions are tightening once again.

If those come to pass, Levey said, Diem can adjust its network to accommodate them.Diem declined to say when the pilot would launch.(Updates with Silvergate share price move in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook’s Crypto Project Reboots With Smaller Ambitions

2021-05-12,"(Bloomberg) -- The judge overseeing the high-stakes trial between Epic Games Inc. and Apple Inc. hinted at a compromise that could quell at least some of the game maker’s concerns: the ability for app developers to inform users that the iPhone maker’s virtual store isn’t their only shopping option.U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers appeared to be looking for middle ground while hearing from economists called by both companies as expert witnesses in a case that threatens to upend the multibillion-dollar marketplace for apps which run on mobile phones around the world.Epic and Apple are feuding over access to V-Bucks, the virtual currency used to buy upgrades inside of the blockbuster game Fortnite. To buy V-Bucks, Apple requires use of its own payment system that takes up to a 30% cut from developers. Epic tried to replace that system with its own, circumventing Apple’s fees and leading to Fortnite’s removal from the App Store and the ongoing trial.The judge this week questioned that Apple rule, which also blocks developers from including a link or other information in their apps to steer users away from the store to buy virtual goods elsewhere online at a discounted rate.The anti-steering policy is targeted in the lawsuit Epic filed last year alleging that Apple maintains a near-monopoly and juices profits with its App Store rules and fees. Epic is seeking to unravel those rules and pave the way for alternative payment systems.There’s more at stake than Fortnite V-Bucks. If Apple were to remove its anti-steering policy, it would likely do so for all app developers. Spotify Technology SA, Netflix Inc., and Match Group Inc. all have complained about the policy, and the major music and video streaming services have removed the ability for users to subscribe to their services from their iPhone apps altogether.Evidence in the case shows that Microsoft Corp. sought an App Store work-around as early as 2012. Representatives of the Windows software maker asked Apple if users could be allowed to subscribe to Office on Microsoft’s website, rather than inside the iPad app, to ensure a consistent user interface. Apple rejected that request despite Microsoft saying it would still pay a commission to the Cupertino, California-based company.“What’s so bad about it anyway, for consumers to have choice?” Gonzalez Rogers asked Richard Schmalensee, an economist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, who was testifying Wednesday as an expert witness for Apple in the second week of trial in Oakland, California.Apple, Epic Games Have Simple Way to Avoid Trial: Fully ChargedHer question drew pushback from Schmalensee, who highlighted the downside for Apple: a decline in its App Store “revenue stream.”The professor noted that the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2018 ruling, threw out a lawsuit that accused American Express Co. of thwarting competition by prohibiting merchants from steering customers to cards with lower fees.“If the app vendor can say, if you press this button you can buy this for less, that means the App Store can’t collect its commission,” Schmalensee said. That amounts to “undercutting” Apple’s App Store sales, he said.Sensor Tower estimates the App Store generated $22 billion in commissions last year for Apple, much of which stemmed from in-app-purchases.Gonzalez Rogers said she didn’t think the situations were “factually the same.” At real stores, customers can see signs that say they can use Visa, MasterCard and other credit card options -- unlike in the App Store. “Visual indications of options don’t exist in this circumstance.”“If Apple didn’t have these rules, would the problem be solved?” Rogers asked Epic’s economist, David Evans, who also pushed back at the compromise solution when he was on the witness stand Tuesday.“That wouldn’t eliminate the market power Apple has here, but it would certainly diminish it,” Evans said. For many apps, including game apps that don’t have alternative payment systems, “it would not be much of a solution at all,” he said.Gonzalez Rogers has been wrestling with antitrust claims against Apple’s App Store for almost a decade. An antitrust case filed by app buyers in 2011 that claims Apple’s 30% fee on developers raises consumer prices went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court before returning to her court, where it’s still pending.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple-Epic Judge Hints at Compromise in Feud Over App Store
2021-05-17,"Visa (V) and CoinZoom have joined forces to make it easy for people to spend cryptocurrencies at more than 53 million locations. CoinZoom Visa cardholders can earn between 1% and 5% in card rewards for every purchase that they make. CoinZoom Visa cardholders will have to select the cryptocurrency they want to use on the CoinZoom App. In return, Visa and CoinZoom will convert their crypto holdings into a currency accepted by the merchant. Consumers' rewards for using the CoinZoom Visa Card will depend on the number of ZOOM tokens in their accounts. Trading fee discounts are also on offer when placing trades on the exchange for people who maintain the required number of ZOOM tokens. While the CoinZoom Visa card is currently only available to U.S. customers, there are plans to make it available globally. (See Visa stock analysis on TipRanks) Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev believes Fiscal Q2, ended March 30, marks a watershed moment for Visa given accelerating U.S. payment volumes and the unfolding crypto strategy. U.S. payment volumes were up 29% in April vs. 2019 levels. “Is there more upside coming? We say yes, as F3Q's revenue guide looks overly conservative. It assumes: higher incentives, a significant deceleration in two-year stack vs. 2019, and flat Q/Q growth vs. normal trends. We are higher at +23% vs. guide of high-teens, which we view as likely still conservative,” Dolev wrote in a research note to investors. Dolev has since reiterated a Buy rating on Visa. The analyst has upped the price target to $275 from $250, implying 21.18% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 18 Buy and 3 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $267.63 implies 17.93% upside potential to current levels. V scores a 6 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system suggesting its performance is likely to align with market expectations.
