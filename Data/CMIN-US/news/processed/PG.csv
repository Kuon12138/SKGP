2019-01-07,"Why CHD and MKC Outperformed Broader Markets

(Continued from Prior Part)

## Strong financials 

Church & Dwight’s (CHD) sales have been impressive in the past several quarters. The company’s top line has increased by an average of 12.6% in the past five quarters, reflecting benefits from acquisitions and innovation. Meanwhile, other household and personal care product manufacturers have struggled on the sales front, facing increased competition and soft organic volumes.

Church & Dwight’s organic sales remained strong and increased 4.7% during its last reported quarter, driven by higher organic volumes and pricing. In comparison, Colgate-Palmolive’s (CL) and Kimberly-Clark’s (KMB) organic sales were soft, and Procter & Gamble’s (PG) and Clorox’s (CLX) grew decently.

Church & Dwight’s impressive sales growth and considerably lower effective tax rate drove its double-digit bottom-line growth. The company’s earnings have increased by an average of 19.7% in the last three quarters, beating analysts’ estimates.

## Outlook

We expect Church & Dwight’s sales and earnings growth to decelerate slightly this year as the company laps its lower tax and recent acquisitions. However, we feel good about the company’s underlying business and expect its organic sales and adjusted earnings to grow healthily despite a tough year-over-year comparison, driven by its innovative products, higher pricing, marketing investments, and cost savings. Wall Street expects Church & Dwight’s top line to rise 3.3% this year, and its adjusted EPS to grow by 8.2%.

2019-01-07,"Why CHD and MKC Outperformed Broader Markets

## CHD and MKC stock rose more than 30% last year

The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) underperformed broader markets last year, dragged down by weakness in tobacco and packaged food stocks. Household and personal care product manufacturer stocks, impacted by soft demand and input and transportation costs weighing on the companies’ financials, didn’t impress, either.

Despite the gloom, Church & Dwight (CHD) and McCormick (MKC) stock generated stellar returns and outperformed peers and broader markets considerably. Whereas McCormick stock rose 36.6% last year, most packaged food manufacturer stocks fell by a double-digit percentage rate, with Kraft Heinz (KHC), Conagra Brands (CAG), General Mills (GIS), Campbell Soup (CPB), and Kellogg (K) stock falling 44.7%, 43.3%, 34.3%, 31.4%, and 16.1%, respectively.

Similarly, Church & Dwight outperformed other household and personal care product manufacturers last year. Whereas CHD stock rose 31.1%, Procter & Gamble (PG) was flat, and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) stock fell. Clorox (CLX) had a decent year, ending it on a positive note.

## What’s behind CHD’s and MKC’s uptrend?

Despite challenges, Church & Dwight and McCormick reported impressive numbers that supported their stock. Their focus on innovation, underlying business strength, and benefits from acquisitions drove their top and bottom lines.

Given their recent uptrend, CHD and MKC don’t qualify as “value buys” at this juncture. However, we expect the companies’ improved organic volumes and pricing, new product launches, and cost-saving measures to continue to drive their sales and earnings.

## Bank of America’s target

Bank of America’s equity and quantitative strategist, Savita Subramanian, expects a decline in the S&P 500 (SPY) in 2019—compared to 2018. The catch is that she targets a level of 3,000 for SPY at the end of 2018, which actually dropped to 2,507 by the end of the year. Bank of America’s target of 2,900 for the S&P 500 for 2019 was set on November 20.

Bank of America predicts an ESP of $170 next year, which implies a PE ratio of 17.06x. According to the bank, “Earnings growth is expected to decline sharply next year, from &gt;15 percent to &lt;5 percent on a year-over-year basis. The BofA Merrill Lynch Research team is bearish stocks, bonds, and the U.S. dollar; bullish cash and commodities; and long on volatility.”

## Slower growth

Bank of America expects real US (DIA) (VOO) GDP growth of 2.7% for 2019. The bank expects the rate of growth to slow down in the second half of 2019 as the impact from the fiscal stimulus starts to fade. The earnings growth deceleration is very evident, which is a concern for market participants. Higher comparables in 2019 could be tough for companies to beat, especially given the fading benefits from tax reform.

## Inverted yield curve

Bank of America’s rates team has also forecast an inverted yield curve in 2019. A yield curve shows the yields of Treasury securities that are maturing at different times. For example, two-year securities’ (SHY) yields are usually lower than ten-year securities’ (IEF) (TLT) yields. The yield curve mainly reflects bond market investors’ expectations of the Fed’s actions and future economic conditions (SPY) (IVV).

The yield curve’s inversion and homebuilder (XHB) metrics peaking are Bank of America’s main arguments for the slowdown.

As growth slows down in the equity space, Subramanian recommends that investors turn to cash. According to the bank, “with cash yields higher than dividend yields for 60 percent of the S&P 500 already, cash becomes even more competitive in 2019.”

She also suggests buying healthcare (XLV), technology (XLK), and financial (XLF) stocks. Bank of America’s recommendations for the first quarter include Walt Disney (DIS), Procter & Gamble (PG), and AT&T (T).

2019-01-15,"Gillette, the Procter & Gamble Co. brand that for three decades has used the tagline, “The Best A Man Can Get,” is building a new campaign around the #MeToo movement, a risky approach that will be the latest test of how successfully big consumer brands can navigate tricky social movements.  The ad, created by the brand’s ad agency Grey and titled “We Believe,” opens with audio of news about the #MeToo movement, bullying and “toxic masculinity.” A narrator goes on to dispute the notion that “boys will be boys,” asking, “Is this the best a man can get?  “This is an important conversation happening, and as a company that encourages men to be their best, we feel compelled to both address it and take action of our own,” said Pankaj Bhalla, Gillette brand director for North America, in an emailed statement.",[$$] P&G Challenges Men to Shave Their ‘Toxic Masculinity’ in Gillette Ad

The Gillette brand that claims it’s “The Best A Man Can Get” this week launched a campaign around the sexual harassment movement, and with the idea of “toxic masculinity” already in the zeitgeist, the ad got plenty of response.

2019-01-18,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.

Earnings season is here. And it certainly seems like a big one. The market has rallied in 2019, with the S&P 500 already up 5%+ so far this year. So far, the earnings calendar has been favorable: financials have been the year's top stocks after solid reports from the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) last week.

Already, it's a notable change from the earnings calendar in late October and early November when even strong reports seemed to be greeted with almost indiscriminate selling. Investors simply seemed too focused on forward-looking worries about trade wars, interest rates and tariffs to be optimistic about backward-looking earnings reports.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Early indications suggest that has changed. That, in turn, sets up some optimism toward the next few weeks, when many of the market's top stocks -- and largest companies -- report. For all the noise in the market over the past few months, corporate earnings still look strong. That suggests that the earnings calendar this time around could drive a further rebound in the broad market.

But for that to be the case, earnings have to cooperate. And earnings reports next week should show whether that will be the case. Several Dow Jones Industrial Average components report, but these three look like the most important. One of the market's most widely-owned stocks will try and bounce back from a big decline. A consumer giant will try and prove that there's value in a sector that has struggled of late. And a chip giant will try and keep the bounce in that sector going.

It's a big week for the market -- one that could determine how U.S. stocks trade for the rest of 2019.

### Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Source: Shutterstock 

Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, Jan. 22, before market open

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has a key earnings report on Tuesday, but the numbers might not be the focus. JNJ stock still hasn't recovered from a 10% decline last month, when a Reuters report claimed the company covered up the asbestos in its baby powder. JNJ's market capitalization fell a stunning $40 billion in a single day -- and the stock still hasn't recovered.

Even after the declines, JNJ still has the eighth-largest market capitalization among U.S. stocks. So the response to Tuesday's report - and management commentary about the company's legal exposure - will move the entire market, not just JNJ.

The question is whether Johnson & Johnson, given multiple pending lawsuits, will even address the issue beyond a statement released at the time. Any response from the company likely will overshadow the numbers. But the lack of a response might do the same.

### Procter & Gamble (PG)

Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, Jan. 23, before market open

Consumer packaged goods stocks have struggled of late, as margin pressures at supermarket customers and growing private-label penetration have led revenue and earnings growth to slow. But Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has been bucking the trend. PG stock bounced 35% from May lows to December highs, making it one of the top stocks in the consumer space.

But PG stock has pulled back, setting up an important fiscal Q2 report on Wednesday. I've long been a skeptic toward P&G, and the recent run looks like too much. Growth remains modest at best, and the company's multiple cost-cutting efforts this decade have wrung out every dollar of expense.

  * 7 Companies Apple Should Consider Buying 



PG still looks dangerous at these levels -- and any weakness in Q2 earnings could send the stock tumbling. The gains from May lows have moved expectations higher. It remains to be seen whether P&G can meet those expectations.

### Intel (INTC)

Source: Shutterstock 

Earnings Report Date: Thursday, Jan. 24, after market close

Semiconductor stocks have benefited from the recent broad market rebound. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) has bounced about 12% off its December lows. So has chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).

For those gains to continue -- for both the sector and INTC stock - Intel earnings on Thursday afternoon need to be solid. Expectations are reasonably high, with the Street looking for 11%+ revenue growth and a 13% increase in earnings per share. Given that Intel hasn't missed consensus since Q1 2017, history suggests Intel should be able to deliver at least that type of growth.

If it does, that could be good news not only for INTC, but struggling chip plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Investors clearly are worried about a cyclical downturn in the sector. Intel can assuage those fears -- and send the entire sector higher with a good report.

I still think those rivals are the top stocks to play a rebound in semiconductor stocks. But a strong earnings report from Intel might change my mind - and drive the entire chip space higher.

As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

About long-term stocks, he once famously said: &quot;I never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.&quot;

No doubt, this focus on long-term stocks has worked out extremely well for him. Buffett is worth a staggering $81 billion. He has also done this by generally avoiding the high-growth areas of the markets, such as tech stocks.

  * 7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy Now 



OK then, in light of all this, what are some stocks to buy right now -- and to hold on to for the long term? Let's take a look at five:

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Alibaba (BABA)

Lately the Chinese economy has come under pressure as President Trump's tariffs have taken a toll. But the long-term prospects still look bright. The number of people in China's middle class is expected to hit 600 million by 2022 (this compares to the total population in the US of 320 million). In fact, according to research from Standard Chartered Bank, China is on track to become the world's largest economy next year.

A good way to play this? Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which is the largest e-commerce operator in China. Even with the slowdown in the country, Alibaba is still finding ways to keep up the heady growth. In the latest quarter, revenues spiked by 56% to $10.5 billion.

Over the years, BABA has expanded away from just e-commerce. It's as if the company has been following the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook. For example, BABA has a thriving cloud computing business. During Q3, revenues soared by 90% to $825 million.

Despite all the growth, BABA stock still is relatively cheap (primarily because the shares have taken a big hit during the market selloff). Note that the forward price-to-earnings multiples is 23X. To put things into perspective, JD.com (NADAQ:JD) trades at 40X and AMZN is at 63X.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: AT&T (T)

AT&T (NYSE:T) is certainly a company that has been durable. It helps that it has focused on businesses that provide recurring revenues. But T has also had a proven long-term track record of transforming itself, such as going from landlines to mobile.

Despite all this, Wall Street has not been too upbeat about the company. Since late 2017, T stock has gone from $39 to $30.

But I think this has set up a nice entry point -- at least for those looking for a long-term stock. The main reason is that T stock should benefit nicely from another transformation of the business: the $81 billion acquisition of Time-Warner.

With the deal, the company gets a wide assortment of entertainment assets like the WB movie studios, HBO and Turner. These businesses will bring in over $31 billion in annual revenues, with high margins.

But T has the benefit of its massive mobile footprint for distribution. And this will be key for its upcoming launch of a streaming platform, which will have three huge categories (movies, original programming and the Warner film library). As seen with the huge success of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), streaming is a strong secular growth trend as consumers want more choices and affordable prices.

Finally, T stock is trading at dirt-cheap levels, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 8.5x. There is also a juicy dividend yield of 6.7%.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Coca-Cola (KO)

With the trend towards healthier diets, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) does seem vulnerable. But it is important to note that the company has been evolving. An example of this is Coca-Cola Zero. There has also been the reinvigoration of brands like Sprite and Fanta, which include no-or-low calorie recipes.

But the company is also expanding into other drink categories. One is Smartwater, which has been a fast grower. Then there is the move into energy drinks as well as the acquisitions of Organic & Raw Trading (the developer of the MOJO kombucha brand), Tropico (the creator of various fruit-flavored beverages) and Costa (a UK-based retail coffee chain).

All in all, the strategy has worked quite well. Just look at Q3, in which organic revenues increased by 6% and sales volume was up 2%. As for profits, they came to $1.88 billion, up from $1.45 billion on a year-over-year basis.

Oh and of course, Buffett is the top holder of KO stock. He currently owns a hefty 400 million shares.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Few companies have had the staying power of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which got its start back in 1837. P&G initially focused on selling candles and soap, and the company would not reach $1 million in revenues until 1858.

Fast forward to today: PG generates about $67 billion on the top line and has a market value of $225 billion.

Granted, during the past few years, there has been issues at the company, which involved a tough fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz. Yet regardless of the drama, it looks like things are headed in the right direction. PG has been cutting costs, paring down the bureaucracy and focusing more on innovation.

The result is that PG is posting strong growth. In the latest quarter, organic sales increased by 4% (this was the highest in four years). There was strength across all the categories. As for the profits, they rose by 12% to $3.2 billion or $1.22 per share.

The dividend for PG stock is also attractive, at 3.2%. The company has increased the payout for 62 consecutive years.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Exxon Mobil (XOM)

The oil industry can be extremely volatile, as seen during the past year with crude prices. Yet Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has a diverse, integrated platform that generally provides stability. The company has extensive upstream (oil exploration, extraction and production) and downstream (marketing, refining and retail) assets.

Now it's true that when it comes to production, XOM has struggled. But the company is making progress. Keep in mind that there continues to be traction in the Permian basin as well as with offshore developments, such as in Brazil, Guyana and Angola.

In the meantime, XOM continues to crank out significant profits. During the latest quarter, they spiked by 57% to $6.24 billion. The dividend is also standout, at 4.6%. The company has raised it an average of 6.2% a year for the past 36 years.

2019-01-23,"Consumer staples giant Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) reported second-quarter numbers before the bell on Wednesday that were largely better than expected. Revenues topped expectations by about 1.5%. Earnings came in roughly 3% above expectations. Organic sales growth was above consensus. The e-commerce business was red hot. Management said that they didn't see any slowdown China. The guide was hiked.

Overall, it was a solid double-beat-and-raise quarter. PG stock rose over 4% in response. But PG stock was unable to claw its way back to the near $100 highs this stock was at in early December. Instead, the post-earnings rally maxed out short of all time highs.

Why? Valuation. Despite the strong second-quarter numbers, valuation concerns remain for PG stock. The closer this stock gets to $100 without earnings and sales heading meaningfully higher, the bigger those valuation concerns get.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Considering this is a low-single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit earnings growth company, it will take at least several quarters for sales and profits to head meaningfully higher. As such, it will take at least several quarters until PG stock is fundamentally supported at $100, meaning near term upside is capped by what is already a full valuation.

### The Numbers Were Good for PG Stock

Proctor & Gamble's second-quarter numbers were very good, and underscore that this company is not only surviving a global economic slowdown, but actually thriving where others are struggling.

Organic sales growth came in at 4%. That is much higher than the consensus expectation for 2.6% growth. It is also above the 1%-4% range which organic sales growth has hung out in for the past several years. More than that, consumer staples peer Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) reported just 3% organic sales growth in the same overlapping period. Also, whereas Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other companies have reported material weakness in China, Proctor & Gamble said China was essentially business as usual during the quarter.

Overall, the broad top-line takeaway is bullish. Many companies are seeing their growth rates fall, or are experiencing material weakness in emerging markets. Proctor & Gamble is suffering from neither. Instead, the sales growth trajectory is improving, and emerging markets aren't slowing.

The story on margins wasn't as great. Gross and operating margins both came in below consensus. But, the miss on each line was 40 basis points or less. Plus, that miss was more than made up for by a hiked full year guide.

In the big picture, Proctor & Gamble had a really good quarter. But, the stock was already priced for a really good quarter, and that's why upside from here still looks limited.

### Procter & Gamble's Valuation Is Still A Concern

A double-beat-and-raise quarter doesn't dismantle the bear thesis on PG stock, which is predicated on an overextended valuation.

From fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018, Proctor & Gamble's organic sales growth ranged from 1% to 3%, while core EPS growth ranged from -2% to 8%. On average, Proctor & Gamble was a low-single-digit organic sales grower and low-to-mid-single-digit core EPS grower. That growth profile coupled with a 20 forward multiple (the stock's average valuation over the past five years) produced sub-par returns for PG stock.

Over the past five years, PG stock has risen less than 20%, while the S&P 500 is up more than 40% during that stretch.

Clearly, a 20 forward multiple on a low single revenue growth and low to mid single digit earnings growth profile didn't cut it for PG stock over the past five years. Considering rates are only going up and the global economy is only slowing, such a combination won't cut it for PG stock over the next five years, either.

Unfortunately, PG stock today is defined by a very similar dynamic. Organic sales growth this year is expected at 3%. Core EPS growth is expected at 5.5%, and that's a three year low. Thus, over the next five years, a reasonable estimate for PG's growth profile is low-single-digit revenue growth and low-to-mid-single-digit EPS growth, the same as it has been over the past five years. Meanwhile, the forward P/E multiple today is just a hair below 20, nearly identical to where it's hovered over the past five years.

Thus, PG stock today is very similar to its &quot;average self&quot; over the past five years. That &quot;average self&quot; resulted in 20 points of under-performance relative to the S&P 500. As such, there really isn't much reason to get excited about PG stock here.

### Bottom Line on PG Stock

Proctor & Gamble is a great company with solid and defensive fundamentals. The company isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and steady earnings growth is almost a guarantee.

But, today's valuation already accounts for all those positives. Upside in PG stock from here in any time frame looks limited. As such, the post-earnings rally isn't anything to get too excited about.

Obviously, the biggest concern that most Americans have is the government shutdown. Due to an extremely frustrating Washington gridlock, the impasse has no end in sight. At the moment, it appears the State of the Union address will be postponed after President Donald Trump threatened to host an &quot;alternative&quot; event.

No matter where you stand on the political issue, we can agree on this much: it's a treacherous time to invest in the markets. Even the best stocks will suffer should the shutdown last two months or longer. It's not just about the gridlock. Heading towards the 2020 election, our nation will likely become dangerously divided.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In other words, we should expect many more government shutdowns in the future.

Given the immediate controversy, we forget that we have geopolitical concerns. The China trade war weighs heavily on our economy. So too do rising tensions in the Middle East and a militarily aggressive Russia.

Still, one trader's bear is another one's bull. Although difficult to navigate, the best stocks to invest in may potentially advantage the current negativity. Moreover, the broader selloff that transpired since last October presents us with discounted opportunities.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



To be sure, investors should proceed with caution. But if you have a steady hand, here are 10 of the best stocks to buy in February:

### Procter & Gamble (PG)

Last year, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) represented an easy choice. When investors get jittery over deteriorating economic conditions, go secular. As such, few options are better than PG stock. The underlying company produces essential home goods that you can't put off indefinitely.

Turns out, the same thesis that worked in 2018 is moving the needle in 2019. On a year-to-date basis, PG stock is up 3%. This is mostly due to a favorable result for the company's second-quarter earnings report.

Procter & Gamble delivered a convincing beat on both the top and bottom line. Particularly impressive was how the iconic firm got there. Raising prices due to higher commodity and transportation costs had no net-negative impact. Instead, multiple segments, such as its healthcare division, experienced strong organic growth.

When in doubt, PG usually represents one of the best stocks to invest in. But it's good to know that current fundamentals justify the enthusiasm.

### Home Depot (HD)

Like Procter & Gamble, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) typically is one of the best stocks to buy during periods of uncertainty. While HD stock does its best work when everyone is working, certain functions, like renovations and repairs, cannot be avoided.

The company also has another, unexpected benefit: the implosion of a key competitor. As you are undoubtedly aware, Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) has suffered an ignominious fall from grace. While the bankrupt retailer is barely clinging onto life, the majority of analysts believe it's too little, too late.

However, this sorry situation favors Home Depot, and by logical deduction, HD stock. The primary reason why shoppers tolerated Sears' existence was their appliances, parts and repairs business. Outside their automobile centers, Home Depot can pick up the additional revenue opportunities.

Plus, the October selloff has made HD stock much more attractive.

### Tyson Foods (TSN)

While this may sound cynical, I want to speak honestly but respectfully: the ongoing government shutdown highlights the importance of having secular companies in your portfolio. No matter how you look at it, names like Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) are sheltered from the gridlock's most devastating blows.

Obviously, people need to eat. When push comes to shove, food expenditures become a top priority. We've heard heartbreaking stories about essential government workers picking up odd jobs to make ends meet. Also, local food pantries face a significant supply constraint. This partially explains why TSN stock has gained significant steam over the trailing month.

But the overriding catalyst is that Tyson Foods is a fundamentally sound organization. It has a stable balance sheet, consistently-positive free cash flow, and rising net margins. In addition, its top-line sales are picking back up after recent disappointments.

Currently trading at only 10 times forward earnings, TSN stock is undervalued.

### VF Corporation (VFC)

Usually under a bear market, you don't fish for the best stocks to invest in within the retail sector. This is especially true during a dubious, record-breaking government shutdown, when personal funds logically shift towards the essentials.

That said, I must give VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC) its proper dues. Known for its brands such as Vans and North Face, VF stock jumped on a surprisingly strong Q3 earnings report. Along with a resounding beat on profitability, the company came up big in top-line sales, ringing up $3.91 billion against a $3.75 billion consensus target.

Against January's opener, VFC stock is up over 18%. Understandably, cautious investors may be hesitant about buying into such strength. However, it's important to note that international sales have performed well despite the China trade war.

With such rabid enthusiasm during a tough period, VFC clearly belongs among the best stocks to buy in February.

### National Grid (NGG)

If you're looking strictly for safety, you can either put money in the bank or stuff it under the mattress. However, if you're seeking some growth while enjoying reasonable protections, utility companies are among the best stocks to invest in.

While several options exist in this sector, National Grid (NYSE:NGG) stands out for a number of reasons. Primarily, we've got to talk about that dividend yield. At nearly 6%, NGG stock deserves consideration merely for that payout.

Another positive factor is its technical stability. After suffering a tough loss last year, NGG stock is making amends this year. Since the beginning of January, shares are up over 8%.

Looking ahead to the rest of 2019, I expect National Grid to build on its momentum. For one thing, people expect the lights to turn on when they flip the switch. Further, NGG, despite its name, features some international exposure with its U.K. business.

### NextEra Energy Partners (NEP)

Despite utility companies representing the best stocks for protection during downturns, they're not entirely risk-free. Commodity and energy prices have fluctuated significantly over the past several years. Moving forward, they're vulnerable to sudden changes, which makes investing in &quot;traditional&quot; utility firms sometimes adventurous.

For those who want an ideal balance between passive income and future stability, you should consider NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE:NEP). An offshoot of NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), NEP stock represents the corporate umbrella's clean-energy expansion strategies. NEP specializes in wind and solar energy, as well as natural-gas pipelines.

While I personally am skeptical about the renewable platform's economic viability, so far, NEP stock has proven me wrong. Shares managed to return a small profit despite taking a big hit in the last half of 2018. Moreover, NEP's energy diversity may present a tailwind if oil prices move unfavorably.

Finally, you can't ignore the company's generous 4.3% dividend yield.

### Lockheed Martin (LMT)

To my surprise, defense firms were not among the best stocks to invest in last year. In fact, they were among the worst performers. Unfortunately, this was a situation where the headlines levered a substantial disadvantage to companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).

After all, why risk your money in the defense industry when President Trump has seemingly forged peace with North Korea? Even more damning for LMT stock, the POTUS and &quot;Dear Leader&quot; will meet again for further talk. Given the right circumstances, we could have a landmark peace deal on our hands.

Surely, that would hurt the demand picture for LMT stock. But I believe Wall Street is reading this situation incorrectly. Historically, North Korea has broken multiple promises. I'm sorry but appeasement didn't work to sate Adolf Hitler. It's not going to work with Kim Jong-un, either.

Source:  Steve Pomeroy via Flickr (Modified)

### Raytheon (RTN)

Similar to Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) failed to impress anybody last year. Any hope of salvaging something positive from 2018 fell apart during the October market selloff.

That aside, I believe RTN stock has a chance to become one of the best stocks to buy this year. Political insiders believe that due to Trump's domestic troubles, he will eagerly seek a landmark deal with North Korea. If so, that's bad news for Raytheon. Fortunately for shareholders, that's not going to happen.

Consider the optics: the president will cut a deal with a murderer, but not with the American people? Even if the shutdown ended right now, the pain that many Americans already endured -- particularly the U.S. Coast Guard -- makes such negotiations unfathomable.

  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks You Really Need to Look at for 2019 



But if the unthinkable happened, RTN stock has a viable revenue story in Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe worries that his country will be left in the dark during the upcoming talks. With U.S. foreign policy appearing strangely acquiescent lately, Japanese defense forces will eagerly seek the latest military technologies.

### Royal Gold (RGLD)

If you ever considered having some exposure to gold bullion, now seems like an appropriate time. With deep political divisions made worse from the government shutdown, people have rightfully sought stability. Unlike our elected officials, you can always depend on gold to be worth something.

But if you'd rather not deal with the cumbersome nature of precious metals, I'd look into Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD). While the sector is undoubtedly risky, RGLD stock has a few intriguing factors working in its favor.

First, I expect the business to improve with rising gold prices. Because we're still walking on shaky ground with the markets, the idea of precious metals appeals to shrewd investors. Second, many other sector players have witnessed a resurgence in demand.

Finally, RGLD stock benefits from comparatively solid financials. After suffering devastating losses in 2015, management has focused on shoring up its books. In recent years, we've seen improvements in the balance sheet, free cash flow, and sales growth.

Much work remains, but RGLD stock could surprise.

### North American Palladium (PALDF)

As I typically like to do near the end of my galleries, I want to conclude with a speculative name. Mining company North American Palladium (OTCMKTS:PALDF) certainly fits the description. Still, under the right conditions, PALDF stock could surprise market observers.

Like the name suggests, North American Palladium specializes in mining palladium, one of the platinum-group metals. Due to its unique composition, palladium enjoys robust industrial demand. In addition, the metal doesn't have many alternatives. Platinum has similar characteristics but it's also very expensive.

But what makes PALDF one of the best stocks in the high-risk, high-reward segment is rarity. Very few miners in North America focus on palladium. Currently, only two countries feed most of the world's demand for the metal: Russia and South Africa.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



Both countries are politically corrupt, which makes dealing with them difficult. Further, our foreign policy has increasingly butted heads with the Kremlin. This supply-demand dynamic makes an intriguing speculative case for PALDF stock. As an alternative, you can also buy palladium bars or rounds.

As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold, platinum and palladium bullion.

2019-01-24,"It was a rough 2018 for China e-retail giant JD (NASDAQ:JD). As the China economy slowed, JD slowed, too. A strong dollar didn't help things, either. Nor did escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Ultimately, JD went from a 40% revenue grower with expanding margins, to a 20% revenue grower with compressing margins. In the process, JD stock lost more than half of its value.

Calendar 2019 could be an entirely different story.

Signs have emerged over the past three months that the worst may be over for JD stock. Specifically, China's economy may have bottomed, and the U.S. dollar may have maxed out. If so, macroeconomic conditions in China will improve dramatically in 2019.

And, if that happens, JD stock (which trades at anemic valuation levels with majorly depressed sentiment) will soar.

As such, now looks like a good time to buy the dip in JD. Things may not get better right away. But, signs indicate that things will get better in 2019. When they do, this stock could easily see $40 again.

### Positive Economic Developments

We've all seen the headlines by now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) said it had a rough holiday season in China. China's official GDP growth last year was the worst in nearly 30 years. Retail sales growth is at a 15 year low.

But, that's all backward looking data, and it confirms the obvious. China's economy slowed in the back half of 2018, and that slowdown caused once high-flying China internet stocks to fall off a cliff.

More important, signs are starting emerge which imply that 2019 could be the year when China rebounds. Consider the following:

  * U.S. and China trade talks are making progress, and global trade tensions have eased dramatically over the past few weeks. These trade tensions killed China consumer sentiment in late 2018, so easing of such tensions should boost consumer sentiment in 2019.
  * The U.S. Dollar has significantly weakened against the Chinese Yuan in 2019, after strengthening throughout all of 2018. Out-sized U.S. Dollar strength diluted the value of China internet stocks. Reversion to a normal dollar should enhance the value of China internet stocks.
  * The OECD's composite leading indicator for China (CLI) has increased month-over-month for two consecutive months (October and November). Historically speaking over the past ~20 years, back-to-back months of CLI improvement after a multi-month streak of CLI deterioration has always indicated a positive inflection point in China's economy.
  * The OECD's consumer confidence index for China (CCI) has also increased month-over-month for two consecutive months (October and November). Much like the CLI, back-to-back months of improvement in the CCI have historically signaled a turning point in economic trend for China.
  * Multiple companies outside of Apple, including Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG), said they felt no slowdown in the China economy over the past few months.



Overall, there were multiple positive developments in the last two months of 2018 and the first month of 2019 which, in sum, provide substantial evidence that the worst may be over for the China economy, and that 2019 could be a big rebound year.

### Relative Undervaluation Creates Opportunity

If the Chinese economy does rebound in 2019, that will spark a huge rally in JD stock for many reasons. Those reasons are as follows:

  * JD has dropped more than 50% off early 2018 highs due to slowing revenue growth rates amid the rapidly slowing China economy. Improvement in the China economic environment will recharge revenue growth rates, and help push JD way higher.
  * Margins have been hurt as the company has lost sales leverage. If revenue growth re-accelerates due to economic improvements, sales leverage will return, and margins will start heading higher again. This should push EPS estimates higher, and spur multiple expansion, a double tailwind which will send the stock flying higher.
  * JD currently trades at under 0.5X trailing sales, its lowest multiple ever as a public company. Thus, the aforementioned multiple expansion could be quite large, and we could reasonably see that multiple double under normal circumstances, implying $40 prices for JD stock in 2019.
  * Sentiment headwinds related to rape allegations against JD's CEO are now in the rear-view mirror.



Overall, if early 2019 signs are correct and China's economy rebounds this year, then JD is optimally positioned for a rip-your-face-off rally as improving fundamentals converge on a depressed valuation and depressed sentiment.

### Bottom Line on JD Stock

Calendar 2018 was a year to forget for JD stock. Leading economic signs suggest that calendar 2019 could be a year to remember. As such, now looks like a good time buy the dip in JD.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long JD, AAPL, and NKE.

2019-01-24,"Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is a behemoth tech company and after the fourth-quarter selloff, investors are wondering if now is the time to buy Google stock. Let's explore a few reasons why it may be time to pull the trigger.

### Balance Sheet

Let's start with its balance sheet, quietly one of Alphabet's top assets. While some companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have opted to buyback loads of its own stock, Alphabet has let its cash hoard grow and grow. As of last quarter, it has about $106 billion in cash and short-term investments and just under $4 billion in long-term debt.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



In other words, Alphabet is sitting on a $100 billion pile of cash. This gives the company staying power in a recession, as well as flexibility to invest in itself or via M&A.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Google Stock Has Assets

Let's not forget the company's assets either. Alphabet owns the world's most popular website, Google.com, as well as the second most-popular website in YouTube.com. Owning those two properties in the internet world is like owning Park Place and Boardwalk in Monopoly.

However, its investments have paid off too. For instance, its self-driving car unit Waymo was valued as high as $175 billion. It owns Android, the most popular smartphone operating system in the world. Its collection of Google assets, Google Drive (think Docs), Gmail, Maps, Chrome, etc., have more than a billion users each.

### Growth, Valuation and Google Stock

This next part is a two-part catalyst: Growth and valuation.

For 2018, analysts are calling for sales growth of 23% to $136.5 billion. That goes along with 29.6% earnings growth, with estimates calling for earnings per share of $41.80. In 2019, analysts expect 19% revenue growth to $162.8 billion and earnings growth of 13%.

These are solid numbers from a company this big, with Alphabet toting a market cap of $750 billion.

That said, some investors may balk at its valuation of 25 times earnings. But why? Investors continuously buy shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and others with P/E ratios near or north of 20 because they're &quot;safe&quot; plays. That's despite sluggish growth and pressured margins too.

I don't have a problem paying 25 times earnings for GOOGL, a blue-chip technology company with the internet's best assets, strong growth and a rock-solid balance sheet.

### Trading GOOGL Stock

  
Click to Enlarge

There are a lot of common-sense reasons to like Google stock, but what do the charts say? Fortunately, investors can still get Alphabet stock at a good price today.

As we have laid out at least a dozen times here on InvestorPlace, GOOGL stock remains a strong buy at the $1,000 level. Since hitting this mark in December, we're only $85 per share off that level. If investors are debating a long-term position in Alphabet, I wouldn't hesitate to initiate a position on a slight pullback here. That's even with earnings coming up in early February.

Shares are riding short-term uptrend support higher (black line) and are back above the 50-day moving average. Remember, GOOGL stock has a 52-week high near $1,300.

The way the stock is bouncing between $1,200 and $1,000 does make me a little hesitant (green and red circles). That said, this is a long-term winner and I do not bet against GOOGL over the long-term.

2019-01-24,"U.S. stock futures are largely unchanged this morning following a quiet overnight trading session. News remains light this morning with the ongoing government shutdown continuing to dominate the discussion.

Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.1% and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.01%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.31%.

In the options pits, call and put activity were balanced as overall volume remained near average levels. Specifically, about 15.3 million calls and 16 million puts changed hands on the session.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Over at the CBOE, little changed versus Tuesday's trading session. The single-session equity put/call volume ratio closed at 0.64 for the second day in a row. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average held firm at 0.63.

Here were three stocks atop the most-actives list. Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) shares jumped following better-than-expected earnings. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) calls were hot after the stock broke above its 50-day moving average. Finally, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) options were active ahead its report after the closing bell.

Let's take a closer look:

### Proctor & Gamble (PG)

Proctor & Gamble reacted to its quarterly earnings report with a solid 4.9% gain yesterday. The consumer staples giant tested its previous peak and all-time high intraday before paring gains into the close. PG earned $1.25 per share compared to analyst estimates of $1.22.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



The price action of PG has been admirable during the broader market's recent rout. And the strength has come despite the entire consumer staples sector getting dragged lower with everything else. While its industry and the S&P 500 remain well off their respective highs, PG is now a stone's throw from record territory.

On the options trading front, calls won the day. Total activity swelled to 489% of the average daily volume, with 90,445 total contracts traded. Calls contributed 68% to the day's tally.

With the uncertainty of earnings now past, implied volatility sunk like a stone to 19%, which places it at the 28th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of $1.12, or 1.2%.

### Cisco (CSCO)

Though all was quiet on the news front, Cisco stock's pop above the 50-day moving average on Wednesday lit a fire in the options market. For most of 2018, CSCO was rangebound, giving little inspiration to trend traders. Thus far this year the chop continues, but yesterday's clearing of the 50-day does set the table for a potential run back to the upper end of the range near $49.

On the options trading front, calls were all the rage. Total activity rocketed to 263% of the average daily volume, with 104,636 total contracts traded. 85% of the trading came from call options.

Implied volatility ticked higher to 31%, placing it at the 55th percentile of the one-year range. Premiums are now pricing in daily moves of 90, cents or 2%.

### Intel (INTC)

Intel is slated to release earnings after the close on Thursday and options activity is surging in anticipation. Shareholders are hoping the quarterly report will be the catalyst to finally push INTC stock out of the box it's been stuck in for six months. A break above the 200-day moving average and the heavy horizontal resistance zone at $50 would kickstart a new uptrend.

On the options trading front, calls dominated the session despite the down day. Total activity grew to 180% of the average daily volume, with 137,564 total contracts traded. Calls added 77% to the day's take.

The options market provides a glimpse into market expectations for how much Intel should shift after earnings. Right now, option premiums are baking in a $2.02, or 4.2%, move. Regardless of how things shake out tomorrow, I see little reason to get bullish or bearish on INTC until it takes out $50 or $43.

2019-01-25,"If you're under 40, you're building capital and you're looking for gains. This means you should be under-weighting consumer stocks. Names you know that will not grow may throw off income, but they won't make your retirement.

Such stocks should be sold, maybe to your dad, who can use the income and won't mind the lack of gains.

This advice runs contrary to conventional wisdom that tells you to own all the market, to buy index funds and take the bad with the good, because you don't have time to keep up.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Such advice made sense when trading cost big money, and when index funds were a small part of the market. But when you can get into a stock for $5, or out of it, and when index funds send good stocks down along with the bad, or vice versa, it's time to think differently.

This is the problem with conventional wisdom. If everyone is doing the same thing, no matter how wise that thing may appear, it stops working. If everyone buys value, value becomes overvalued.

### Campbell's Soup  (CPB)

As trade opened Jan. 25, shares in Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) were selling for less than they were five years ago.

Some will tell you to buy Campbell because it tossed long-time CEO Denise Morrison last year and the company might be sold. But waiting on a rumor isn't a plan. Even a 30% premium in a takeover won't get this stock back to where it was in 2017.

At $35.38, Campbell's 35-cent-per-share dividend yields almost 4%, but it takes earnings to sustain a dividend, and the company has been able to out-earn its payout in only two of the last four quarters. There is no cash to speak of and $8 billion of debt.

Right now Campbell is selling its international business and it just hired a new CEO, Mark Clouse, who worked at both bidders. He also led Pinnacle Foods into its acquisition by ConAgra Brands (NYSE:CAG) last year.

Maybe Clouse can stabilize the ship. Maybe Clouse can even get the company sold. But while you have your capital tied up wishing and hoping, better companies will be growing.

### Colgate-Palmolive (CL)

If you are to invest in a consumer stock, buy the best of breed.

Shares in Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) are trading at about where they were in January of 2014 because the company isn't best of breed -- it's one of the consumer staples stocks to sell, if anything. Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is best of breed in this area, and when times are troubled, as they are now, the best companies will outperform the second best.

Colgate needs about $400 million in earnings to sustain its dividend, and it only gets 50% more than that, not enough to raise it, and long-term debt is nearly half its assets, with very little cash on the books, meaning there's no room to maneuver out of its problems through an acquisition.

CL is a consumer stock for people in their 70s who see a yield of 2.69% as a bargain. There are people pounding the table for Colgate to be bought, but a young investor should be chasing performance, not rumors, or any of the other consumer stocks on this list.

There are analysts who will tell you that stocks like Colgate do well in bear markets. But, again, the market has no prizes for second place. Colgate shares are down 19% in the last year.

### Hormel Foods (HRL)

Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) is better known as the &quot;House of Spam.&quot;

People laugh at Spam but it's good food, pork and ham made shelf-stable with salt. It helped win World War II. It's still a staple in Hawaii and Alaska.

But the stock trades below where it was a year ago, and the yield is under 2%. The dividend is well-protected by earnings, but there is no growth here. Sales for fiscal 2018, which ended in October, were little changed from 2016. The net change in cash has averaged just $30 million over the last four years.

Hormel was rumored to be buying a mustard company in 2017 but nothing came of it. When Hormel makes news, it's about Spam festivals or good works, not fast profits and not fast change.

If your money is heading into retirement, consider Hormel. They will pay you to own them. They are good people. But if you're looking to grow your nest egg, HRL is one of the stocks to sell and/or avoid.

### Kraft Heinz (KHC)

When the geniuses at 3G Capital combined with legendary investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) to create Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) in 2015, there was excitement and much rejoicing.

But you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, even with zero-based budgeting. Consumer staples like processed cheese and ketchup, those dreaded &quot;middle of the supermarket&quot; items, just aren't growing. Kraft Heinz has been unable to grow sales for the last three years, and so the stock is down about 50% from its 2017 high.

The fall in price has made the dividend more valuable. The yield is now 5.3%, so this might be a good pick-up for an income investor. But cheap stocks are cheap for a reason. The price-to-earnings multiple of Kraft Heinz is under 6x.

Packaged goods companies like Kraft Heinz just aren't the safe havens they once were. Their share of the western dinner plate is slowly shrinking. Younger consumers want fresh food and older consumers can afford fresh food.

Kraft Heinz needs nearly $3 billion in income, each year, to pay its $2.50 per share dividend. Thanks to 3G management, it gets that, and more. But there is over $28 billion in long-term debt on the books, against less than $1.5 billion in cash. Kraft's acquisitions are small, marginal and distracting. Kraft growth initiatives like Devour, frozen meals targeted at men, are growing but not fast enough to change the narrative.

### YUM Brands (YUM)

Unlike the other companies in this collection YUM! Brands (NYSE:YUM) has delivered investors a capital gain over the last year, but it's under 10%.

In order to deliver that gain, YUM! Management has been doing all it can to create buzz. It gets women to dress up as Colonel Sanders, it constantly tinkers with the Taco Bell menu and it delivers beer for Pizza Hut. 

But fast food is fast food. Fast food is not a growth industry. Spinning out the Chinese operations as YUM China (NASDAQ:YUMC) in 2016 was a winner for shareholders, but when you buy stock, you're buying tomorrow.

YUM! continues to push for growth, but there is very little growth in fast food, and the yield on the stock's 36-cent-per-share dividend is just 1.6%. YUM management continues to try and control its store ecosystem, recently buying QuikOrder, which sells sales software to fast food restaurants.

2019-01-25,"Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a growth machine and investments in Amazon stock keep seeming to pay off. Much of that growth comes from some pretty high-tech endeavors.

From getting out of the home and into your car, providing a ton of web services and hosting as well as tackling the world of digital advertising, Amazon has plenty of avenues to keep the revenues coming far into the future. However, one of biggest future revenue drivers at Amazon could be very low-tech.

We're talking about private-label and store-branded products.

  * 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



Amazon is taking a page out of old school retail and is quickly filling its online catalog full of wholly-owned branded products as another way to keep boosting sales. And in this case, it boosts margins as well.

For investors, it's another reason to own Amazon stock.

### Amazon Stock and Generic Goods

There's a good chance that in your cupboard, refrigerator or medicine cabinet, you have some sort of store-branded product: aspirin from Walgreen's (NYSE:WBA), maybe sandwich bags from Target (NYSE:TGT) or even Kroger (NYSE:KR) branded soda.

The point is that generic and store branded items have been around for a long time. Often, they come with lower price points, so consumers loved them. Retailers love them as well as they generally come with much higher margins per unit than the branded equivalent.

Over the years, retailers have gotten a bit sneaky with their store brands. Target, for example, owns a host of brands that don't include its trademark bullseye on the label. This provides consumers with the illusion that they are getting a more premium product, while still getting some value.

Now Amazon wants in on the action.

Amazon has quickly and quietly amazed a huge catalog of wholly-owned private brands, 125 of them to be exact. Those private brands now encompass more than 6,825 different products.

Some are easy to spot, such as its Amazon Basics or Amazon Essentials. Others are much harder to see. Quickly searching for home furnishings on Amazon will return items by Rivet or Stone & Beam. How about Presto in dish soap or paper towels?

Amazon has plenty of reasons to do this of course.

For one thing, margins remain very fat on store branded items and Amazon gets to keep that margin all to its self. Secondly, thanks to its huge logistics network, Amazon is quickly moving towards being the leader in end-to-end retail. That is, moving from design and manufacturing to sale to ultimately delivery.

Moreover, controlling all the steps along the way, allows AMZN to pull in more than just having Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) produce an item.

### Private Label and Amazon Stock

The juicy thing is that all of this isn't just Amazon selling generic ibuprofen, it's the way they are doing it.

We've already discussed how Amazon is starting to win at digital advertising. For example, search for the word &quot;detergent&quot; and Tide is the first pick. PG paid Amazon a hefty fee in order for that to happen. However, the second selection is often an Amazon house brand. Just like how Kroger may place its butter right next to Land O' Lakes packages.

That spot is a good place to be, and it gathers a lot of eyeballs. So much so, that according to research by Cowen & Co., Amazon is able to quickly gain 25 to 40% market share on an item within six months of launch.

That's 100% due to the fact that Amazon is able to push its own products. The crazier thing is that now, firms like PG and those in lower search results are willing to pay Amazon more in ad fees to move up the list and get out in front.

And it still gets juicer for Amazon.

The company knows more about people shopping habits than anyone. The data they have on you is insane. Because of this, the firm is able to quickly move into private label products that have a very good chance of selling well.

When it does, it's very easy for them to reel you in with ads, software-generated product suggestions and a gentle nudge from Alexa. &quot;I know you usually buy Dawn, but what about trying Mountain Falls this order?&quot;

The best part is that all of this is working. Analysts at SunTrust suggest that Amazon will generate around $7.5 billion in revenues from private label brands throughout 2018. Because of its continued moves, that number is set to explode higher and reach $25 billion by the time 2022 rolls in.

### The Bottom Line on Amazon Stock

All in all, Amazon is taking a page out of old school retail playbook with using generic and private label brands. The difference is in the execution. With its product placement and ability to grow sales on its pages, the firm really has a huge potential revenue driver in its hands.

Even more so, when you consider that competing firms may have to pay Amazon fees to boost their sales on the site. It's just another way, Amazon stock is a must own for the long haul.

Disclosure: As of the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held no position in any stock mentioned.

Then, the plunge started, triggered by the heating up of the trade war, the cooling of global growth, the stumbling of China's economy, and less accomodative monetary policies.

BIDU stock ended 2018 at $160, down more than 30% for the year.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term 



As forgettable as 2018 was for Baidu stock, 2019 could be quite memorable. BIDU is a deeply undervalued stock supported by the continuous growth drivers of the still-expanding Chinese digital economy.

Those drivers slowed in 2018, pulling Baidu's revenue growth and margins lower. But if signs emerge in 2019 that economic activity is reaccelerating in China, then the company's drivers will be reinvigorated, pushing up its revenue growth and margins and sparking a huge rally by BIDU.

Fortunately, it appears that this will be the case. Multiple data points suggest that the worst is over for China's economy, and that it's in the midst of a big turning point.

This turnaround will spark a big rally by Baidu stock. When that rally gets going, it will last a long time, as both fundamentals and analysts' price targets indicate that the price of Baidu stock should rise well above $200.

Overall, it finally seems like a good time to buy BIDU stock on weakness.

### China Looks Poised to Rebound

Although China's headline data remains weak, as the country's GDP growth reached its lowest level in nearly 30 years and its retail sales growth hit a 15-year low, there's reason to believe that China's economy has bottomed and is in the process of turning around.

All the negative data about China is backward-looking. GDP growth is a snapshot of economic activity over the past several months and quarters. Retail sales growth is a snapshot of consumer strength over the past month.

If you focus on forward-looking data instead, the outlook starts to change. Signs are emerging that China's economy is in the process of reversing course. Consider the following four points:

  * Trade talks between the U.S. and China are making progress.
  * The U.S. dollar has significantly weakened against the Chinese yuan in 2019, after the dollar strengthened against China's currency throughout all of 2018.
  * The OECD's composite leading indicator for China (CLI), , which &quot;is designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles,&quot; has increased month-over-month for two consecutive months (October and November). History shows that consecutive months of positive CLI growth after a multi-month streak of negative CLI growth is always indicative of China's economy turning a corner.
  * The OECD's consumer confidence index for China has also increased month-over-month for two consecutive months (October and November).



Overall, leading indicators suggest that China's economy is currently in the process of rebounding. If the country's economy bounces back in 2019, and if the U.S. dollar continues to weaken against the Chinese yuan, then Baidu stock could be well-positioned for a huge rally.

### Analysts See Huge Upside for BIDU

Across the board, analysts love BIDU stock and think it is worth far more than its current price tag.

According to third-party website TipRanks, the average price target on Baidu stock among 16 Wall Street analysts is $240, implying nearly 50% upside from current levels. The lowest price target among the analysts profiled by the site is $185, and that's still 14% above the current level of BIDU stock.

Meanwhile, the algorithms over at Finbox.io put Baidu stock's fair value at over $290. The folks at Morningstar agree, as they believe that the fair value of Baidu stock is over $320.

Overall, nearly everyone who covers BIDU thinks the stock is worth more than $200. Thus, once the rally gets going, Baidu stock should reach $200 and will probably exceed that level.

### Fundamentals Support Upside

BIDU's fundamentals also indicate that Baidu stock should trade above $200.

BIDU reported revenues of $12 billion last year. Its U.S. counterpart, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), had a top line of $130 billion and is still growing at a 20%-plus pace. So it appears that Baidu's revenue can still increase much more. That growth will come from increased demand for digital ads in China, more widespread adoption of the Internet of Things in the country, and bigger investments by Chinese businesses in the cloud and artificial intelligence.

As a result, Baidu's revenue can easily grow at an annual rate of 20%-plus over the next several years.

Margins have been a headache for this company. But if China's economy turns around and Baidu's growth accelerates, the company's margins will start to trend higher, too.

Thus, Baidu's margins will increase, while its revenue will rise at a 20%-plus annual rate. Assuming 20% revenue growth and an operating margin of  25%, Baidu's EPS could reasonably hit $16 by 2022. Based on a forward price-earnings multiple of 20, which is average for growth companies, and a 10% discount rate, that equates to a 2019 price target of over $260.

### The Bottom Line on Baidu Stock

BIDU stock has been undervalued for a long time due to the persistent weakness of much of the Chinese economy. But signs are finally starting to emerge that the Chinese economy is in the process of reversing course. If China's economy rebounds in 2019, that catalyst that will send Baidu stock flying to levels above $200.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BIDU, NKE, and GOOG.

However, investors are believers again despite the so-so outlook for the quarter currently underway.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

There's a curious detail in last quarter's accounting statements, however, that's gone largely unnoticed in the midst of the renewed debates over the importance of the iPhone. That is, Apple once again added to its war chest of cash, and has amassed a (fairly) liquid fortune every other organization can only dream of.

There's one way the company should seriously consider spending its cash on hand …

### Apple's Cash on Hand

Just how much cash does Apple have on hand? Per the company's quarterly filing, CEO Tim Cook and his team now have a whopping $44.7 billion in the bank and another $41.6 billion worth of marketable securities that could be quickly turned into cash.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



That's not the whole picture, though. Excluded from those figures is the money Apple has earned overseas and kept there. Despite a much friendlier repatriation tax rate on those funds now, the consumer-tech giant is still sitting on a huge stash of overseas funds.

All told, the Apple cash on hand figure now stands at a stunning $245 billion, with (reportedly) plans to bring much of it back into the U.S. over the course of the next few years.

It's a ridiculous amount of money. Most companies -- not even the ones in the S&P 500 -- sport market capitalizations of that magnitude. In total, only 16 organizations surpass that figure in terms of capitalization. If repatriation taxes and other ancillary costs weren't an issue, Apple could afford to outright acquire giants like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), or any of the other thousands of organizations with lesser valuations.

The world is Apple's oyster, so to speak. It can buy almost anything, or any entity, it wants.

So how exactly should those Apple cash reserves be deployed? The answer lies in where the bulk of last year's deal-making was done … at the intersection of technology and entertainment.

### Where Apple Should Spend Its Cash

It's a difficult question to answer simply because such fortuitous circumstances are rarely seen. But, given the iPhone slowdown, the advent of services as a standalone profit center -- and the ongoing blurring of the lines that have historically differentiated technology, the media and the entertainment industries -- a handful of ideas come to mind …

Chief among them is the acquisition of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), which is en route to integrating with Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA).

It's an idea that's been circulating for years, but it has been largely dismissed. The two companies have done well driving in their own proverbial lanes, and melding them had the potential to do more damage than harm.

The idea certainly makes more sense now than it has in the past. AT&T (NYSE:T) now owns Time Warner, and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a serious video entertainment venue, via Prime. Apple, in fact, has turned up the heat on its home-grown entertainment business, reportedly spending more than $1 billion over the course of the past few months to bring all-new content to consumers sometime this year.

Apple is still behind the video and film eight ball, though, and it may struggle to catch up with competitors on its own. Dealmaking will be the only way it can catch up. Such a deal would most definitely push Apple Inc. toward its goal of becoming a services-oriented outfit. Buying Disney would be more than enough of a draw to pull consumers into the Apple ecosystem.

Or if not Disney, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) …

The on-demand streaming giant is still bleeding money, but Apple could easily absorb it after scooping up Netflix for even a hefty premium above its current market cap of $145 billion. Better still, Netflix's existing user base of 148 million are already accustomed to paying subscription fees. Selling them another digital product or service wouldn't be a huge hurdle to clear.

A video play is also the lowest-risk path of all the acquisitions that have been suggested.

2019-02-19,"For some 20 years now, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has been one of the most frustrating stocks in the market. Plug Power stock never has been able to drive sustained, consistent upside for its shareholders. Yet PLUG stock repeatedly has teased those investors with big news.In 2017, it was a supposedly transformative deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). In late 2013, it was a huge burst in orders after an investment by Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) that moved PLUG stock from close to zero to over $5 in a matter of months. Back in 2009, Plug Power stock touched $12 (on a split-adjusted basis). Back at the height of the dot-com bubble, it cleared $1,000.All along, Plug Power's management has promised that the company is close to finally generating positive EBITDAS. (EBITDAS is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation.) Each time, Plug Power seems to fall short. Simply put, PLUG is a stock that's supposedly been just a year or two away for two decades.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth And yet there are reasons why investors keep investing in Plug Power stock. The company has an impressive customer list. The hydrogen fuel-cell technology that powers its forklifts is proven. Profits have been difficult to come by for PLUG, but its revenue is growing. While PLUG's two-decade history makes it difficult to aggressively pound the table for Plug Power stock, its  story isn't over quite yet. Plug Power Stock Spikes Ahead of a Big YearAs broad markets sold off in December, Plug Power stock unsurprisingly fell sharply. PLUG, in fact, lost about 40% of its value in just the first few weeks of that month. A &quot;risk-off&quot; market wanted no part of a money-losing small-cap name like PLUG.With sentiment towards stocks improving, Plug Power stock has recovered. And the stock last Thursday  bounced 19.3%. The reason for the move remains unclear, but a spike in volume to more than three times the 90-day trailing average suggests a large order might have come through.The bounce comes a couple of weeks before the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, which is likely to be released during the second week of March. Last month, the company provided a business update, estimating that its top line surged 40% in 2018 and will jump roughly 30% this year.Perhaps more notably, Plug Power estimated that its EBITDAS would be positive in 2019. That's a long-held goal of Plug Power. Sustainable profits - even excluding certain items - would allow the company to stop issuing more shares of PLUG stock to fund its operations. And it would perhaps give the market confidence that - finally - Plug Power has found a way to generate sustainable profits. The Risks Facing Plug Power StockThat said, PLUG is facing multiple risks that need to be considered. PLUG may seem &quot;cheap&quot; below $2, but it's anything but cheap. This still is a business that's  valued at around $450 million, including its net debt. That's almost double the company's  2019 revenue guidance for a business whose gross margins are still small.As for profitability, CEO Andy Marsh has been promising break-even EBITDAS - or something close to that - for most of the decade. Investors would be forgiven for being skeptical about the company's 2019 guidance. PLUG truly is a &quot;show me&quot; story at this point.From a broader standpoint, the key question is simple: does PLUG really have a viable business? Its revenues have grown sharply lately. Plug Power has some big customers, including Amazon, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) (which also has warrants on PLUG stock), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). But the market for forklifts simply may not be large enough. And the company's promises to move into adjacent areas, such as hydrogen-powered drones, can't be trusted just yet.In the meantime, developments in energy technology could undercut Plug Power as it tries to become profitable. Analyst Craig Irwin of Roth Capital noted last month that  Walmart could use lithium-ion lift trucks. Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) operates in a different space, but its natural gas-based technology theoretically could be incorporated into forklifts. PLUG May Still Deliver a High RewardIt's not over for PLUG, by any means. And if the company can finally get to where it's promised to go, Plug Power stock can rally.But PLUG still has major issues, and the valuation of Plug Power isn't that cheap,  while its execution has been disappointing. Maybe this time is different, it will have to be for PLUG to rise meaningfully.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-02-19,"Shares of Procter and Gamble (NYSE:PG) made a fresh all-time high recently following earnings. PG stock traded up to nearly the $100 level before finally running into resistance. It made another all-time high today, but the $100 level again stymied it. Could now be the time to take a counter-trend short position on an overbought and overvalued Procter and Gamble?Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)PG reported earnings Jan. 23, beating on both the top and bottom line. EPS came in at $1.25 per share, slightly higher than the $1.21 analyst estimates. Revenue also topped forecasts at $17.44 billion compared to expectations of $17.15 billion.So while earnings beat by 2.4% and sales by 3.3%, PG stock rallied almost 10% in response. This now puts the P/E ratio near the highest level of the past year at nearly 24. The last time Procter and Gamble was valued so richly was mid December, right before a sharp 12% pullback in the stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPG stock is also at the highest price to sales ratio over the past 10 years at nearly 4 times sales. The company expects total sales to be flat for 2019, so certainly sales growth is not the reason for the extreme valuations.PG stock is getting decidedly overbought on a technical basis. Procter and Gamble made a new all time intra-day high of $99.70 on Feb. 13 before reversing course to actually close slightly lower on the day.  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth This type of reversal pattern is a doji candlestick pattern. It indicates exhaustion as the buyers may have finally become fatigued. It is especially symbolic after such a strong rally, like the most recent one in PG. And the stock tried again today, but again seems to be fading.  Click to Enlarge Other technical indicators are also flashing red. The 9-day RSI is finally weakening after breaching the overbought 70 level. Prior instances when PG stock was this overbought proved to mark significant intermediate-term tops in the stock.The 14-day detrended price oscillator also reached an extreme reading before weakening as well.PG is trading at a large premium to the 20-day moving average which almost invariable lead to a pullback in the past. MACD is turning lower after printing at the second highest level of the past year. Implied volatility is now at trough valuations, yet another sign of over complacency.The combination of a historically rich valuations and overbought technicals makes PG stock a good candidate for a short-term short, especially now that the rally has fizzled at the $100 level. I would look to short PG stock near current levels with a downside profit objective of near the earnings gap of $93. Option traders may elect to take advantage of dirt cheap option prices and buy the April $97.50 puts to take a more aggressive short stance.Tim Biggam may hold some of the aforementioned securities in one or more of his newsletters.

2019-03-01,"Stocks have been doing very well in 2019. Some of this is a recovery from the massive selloff in Q4 of last year, and some of it is a rosy picture of the coming year.Underlying much of it is the Federal Reserve's repositioning on interest rates. Its stated policy was to raise at least twice in 2019 to stay ahead of creeping inflation. When that remained the case, companies' earnings were disappointing investors and their projections were equally dour, selling got started in earnest.But when the Fed relented on rate hikes, the market began to breathe easier. And as long as the Fed continues down that path, the market should continue to run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRecent GDP numbers were decent, if not salacious. Yet there remains contradictory data that should keep us all vigilant about expecting this bull to lift all stocks into the future -- consumer spending in December was the worst since 2009.Granted the government shutdown may have had some effect, but most of the December shopping was done by the time it kicked in, so it may have been a worse number because of that, but not by much.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever The seven top-rated stocks to buy for March are delivering A ratings for their quantitative qualities, meaning investors like what they see and are buying these shares enthusiastically. Capital Investment Company (CIC)Source:  lee via FlickrCapital Investment Company (NYSE:CIC) is what is known in the industry as a blank-check company. Basically, it raises private equity capital in tranches and then looks for a company to buy.This the CIC's fourth such deal and it has done well with its first three investments. The first was in 2009, starting Maryland real estate investment trust Two Harbors Investment Corp (NYSE:TWO), which is now the third-largest mortgage REIT in the U.S.The second deal was in 2015, investing in Lindblad Expeditions (NASDAQ:LIND), an adventure travel company. The stock is up 48% in the past year as adventure travel becomes a very popular travel choice among many demographics.The third deal was in 2017, merging with Cision (NYSE:CISN), a media research company.Each of these deals is a separate &quot;company,&quot; so you're essentially investing in CIC's next project. And from the looks of things, investors are coming aboard swiftly. Haymaker Acquisition (HYAC)Source: Shutterstock Haymaker Acquisition (NASDAQ:HYAC) is another blank-check firm that focuses on the consumer sector, including media and hospitality industries as well as traditional retail consumer products and services.A number of these blank-check companies showed up on my Portfolio Grader this time around, which is an interesting development. It seems that institutional investors and hedge funds are looking for market alternatives for diversification, rather than just investing in publicly traded companies or investing in private companies directly.  * 10 Best High-Growth Stocks for Young Investors It seems private equity companies are now starting to be publicly traded themselves. This could be interesting. Big financial institutions may see this as a way to outsource their alternative investing portfolio without having to build or expand current operations. An interesting sector to watch, to be sure. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is the forefather of consumer staples companies. The Ohio-based company has been around since 1837 and has found a way to not just survive, but thrive during the past 182 years.It has seen depressions, world wars … pretty much anything an economy and consumers can throw at a company. Pampers, Tide, Downy, Charmin, Tampax, Old Spice, Pantene, Dawn, Gillette, Vicks, Crest, Olay, Secret and that is just to name a few.It's no surprise that a couple of years ago it went through a significant purge of brands it has accumulated over the years and refocused on its core divisions and brands. And it has paid off.In the past 12 months, this steady-Eddie company was up 23%, not including its rock-solid 2.9% dividend.And even while the markets are booming, the smart money is buying into PG as not only a great hedge, but a great total return foundation pick. Mastercard  (MA)Source: Hakan Dahlstrom via Flickr (Modified)Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is another well-known brand with a deserved reputation for smart growth and solid returns. But the thing is, MA is transforming with its industry.While there is plenty of buzz about financial technology companies (aka, fintechs), MA is one of the original fintechs. And savvy investors are starting to realize it. Money is going digital and MA hasn't been sitting on its hands.For everyone concerned, a cashless world is very convenient. And for banks and companies, digital transactions are significantly cheaper than cash transactions. The downside for some is that cash provides some level of anonymity and privacy -- it isn't logged into a database with a name and account attached to it.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market But with the big money on digital payments, MA, with its global reach and well-respected brand is an easy choice for financial institutions and businesses around the world. Nike (NKE)Source: Shutterstock Nike (NYSE:NKE) is the 800-pound gorilla of the athletic footwear and apparel market. With a market cap of nearly $135 billion, it's nearly 3x larger in market than its major competitor Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY).Even a hot company like Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is a chimp compared to this massive primate. Although LULU has been in the press a lot recently, and I do like the company.Even though NKE has returned a respectable 31% in the past 12 months, it hasn't seen the growth that LULU has seen. Still, it looks like there's a shift of interest back into a major diversified player like NKE.And one of its big retail partners, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) recently announced that it's investing $275 million in Asia, which is already a strong market for NKE, and this will only help the brand. And a stronger consumer at home- and the advent of spring and summer sports -- will also be a boost. Diageo (DEO)Source: Puamella via Flickr (Modified)Diageo (NYSE:DEO) is a sin stock. So, if you're not interested in one of the world's largest and best alcoholic beverage companies, then you can skip this recommendation.But if you're interested in a great company with a return of 352% in the past 17 years (give or take) -- that's about a 20.7% annual average return -- then read on.Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Ketel One, Ciroc, Captain Morgan, Tanqueray are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the brands that sit in the DEO portfolio.Combine that with the fact that younger drinkers are buying less beer and wine and buying more high-end alcohol, they're choosing quality over volume in the U.S. And that is a big deal, since much of the U.S. consumer-focused market has always counted on U.S. consumer to be of the more-is-better mentality.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks the Street Loves Also, with the loosening of cannabis laws, infused products in North America are going to be big … and hip. DEO will certainly be a major player in this burgeoning sector. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: StarbucksStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) started as a single store that operated in the famous Pike Place Fish Market in Seattle. It remained a single store for a decade until Howard Schultz joined the team.After a trip to Italy, Schultz realized the potential for cafes in the U.S., done in a truly American style. In 1987 he and a group of investors bought the original Starbucks and turned it into what we see today -- 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries.Essentially, SBUX has turned a classic European business into a quintessentially American product and brand. The past decade has seen a lot of the company's growth. And the amazing thing is, given its vast network, it still finds ways to grow its bottom -- and top -- line.And if we've learned anything about corporate chiefs that run for high public office, it's that it does wonders for their brand. Now that former CEO Schultz is looking into a presidential bid, you can be sure that for now it's free advertising every time he speaks or is featured on a new segment.Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

Though they're not always high-flying, sizzling growth names, they've usually got enough history and enough stability to qualify them as names you can buy and forget about for a few years.Not all of the market's most recognized, long-lived names are always great investments, however. Sometimes, even the most compelling large company sees its stock race to wild valuations. Other times, even an iconic outfit can slip into trouble that's unbecoming of a blue chip. It's rare that such stumbles turn into company-killers, to be fair, though it's not unheard of either.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the market's most troubled blue-chip stocks that are not only not buy-worthy, but large companies that could end up doing damage to investors that insist on owning them.  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound In other words, though they're blue chips, they're still stocks to sell rather than buy … particularly when there are so many other high-quality stocks to step into. General Electric (GE)There's no reason not to kick off this list of blue-chip stocks to sell with a look at the market's most recent high-profile fall from grace. General Electric (NYSE:GE), once an icon of American industrialism, has become un-ownable.That's at least according to JPMorgan Chase analyst Stephen Tusa, who late last year lowered his price target on GE stock to $6 -- versus its current price near $8 -- explaining &quot;While the stock is down ~70% from the peak of $30, this move still does not sufficiently reflect the fundamental facts, in our view.&quot;Though the company can be salvaged, it has been piling up more and more surprising problems of late, leaving investors terrified of &quot;what's next?&quot; Illinois Tool Works (ITW)There's a reason why  the number of major hedge funds that owned Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) stock had been pared down from 38 to 28 over the four quarters that preceded N0v. 2018.Exactly what that reason is, or reasons are, isn't perfectly clear. Ultimately though, it has probably got something to do with the company's tepid sales growth despite a roaring economy, as well as a relatively frothy valuation.  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound Analysts are only looking for sales growth of less than 1% in 2019. Earnings are growing a bit faster, but all in all it's just not enough. Procter & Gamble (PG)Credit has to be given where it's due. Relatively new Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) CEO David Taylor has pointed the company back in the right direction. The company's fiscal Q1 sales growth was the best growth the company had logged in years, and its sales excluding acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations increased 4% last quarter.PG stock has responded well to the turnaround as well, up 25% over the last year.It's an impressive run, but may also be about as good as it gets for a while. The current price of $99 may not be sustainable, as P&G's trailing P/E ratio of 24.1 is near the highest level it's been in years. Facebook (FB)Don't misread the message. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is still the king of social networking, and it's not going anywhere.On the other hand, the Facebook we're likely to see at the end of this year isn't nearly as impressive as the one we knew and loved at the end of 2017. FB warned the market in Q2 of 2018 that its growth pace would weaken at &quot;high single-digit percentages&quot; going forward, and its Q3 report essentially validated that concern. Moreover,FB stock, despite its rally so far this year,  is still down nearly  20% from its July high. Activision Blizzard (ATVI)Down about 50% since their early October peak, shares of video game publisher Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) look tantalizing. This is, after all, one of the most prolific and storied names in the business.The prompt for the pullback, however, may be much bigger in scope than most investors realize. Part of the selloff was spurred by a tepid Q4 outlook, and an earlier part was prompted by lackluster sales of its newest entry into the Call of Duty franchise (Call of Duty: Black Ops 4).  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound In a bigger-picture sense though, both may be mere clues that the company has lost its touch when it comes to developing new titles. Gilead Sciences (GILD)Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is still one of the biggest names in HIV and hepatitis treatments. But, in some ways it's become a victim of its own success. After demonstrating the kinds of cash cows those diseases could become, competitors were inspired to enter the fray. Hepatitis C drug Mavyret, from AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), and HIV treatment Tivicay/Triumeq from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), for example, both ate into Gilead's market share in 2018.In September, the company announced it would begin selling not cheaper versions of other companies' drugs, but cheaper generic versions of its own hep-C drugs. It could take a while for investors to adjust to the new paradigm, which is considerably less thrilling than the old one was. Oracle (ORCL)Some credit has to be given. Considering how late Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) was to the cloud-computing party, it has made some respectable inroads to the business. It had to. The cloud is the future. It has a tenuous, tentative hold on its small sliver of the cloud computing market, and not everyone believes the company will be able to hold on in a meaningful way.Futurum Research's Daniel Newman is one of those doubters.

Sales and earnings are projected to grow this year and in 2020.It's not red hot growth, to be clear. Revenue growth isn't expected to exceed 5.5% in 2019 or 2020. Nevertheless, it sure beats the backpedaling many of these companies are facing.Still, this is a company facing a time limit and a headwind that will never stop blowing. If healthier mindsets don't turn into an insurmountable problem, tougher regulations will. Lowe's Companies (LOW)Last but not least, add Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) to your list of blue-chip stocks to sell sooner rather than later.There's nothing inherently disastrous about the company. The company's sales are forecast to grow this year and next year.The next few quarters, if not years, could prove relatively disappointing though. Sales of existing homes are slowing down. And the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) has indicated that consumers are dialing back how much they plan to spend on remodeling through the end of 2019.  * 7 Chinese Stocks to Buy for the 2019 Rebound Chris Herbert, Managing Director of Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, explains &quot;Rising mortgage interest rates and flat home sales activity around much of the country are expected to pinch otherwise very strong growth in homeowner remodeling spending moving forward. Low for-sale inventories are presenting a headwind because home sales tend to spur investments in remodeling and repair both before a sale and in the years following.&quot;As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-08,"Even elite businesses with juicy dividends suffer share price selloffs from time to time.Sometimes, these selloffs are caused by short-term, solvable problems within the individual companies.Sometimes, these selloffs are caused because the overall stock market goes down in value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese selloffs are almost always opportunities to buy these firms at bargain prices and start collecting steady dividend payments.When you spend money on any big purchase, like a home or a car, you want to pay a good price. You want to get value for your dollar.When you buy a car, you want to pay a good price. When you buy a house, you want to pay a good price. You don't want to overpay. You don't want to embarrass yourself by getting ripped off.Yet… when people invest, the idea of paying a good price is often cast aside.They get excited about a story they read in a magazine… or how much their brother-in-law is making in a stock, and they just buy it.They don't pay any attention to the price they're paying… or the value they're getting for their investment dollar.Warren Buffett often repeats a valuable quote from investment legend Ben Graham: &quot;Price is what you pay, value is what you get.&quot;I think that's a great way to put it.Like many investment concepts, it's helpful to think of it in terms of real estate:Let's say there's a great house in your neighborhood. It's an attractive house with solid, modern construction and new appliances. It could bring in $30,000 per year in rent. This is the &quot;gross&quot; rental income… or the income you have before subtracting expenses.If you could buy this house for just $120,000, it would be a good deal.Since $30,000 goes into $120,000 four times, you could get back your purchase price in gross rental income in just four years.In this example, we'd say you're paying &quot;four times gross rental income.&quot;Now… let's say you pay $600,000 for that house.Since $30,000 goes into $600,000 20 times, you would get back your purchase price in gross rental income in 20 years.In this example, we'd say you're paying &quot;20 times gross rental income.&quot;Paying $600,000 is obviously not as good a deal as paying just $120,000.Remember, in this example, we're talking about buying the same house.We're talking about the same amount of rental income.In one case, you're paying a good price. You're getting a good deal. You'll recoup your investment in gross rental income in just four years.In the other case, you're paying a lot more. You're not getting a good deal. It will take you 20 years just to recoup your investment.And it's all a factor of the price you pay.It works the same way when investing in a business…You want to buy at a good price that allows you to get a good return on your investment. You want to avoid buying at a bloated, expensive price.This is a vital point.No matter, how great a business is, it can turn out to be a terrible investment if you pay the wrong price.If you're not clear on this point, please read through the home example again.When it comes to buying elite businesses that raise their dividends every year, you can use the company's dividend yield to help you answer the important question:  &quot;Is this business trading for a good price or a bad price?&quot;Here's how it works…When a stock's price goes down and the annual dividend remains the same, the dividend yield rises.For example, let's say a stock is $50 per share and pays a $2 per share annual dividend. This represents a yield of 4% (since 2 is 4% of 50).If the stock declines to $40 per share and the dividend payment remains $2 per share, the stock will yield 5% (since 2 is 5% of 40).When a selloff causes an elite dividend-payer to trade near the high end of its historical dividend yield range, it's a bargain… and it's a good idea to buy shares.Remember, these companies pay the world's most reliable dividends.Their annual payouts only go one way -- UP.When an elite dividend-payer's share price suffers a decline of more than 15%, consider it &quot;on sale&quot; and buy it.For example, in the late 2008/early 2009 stock market decline, shares of elite dividend payer Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) fell from $65 to $45 (a decline of 30%).Procter & Gamble is one of the world's top consumer product businesses. Every year, it sells billions and billions of dollars' worth of basic, everyday products like Gillette razors, Pampers diapers, Charmin toilet paper, Crest toothpaste, Bounty paper towels, and Tide laundry detergent. It has raised its dividend every year for more than 60 years.Investors who stepped in to buy this high-quality business after the market decline could have purchased shares at $50.In the five years that followed, Procter & Gamble climbed to $80 per share. Its annual dividend grew to $2.57 per share.This annual dividend represented a 5.1% yield on a purchase price of $50 per share… and that yield will continue rising for many years.Owning one of the world's best businesses… earning a 5.1% yield on your shares… collecting a safe income stream that rises every year…Buying the best at bargain prices is a beautiful thing.If you have the interest, time and knowhow, you can track these businesses yourself. You can find all the information you need on many free financial websites.Or, you can simply pay an advisor or research firm to do it for you. I'd be remiss not to invite you to check out Neil George's Profitable Investing. Neil can recommend plenty of elite dividend-payers, complete with buy-below prices.Remember, you can make a bad investment in a great business if you pay a stupid price. View your investment purchases just like you would the purchase of a home, a car, or a computer.Get good value for your investment dollar. And when an elite dividend-payer sells off for some reason, see it as an opportunity to buy quality at a bargain price.Once you've got price on your side, you've got to put time on your side. Here's how.Regards,BrianCompare Brokers The post A Strategy for Buying Elite Businesses at Bargain Prices appeared first on InvestorPlace.",A Strategy for Buying Elite Businesses at Bargain Prices

2019-03-18,"Despite its long history, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) may have only just begun. Cisco stock once flew so high that it briefly attained the largest market cap. After the end of the dot-com boom, CSCO languished for years.Source: Shutterstock However, CSCO stock has taken on a new identity as a dividend-paying stock focused more on software and security. As a result, it appears positioned to benefit from the growth of 5G wireless technology.Between the dividend and the emergence of 5G, CSCO appears set to become one of the essential growth and income stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Stocks That May Be Hurt by This Year's Big IPOs  Cisco: The Income StockI once had quite a history with Cisco stock. I bought shares in 1997, and I was thrilled when they had risen eightfold in just over two years thanks to the dot-com boom. Depressingly, I then watched most of my gains melt away over the next year and a half before I finally sold for a more modest profit.Much like I have become a different investor, Cisco has become a different company. The old Cisco focused on hardware. Today, the emphasis has shifted to software and security. Moreover, the Cisco of old focused on investments, buying companies, and inspiring a higher stock price. Today's Cisco trades 36% below its record high of 19 years ago and emphasizes its rising dividend.As for the payout, the company will pay out $1.40 to shareholders this year. This places the current yield at almost 2.7%. Moreover, CSCO has hiked the payout every year since the stock began paying dividends in 2011. Those who have held since 2011 earn a double-digit percentage yield. It would surprise me if CSCO stock did not become attain dividend aristocrat status (meaning 25-plus years of dividend hikes) in 17 years. Poised for More GrowthThis does not mean I advocate writing off Cisco stock as a stodgy Dow 30 equity. CSCO will produce necessary products and generate dividends. That said, I do not think Cisco will become more like Dow peers Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) than growth stocks such as Square (NYSE:SQ) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).However, I expect Cisco's products to generate more investor enthusiasm, and with that, more growth to add to the income stream. Wall Street forecasts profit increases of 18.1% this year and 10.1% the next. Moreover, CSCO has attained something unimaginable with the old Cisco stock--a low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. Today, CSCO stock maintains a forward multiple of about 15.4.That appears cheap when considering the role Cisco will play in the 5G space. CSCO has created a &quot;Cloud-to-Client&quot; solution for 5G. This will affect the network at every level. It offers a seamless 5G solution end-to-end that will enhance security while optimizing speed and performance. This should drive profit increases as Cisco stock moves into the next decade--and the next quantum leap in wireless tech. Concluding Thoughts on Cisco StockExpect 5G to turn Cisco into the quintessential growth and income stock. Put simply, this is not the dot-com boom CSCO. This one-time growth stock has morphed into a more conservative, dividend-oriented company. Payouts have increased every year since 2011. With these rising payouts, it could eventually become a dividend aristocrat. Moreover, with its move into 5G, double-digit profit increases have returned.However, the real benefit may come as 5G represents the next great quantum leap in wireless technology. We already know 5G will probably equip every appliance, light fixture, and meter with wireless technology. However, the real power could come from what we do not imagine.Few could have imagined all of the apps that would come about when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the iPhone in 2007. Investors should expect the same, surprising level of innovation as 5G becomes more prevalent.I do not know what products will emerge. However, regardless of what creation comes about CSCO could serve as the backbone to that technology. Even beyond the financials, that function could become reason enough to buy Cisco stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-03-19,"I didn't think it could get much worse for Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), but it did. Standard and Poor's put the company on CreditWatch negative for failing to file its annual report with the SEC. Down went Kraft Heinz stock hitting a 52-week and all-time low.  Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf there was any doubt that KHC was in the fight of its life, yesterday's dressing down by the credit rating agency is a glaring illustration of how far it has fallen in the past 12-24 months. So, why then did I recently pen 7 Reasons Kraft Heinz Stock Is a Contrarian Buy?Because despite everything, I do believe that Kraft Heinz can be turned around -- but only if these three things are done by the end of 2019. Restore the Balance SheetCompanies that get put on CreditWatch negative are often downgraded (50% chance) within 90 days of going in the credit rating doghouse. While the optics of a $39 billion market cap getting downgraded stings, the financial implications are much worse. In the case of Kraft Heinz, it has way too much debt. As I stated in my February article about Kraft Heinz stock being a contrarian buy, the company has long-term debt of $30.9 billion and just $1.1 billion in cash. With almost no free cash flow, it's going to have to sell some of its brands to pay down debt.  * 7 Financial Stocks to Invest In Today Consider this, while Kraft Heinz's long-term debt is 79% of its market cap, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) has $12.2 billion in long-term debt or 43% of its market cap. Despite making a game-changing acquisition of Blue Buffalo last year for an eye-popping $8 billion, its balance sheet is still much stronger than Kraft Heinz's. Get that down below 50% and investors will warm to Kraft Heinz stock. Fire the CEOI read a great article recently by Forbes contributor Rober Wolcott that talks about Kraft Heinz's controlling owners, 3G Capital, needing to step up to the plate and lead with courage. Walcott wrote March 15:&quot;It's not too late for Kraft Heinz. I personally know some talented executives still with the company. Their iconic brands haven't vanished, but even icons need to continually earn relevance.…To return to growth, Kraft Heinz must turn their cost obsession into prudence and recognize that long-term prosperity requires long-term investment.&quot;Easier said than done. Once a cost cutter, always a cost cutter. However, if it doesn't want to lose investors completely, it's got to reverse course immediately. The best way to do that is to fire existing CEO Bernardo Hees, a 3G lieutenant, and replace him with someone who's got a long history of product innovation and rarely if ever worked for a cost cutter.As former Unilever (NYSE:UN) CEO Paul Polman said in 2017:&quot;Any CEO can decide to think long term. I think it is courageous leadership that is missing.&quot;Wolcott's right. Kraft Heinz is missing courageous leadership. It needs that now more than ever.  Focus on Power BrandsProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) did it. Diageo (NYSE:DEO) did. Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) has always done it. So, there's no doubt that Kraft Heinz can do it. With a little leadership, of course. First, I would identify the top brands by revenues and operating profits. There's no point putting money and effort into a brand that's only got $200 million in sales and is barely profitable. On the other hand, a brand with the same amount of revenue, but good growth prospects and higher operating profits, is worth keeping.Secondly, I wouldn't hesitate to sell both the Kraft and Heinz brands if the writing is on the wall. That said, I doubt either brand is ready for the trash bin. But don't be afraid to make the big decisions even if it means giving up part of your history. Third, I would pour more money into Springboard, Kraft Heinz's platform for growth. 3G Capital are private equity investors. They, more than most, should understand the idea of making an acquisition that becomes the foundational piece of a new growth platform. Little investments can grow into big ones over time. Think 10-20 years down the road and innovation becomes an everyday thought.  The Bottom Line on Kraft Heinz StockWarren Buffett, who I respect immensely, has fallen down on the job when it comes to Kraft Heinz. Not so much because of the losses his company's taken as a result of Kraft Heinz's deteriorating business, but because he's failed to push for change when change is so obviously needed.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them He's a loyal person so that might be tough but if Kraft Heinz doesn't do all of the above -- and soon -- it's long-term health is very much in question.

2019-03-20,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average takes a fair amount of criticism from market pundits and financial experts. Some of that criticism is justified and often stems from just how the index its weighted. But you can't deny that the Dow Jones stocks are still some of the most important companies in the entire U.S. and overall world. With the thirty Dow Jones stocks being powerhouses in their respective fields, they feature enviable moats, large cash flows and big-time profits.And yes, stable and growing dividend payments.Overall, the Dow Jones stocks can be an income seeker's best friend. And just buying the index can lead to some good results. The index tracking SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA) pays a decent 2.25% yield. That's not too shabby at all. However, investors who are serious about finding more income need to dig deeper into Dow Jones stocks and take a look at individual names.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter But which ones? Here are five of the best Dow Jones dividend stocks to buy today.  Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.63%Dow Jones stock Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is proof that old dogs can learn new tricks and that tech's elder statesmen still have plenty of growth behind them.After being the go-to networking firm during the dotcom days, CSCO switched gears to offer more services and other products to go along with their networking equipment. It turns out this was a great idea. Services revenues for the firm continue to surge. Even better is that subscriptions for software and services jumped to be 65% of Cisco's non-equipment revenues. These reoccurring revenues provide the firm with a long runway to keep growth going. And with reoccurring and services profit margins well into the double digits, Cisco has indeed been growing.The firm managed to see double-digit non-GAAP per share growth in the last quarter.And as expected, CSCO has been sharing its growth with shareholders. Since its first dividend payout in 2011, Cisco has upped its dividend by over 480%. That includes the 6% jump at the beginning of this year. This dividend growth rate puts the networking firm in very elite company among Dow Jones stocks.Add in its hefty buyback programs and continued revenue/cash flow growth, CSCO belongs in every income investor's portfolio. Pfizer (PFE)Source:  Kojach Via FlickrDividend Yield: 3.45%Like Cisco, pharmaceutical firm Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been able to find growth and additional sources of revenue in recent years. Like many pharmaceuticals, PFE was facing a major patent cliff as several of its blockbusters -- such as Lipitor and Viagra -- went off patent. However, PFE was able to fill those holes with several other major product launches as well as targeting biosimilars and generic drugs. New cancer and recently launched biotech drugs have set the firm back on the path to growth once more. And with a robust pipeline, PFE should continue to shine in the future.And those drugs will get a chance to shine pretty bright thanks to a spin-off/merger.Pfizer already spun-out its slow-moving animal health division as Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS). However, the firm announced that it plans on merging its consumer health division with GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK). The deal will push some of the boring and slow-growing pieces of its pie outwards and let the higher-margined drugs shine. This should strengthen its cash flows and dividends further.  * 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy Under $10 And speaking of those dividends, PFE recently upped its payout by 5.88% on the back of robust cash flows and increased earnings from its new drugs. That dividend represents the company's 322 consecutive payout and its ninth year of annual dividend increases. Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: Chevron (CVX)Source: swong95765 via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 3.58%Big oil is a great place to find big dividends. That includes top Dow Jones stocks like Chevron (NYSE:CVX). CVX has long been a great place to find higher yields and more recently that yield has gotten better.Like many energy stocks, Chevron dug in deep and cut costs, reduced its drilling and focused on profitable long-term production efforts during the last oil rout. With many of these projects now starting to produce some hefty natural gas and oil, CAPEX spending at the oil giant has decreased. Meanwhile, higher overall oil prices have helped boost cash flows at the firm. All of which has made its dividend that much stronger.After several years of token dividend increases, CVX has finally gotten back to meaningful raises and upped its payout by 6.25% at the start of the year. Today, CVX yields a high 3.58%. That's all thanks to rising cash flows and better margins.Even better is that the firm has recently announced that it plans on doubling down its exposure to low-cost shale in the Permian Basin. Over the next four years, CVX plans on doubling its output in the region to more than 900,000 barrels per day. Given how juicy margins are in the shale, this will only help the firm and its investors further.After a rocky patch, Chevron is back on track to being one of the top Dow Jones stocks. Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3%When it comes to banks in the Dow Jones, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) can't be beaten. As the nation's largest bank, JPM features a huge competitive advantage, large moat and an asset base that only a few competitors can even come close to. And that base continues to get better.Last quarter, JPM managed to see its loans and deposits grow by 2% and 3%, respectively. Meanwhile, credit card sales jumped by 10% year-over-year. This is wonderful news for the bank. Banks like JPM profit from something called net-interest margins. Basically, it's the difference between what they charge on loans and what they hand back on deposits. With rates rising and the economy growing, this has been a boon to JPM's cash flows over the last year or so.Meanwhile, the firm continues to benefit from rising trading, asset management, corporate and high net worth/private banking growth. All of which has helped grow the bank at superb rates. Fellow InvestorPlace contributor Tom Taulli recently highlighted J.P. Morgan's amazing ability to generate strong returns on tangible common equity -- besting many of its peers by a wide margin.  * 7 Video Game Stocks on Steep Discount With the bank trading at 3% yield and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 10, JPM is one heck of a bargain. And with its ability to generate strong returns and cash flows, income seekers should be snagging up shares of this Dow Jones stock with both hands. Top Dow Jones Dividend Stocks: Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 2.8%When it comes to Dow Jones stocks, boring can be beautiful. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a testament to that. Selling Crest toothpaste, Tide laundry soap and Bounty paper towels isn't a very exciting business, but it is stable. And over the decades, that stability has made PG a dividend machine. The firm has managed to raise its dividend for 62 consecutive years and currently offers a hefty 2.8% dividend yield.The best part is that PG has continued to try and improve its business and add some significant innovation to its portfolio.That turnaround is paying benefits in a big way. The firm has managed to pick up some meaningful market share versus rivals, with organic growth growing by over 4%. This was driven by product innovation and is now the second quarter of 4% organic growth. Meanwhile, cost cutting exercises and a lower overall tax rate helped boost margins to 22%. Overall, Procter & Gamble managed to crush expectations when it came to earnings-per-share. With the big beat, it helped cement that PG's turnaround is working.Also underscoring that fact further was Procter & Gamble's massive $4 billion in operating free cash flows.For investors, PG stock isn't insanely exciting, but it can provide a steady stream of dividend growth for years to come. And that makes it one of the best Dow Jones stocks for income seekers.At the time of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-22,"Long-term income investors know that finding dividend stocks with decades of interrupted payments is only part of the winning formula for income investing. Dividend growth matters, too - which is exactly why investors cherish the Dividend Aristocrats.Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that have hiked their dividends every year for at least 25 consecutive years. Rising dividends naturally make these stocks more attractive to new income investors, and steady payout hikes reward existing investors with increasingly higher yields on their shares' original buy-in cost.Most importantly, regular dividend hikes fuel the magic of compounding. Indeed, many of the best stocks of all time have long histories of dividend growth.Since reliable dividend stocks with growing payouts can provide some comfort amid market uncertainty, we took a look at the 11 Dividend Aristocrats with the longest histories of annual dividend increases. After all, when a dividend stock manages to raise its payout through good times and bad, decade after decade, you know management is making its income-reliant shareholders a top priority.

2019-03-29,"If you're looking for stocks to buy, a recent stat from Investors Business Daily should provide you with plenty of ammunition. According to IBD, there were 388 stocks and ETFs at 52-week highs as of March 21 compared to just 73 lows. As I write this, on March 26, there are 49 stocks at 52-week highs trading on the NASDAQ and 153 on the NYSE for a total of 202, down from a few days ago, but still well above the 56 new lows on the two exchanges.So, while the ratio of stocks hitting 52-week highs to those hitting 52-week lows has fallen from 5.3 to 3.6, the reality is that 2019 is turning out to be much improved from the 2018 edition of the market. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo give you an idea of how improved, consider that not one of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 is down in 2019 through March 25. Seven of the 11 sectors are sporting double-digit returns with the best performance coming from Technology (up 17.8%) and the worst from Healthcare, which is down 4.7% YTD.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business If you want to join the party, here are seven stocks to buy as they hit a 52-week high. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)As I write this March 26, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has just hit a 52-week high of $103.48. Up 12% year to date and 38% over the past 52 weeks, PG has never traded this high before. Talk about a comeback. It seems like only yesterday that the company was struggling under the weight of too many underperforming brands.&quot;Less will be much more,&quot; former CEO Alan Lafley told analysts in August 2014. &quot;The objective is growth and much more reliable generation of cash and profit. We're going to be much more agile and adaptable.&quot;Analysts applauded the move to shed more than half its brands, opting to go with those generating more than $1 billion in annual revenue. While it took some time to resonate with investors, the company's move led to a 14% increase in free cash flow since 2014. Just as important, it's converting all of its net profits and then some to free cash flow, well above its seven-year average. Investors who bought this time last year are sitting on a handsome profit. Diageo (DEO)Source: Mustafa Khayat Via FlickrAs I write this, Diageo (NYSE:DEO) has hit a 52-week high of $165.53. Up 16% year to date and 26% over the past 52 weeks, DEO is sitting at an all-time high. So, what's happening to move DEO higher?Well, it seems that consumers are moving from beer to premium spirits, the company's biggest strength, and that's delivering revenue and earnings growth. &quot;We are benefiting from consumer trends where people are drinking better and want better brands and experiences,&quot; CEO Ivan Menezes told CNBC in January. &quot;People are moving to spirits and cocktails in a bigger way from wine and beer, and people are trading up for more premium brands.&quot;Case in point: Diageo's sales in China grew by 20% in the second half of 2018 with particular strength in its scotch and baijiu brands. The economy might be slowing in China, but consumers there are still shelling out for quality spirits. In the first half of 2019, Diageo's sales increased by 5.8%, its operating margin rose by 170 basis points to 35.2%, and free cash flow jumped by 30.8%.   * 8 Genomic Testing Stocks That Can Ease the Sting of Theranos  Business is strong and likely to stay that way for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: Starbucks  Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) hit a 52-week high of $73.19 on March 26. It's up 13% year to date and 31% over the past 52 weeks, SBUX is sitting at an all-time high. I can't remember the first time I recommended Starbucks stock for InvestorPlace readers, but I do know that I gave Howard Schultz and SBUX stock the big thumbs up in July 2013. &quot;It's coming up with new product ideas like its Refreshers line of cold beverages that use coffee innovation to drive revenues and its food business is still in the early stages of development,&quot; I wrote at the time. &quot;Yet investors have barely noticed. Despite generating some of the best results in the company's history, its stock has gained just 27% over the past 52 weeks. To me, that spells value.&quot;SBUX stock is up 98% since July 2013, an excellent return considering it hit the skids last summer, but has recovered nicely. Last April, I argued that Starbucks would be fine without Howard Schultz holding down an executive position at the company. With China keeping CEO Kevin Johnson very busy -- it's opening a new store there at a blistering pace of one every 15 hours. Whatever the latest issue is that gets investors in a twist, Starbucks always figures out how to cope. That's a trait you want in all your investments.    General Mills (GIS)Source: Shutterstock  General Mills (NYSE:GIS) hit a 52-week high of $51.93 on March 26. It's up 32% year to date and 20% over the past 52 weeks. GIS is sitting well off its all-time high of $72.77, hit in July 2016. What's worked at General Mills to get its stock on the move? It's a combination of things.First, it helps to hire a CEO who's not afraid to implement change. Jeff Harmening did just that when he was promoted in March 2017 from COO to chief executive, replacing his boss, Ken Powell, who retired after a decade in the top jobSecondly, it doesn't hurt to raise prices to offset higher costs, which keeps earnings moving higher until organic sales reignite. Lastly, and probably most importantly, General Mills' acquisition of Blue Buffalo in 2018 for $8 billion, sent the company on a completely different trajectory, one that investors have bought hook, line, and sinker.Many thought General Mills overpaid. I don't see it that way. Here's what I said about Blue Buffalo recently. &quot;I'm generally not a fan of big acquisitions because they typically don't generate the synergies and savings projected nor do they provide the expected growth, either,&quot; I wrote March 19. &quot;However, in the case of General Mills, it had to do something because its cereal business was imploding, losing almost 3% growth in revenue over five years. Investors were avoiding GIS stock as a result.&quot;  * 3 Top Tech Stocks to Trade Right Now General Mills announced strong Q3 2019 results March 20 beating the consensus estimate on both the top and bottom line. I believe this is only the tip of the iceberg. Hershey (HSY)Source: mhiguera via FlickrSounding like a bit of broken record, Hershey (NYSE:HSY) hit a 52-week high of $113.40 on March 26. It's up 6% year to date and 20% over the past 52 weeks. HSY is sitting just three dollars shy of its all-time high of $116.49, hit in May 2016. Although the stock market is going like gangbusters at the moment, there have been some rumblings recently about a recession taking hold in late 2019. If that were to happen, Hershey's ideally positioned to ride out the storm. In January, Citigroup (NYSE:C) equity strategy analyst Tobias Levkovich published a list of 50 companies whose pricing power he felt would allow them to outperform in a slowing economy. Hershey made the cut. Levkovich didn't indicate how much investors would be willing to pay for Hershey's ability to raise prices in good times and bad, but it certainly can't hurt as a foundation for considering an investment in the Pennsylvania maker of chocolate bars and candy. Two things I like about Hershey. One is CEO Michelle Buck. In 2018, I recommended Buck along with six other female CEOs, whose stocks investors should buy. I continue to recommend Hershey stock because of her leadership. Also, Hershey's board is 45% women, a very high representation compared to other members of the S&P 500. The second reason I like Hershey is it's controlled by the Hershey Trust, ensuring that short-term moves to boost profits at the expense of the Hershey legacy aren't possible. You might not like dual-class share structures, but in instances like this, they're an absolute must. Church & Dwight (CHD)Source:  slgckgc via Flickr (Modified)  Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) hit a 52-week high of $69.54 on March 26. It's up 4% year to date and 46% over the past 52 weeks. CHD is sitting at its all-time high, hit on March 26. I consider Church & Dwight to be the poor cousin of Procter & Gamble. Its brands aren't nearly as flashy as P&G's, most people wouldn't know who either Church or Dwight was and it's a much smaller company making it far less attractive to blue-chip investors. That said, it's one of my favorite stocks of all time. &quot;It buys brands with high margins and market shares, doesn't overpay for them, and then grows them organically through the process mentioned previously, all the while converting free cash flow at a better rate than anyone in the industry,&quot; I wrote in April 2016The process I speak of is Church & Dwight's three-point plan: It creates innovative new products and brand extensions, it spends considerable amounts advertising its handful of power brands, and then increases a product's distribution as extensive geographically and by type of market as it possibly can. It's hard work. Very few can do what it does.   * 4 Pot Stocks That Could Be Fizzling Out That's why it hasn't had a down year in over a decade. Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr  Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) hit a 52-week high of $345.63 on March 26. It's up 40% year to date and 65% over the past 52 weeks. ULTA is sitting at its all-time high, hit on March 26. If you're like me and have followed the company's stock for some years, you'll remember the specialty retailer's June 2017 swoon that saw it lose more than a quarter of its value in two months. In August 2017, I recommended investors buy its shares before and after announcing Q2 2017 results, regardless of the direction of its share price. I made that call because of my confidence in the company's growth strategy.Here's how it played out. Ulta shares closed trading August 24, 2017, at $233.71 a share. It announced Q2 2017 revenues and earnings that beat analyst expectations. However, investors didn't like the slowdown in same-store-sales growth, so its shares dropped by 9.1% on the next day's trading. It then spent the next 15 months in a trading range between $200-$300. So, if you bought 100 shares of ULTA stock on August 24, 2017, at the high of $247.30 and 100 shares on August 25, 2017, at the high of $217.80, you'd be up 47% in the 20 months since. I'm not saying this to toot my own horn. Instead, I'm saying it because I believe that the earnings momentum it continues to enjoy is going to carry on into fiscal 2019 and beyond. I live in Canada.  There isn't a single Ulta store open here. The last time I looked, Canadians didn't have a problem shopping at Sephora. I doubt they'd have a problem buying at Ulta. Between Canada and e-commerce, the pathway to growth is alive and well.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-29,"After a half-decade of slimming down, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is telling Wall Street it's in fighting shape and ready to rumble for growth.The owners of PG stock  shouldn't care.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)What most investors want from PG stock is a dividend. They want to buy an attractive yield and watch it grow, along with that dividend.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business That's what they have been getting, despite all the company's noise and its strategy shifts. At its Mar. 29 early-afternoon price of about $103.50, PG stock's quarterly dividend of almost 72 cents per share, most recently paid last month, yields 2.79%. It's usually about 3%. The low yield indicates a hot stock, and indeed the shares are up nearly 12% so far in 2019, in-line with the S&P 500.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs American investors continue to age, PG stock is becoming fashionable. A Rising TidePG's brands, which once included everything from Folger's coffee and Pringle's potato chips to Duracell batteries and Crisco shortening, have been whittled down this decade into what the company defines as &quot;care&quot; products. The category includes-baby-care products like Pamper's diapers, laundry-care products like Tide soap, and oral-care products like Crest toothpaste.These brands delivered $66.8 billion of sales for the year ending last June, $9.8 billion of which reached the net-income line, equaling an impressive net margin of nearly 15%. PG's operating cash flow has been expanding and should top $15 billion. Its balance sheet is strong, with $21.5 billion in long-term debt buttressed by about $12 billion in cash and short-term investments. With 2.5 billion shares, PG stock's current dividend costs about $7.2 billion per year.PG has been dropping brands to cope with retailers' continuing march to store brands that seem especially popular in the food sector, as supermarket chains like Aldi and Trader Joe's have become exclusively private label, and giant retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) are finding that the food business has become profitable. PG's cleaning brands also lend themselves to becoming services, like Mr. Clean Car Washes and Tide dry cleaners and laundries. PG Stock Is a Dividend AristocratPG stock is not for everyone, even though its recent history would indicate it might be.While the shares have been outperforming the market over the last year, up 23.6% against an average S&P stock loss of 3.7%, Procter & Gamble stock is up only 29% over the last five years, against the S&P's 50% gain.It's the quarterly dividend, carefully calibrated by management to the thousandth of a penny, that is the star of PG stock. It's up an average of about 7 cents per quarter over the last five years,as it stood at 44 cents per share ten years ago. Over ten years, the dividend of PG stock  is up over 60%, and the stock price is up 118%. That's what dividend aristocrats can deliver.It seems to make sense to grab this kind of stock when the iron is cold, when it's less fashionable. But its yield is lowest when the chance of a dividend hike is highest. Analysts expect PG stock's dividend to rise 4% this year, to about 74.5 cents. That would bring the yield to 2.9%. The Bottom Line on Procter & Gamble StockP&G stock  is a long-time dividend aristocrat, but such stocks are in fashion right now, so PG's current yield is below its average for the decade.Its current yield is equivalent to that of a 30-year government bond, although investors will have to pay taxes on it.With Procter & Gamble stock, investors are betting the dividend will keep ratcheting up, slowly, and that time will work its magic, delivering a return on the underlying asset.That's a bet a lot of conservative investors are happy to make right now.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Its strong balance sheet, collection of impressive brands and consistent dividend all give long-term investors a reason to stay with the name. So with earnings on tap Tuesday morning, should investors be nibbling JNJ stock?Source: Shutterstock For the upcoming quarter, analysts currently expect earnings of $2.04 per share on revenue $19.61 billion. Should Johnson & Johnson stock hit these consensus expectations, it will result in a year-over-year (YoY) decline of 4.9% and 2%, respectively.When it comes to the full-year numbers, analysts are looking for revenue to fall 60 basis points YoY to $81.05 billion, but for earnings to grow 4.9%. In both metrics, the ensuing quarters are supposed to get better for JNJ. Better-than-expected first-quarter results could lift the estimates for the rest of the year. Consider the fact that JNJ stock has beat both estimates for six straight quarters and this becomes a real possibility, although management's outlook will certainly be important.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWill this be enough to lift the stock? We'll find out on Tuesday. Valuing Johnson & Johnson StockThe 2019 growth profile isn't all that impressive for Johnson & Johnson stock, although the numbers for 2020 are better. Analysts expect revenue growth to turn positive and expand by 4.3%. Earnings growth is forecast to accelerate from 4.9% to 6.5% in 2020 to $9.14 per share.Based on this year's numbers, JNJ stock trades at just under 16 times earnings. Ordinarily, paying 16 times earnings for negative revenue growth and sub-5% earnings growth is unattractive, to put it kindly. But JNJ is no average name.  * 7 Mid-Cap Stocks to Find the Market's Sweet Spot The company has a strong balance sheet and steady cash flow growth. At the end of fiscal 2018, operating cash flow stood at $22.2 billion while free cash flow stood at more than $18 billion. These are impressive numbers and help explain the strength behind its dividend.Now paying out 2.65%, it's not the largest yield on Wall Street, but it's one of the most dependable. JNJ stock hasn't just paid a dividend for more than five decades, but it has raised its payout for an impressive 56 consecutive years. While this lags other dividend studs like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), it shouldn't be ignored. Further, that dividend should get another boost this month.J&J does have an issue with its talc powder products and ensuing lawsuits. While that may cause bumps along the way, it will not be the iceberg that sinks the ship. JNJ stock will live on, and long-term investors shouldn't be shaken from their position on that worry.On that note, let's look at the charts. Trading JNJ Stock  Click to Enlarge After a strong rebound out of the December lows, JNJ stock has been consolidating under $140 for more than six weeks now. $140 is clearly short-term resistance, while $135 appears to be support. Worth mentioning is that the 61.8% retracement for the 52-week range is just under $136, a level JNJ stock had been struggling with over the past few sessions.On Monday the stock jumped over this mark, although it's still below both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. This sets up an interesting situation for JNJ stock now.Will the earnings results be strong enough to justify a move over the 20-day and 50-day moving averages? If so, I want to see how it handles $140. If JNJ gets over this mark, I want to see $140 act as support going forward.Should JNJ stock pull back instead, I want to see how it does against the 200-day moving average and possibly lower at $130. Between $130 and $140 and shares can stay rangebound, while a move outside of that range can create a change in character in JNJ stock. In short, it can create either a breakout or a breakdown.We'll know more on Tuesday. Traders should wait to see the results from earnings, while some long-term investors may feel comfortable adding to the name ahead of time.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.52%.With record highs a stone's throw away, bullish option flows continue to suggest a retest is on the horizon. In the options pits, call activity surged yesterday, pushing overall volume back above average readings. Specifically, about 20.2 million calls and 14.8 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, the action at the CBOE mirrored that of the previous day with the single-session equity put/call volume holding steady at 0.58. The 10-day moving average remains at 0.59.Options traders flocked to the following three stocks: Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).Let's dig into the details: Proctor & Gamble (PG)The drumbeat of new highs continued for Proctor & Gamble on Tuesday. With the day's gains, the consumer staples stock pushed its year-to-date gains to 15.9%. Chart watchers continue to salivate over the consistency of its uptrend. The series of higher highs and lows has been relentless in 2019, and all major moving averages are rising beneath.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm Despite the substantial rise, PG stock still boasts a meaty dividend at 2.82%, and it is the allure of cash flow that landed the company atop yesterday's leaderboard. Traders harnessed the power of call options for short-term control of PG stock ahead of Wednesday's ex-dividend date. Its next quarterly dividend payment of 74.6 cents will be paid to shareholders.As is usually the case ahead of dividend dates, options traders went cuckoo for call options.On the options trading front, traders came after calls with a vengeance. Activity exploded to 1,232% of the average daily volume, with 204,899 total contracts traded; 85% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility drifted sideways on the session at 20%, which places it at the 40th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of $1.37 or 1.3%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Traders played whack-a-mole with UNH stock after the healthcare company reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed expectations. UnitedHealth raked in $3.60 of earnings-per-share on revenue of $60.31 billion. Both metrics topped analyst forecasts.And yet, the early morning gains melted as the recent proposals for &quot;Medicare-for-all&quot; by some Democrats running for president took root. Here's the money quote from CEO David Wichmann during the company's conference call: &quot;The wholesale disruption of American health care would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilize the nation's health system, and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best.&quot;UNH stock ended down 4.12% on the session, falling to a new 52-week low.On the options trading front, calls ruled the roost despite the early-morning rug pull. Activity grew to 881% of the average daily volume, with 160,336 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 65% of the total.The typical &quot;volatility crush&quot; in implied volatility following earnings was held at bay by the high uncertainty that came out of the conference call. Implied volatility remains sky high at 34% or the 73rd percentile of its one-year range. Traders continue to expect daily moves of $4.69 or 2.1%. Qualcomm (QCOM)An unexpected settlement to Qualcomm's multi-year legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was announced yesterday, and the chipmaker is zooming to the moon. When the news hit the wires, QCOM stock rocketed 20% higher. The buying has continued unabated in after-hours trading, and QCOM is up another 12%. That means it will open at a new four-and-a-half year high.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth The only resistance level that remains between Qualcomm and new record highs is the 2014 peak of $81.97. And with the rapid repricing going on over the past 24 hours, the stock could get there in a hurry.As you might expect, calls dominated the day by a large margin. Total activity climbed to 492% of the average daily volume, with 361,393 contracts traded; 80% of the day's take fell on the call side of the ledger.Implied volatility dropped to 34% placing it at the 56th percentile of its one-year range.

2019-04-18,"Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) will announce its earnings next Tuesday before the opening bell. Despite the venerable personal-care products maker's reputation as a defensive dividend payer, PG stock has rallied massively over the last year.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Unfortunately, the rally may have left new investors with less incentive to buy PG stock. With the multiples of PG stock having risen to multi-year highs and its profit growth remaining moderate at best, investors should probably think twice about buying Procter and Gamble at these levels.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees  Expect Slight Earnings, Revenue IncreasesFor PG's fiscal third quarter, analysts' consensus earnings  per share estimate is $1.03. That's 3% higher than Q3 of 2018 when the company earned $1 per share of PG stock. Analysts on average predict revenues of $16.32 billion, a slight gain from the $16.28 billion the company generated during last year's Q3.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the surface, PG appears to be performing well. Trading near its all-time highs, PG stock is 50% above its levels of one year ago. That seems unusual for a stock that traders tend to buy for its dividend.After the company raised the dividend of PG stock this year, the payout has risen for  63 straight years, the fourth-longest streak on Wall Street. PG has paid a dividend every year since 1890. Currently at $2.87 per share, the payout yields 2.75%. Will Investors Continue to Buy PG Stock After the Surge?The impressive rally of PG stock has made it less appealing.  The dividend yield of PG stock was about 3.5% this time last year, versus 2.75% now. Moreover, PG's price-earnings (PE) ratio has risen to 25.74. In fairness, Procter & Gamble's peers such as Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB), and Clorox (NYSE:CLX) trade at comparable or higher multiples.Still, the current PE ratio of PG is above its average PE over the last five years of 23.5. It's also well above the mid-teen multiples Procter & Gamble was awarded in the early part of the decade. Also,  Wall Street expects PG to report solid, but unimpressive, profit increases. On average, analysts forecast 5.2% profit growth for this fiscal year and 7% next year. Those increases appear too low to justify the current PE ratio of PG stock.Furthermore, even after spinning off numerous brands in the middle part of the decade, PG stock remains vulnerable. For all of its accolades, the competitive moat of Procter and Gamble begins and ends with brand recognition and store-shelf space. Consumers know and love PG's brands such as Tide laundry detergent and Bounty paper towels. However, thanks to e-commerce, consumers can more easily find comparable products at lower prices.I do not think the increased competition will wipe out PG stock. I also do not believe that the rising dividend of PG stock will be threatened. Still, the company may have difficulty growing its revenue, making PG's current valuation difficult to justify. Going into earnings, few investors have an incentive to buy Procter and Gamble at these levels. Final Thoughts on PG StockGiven the recent increases in its price, PG stock will probably struggle to move higher in the near-term. As a result, I see no reason to buy PG 's shares ahead of its earnings.Procter and Gamble enjoyed an unexpected but impressive run over the last year. However, consumer defensive stocks better known for paying dividends rarely have such rallies. Despite increasing competition and analysts' belief that the company's  revenue growth was anemic last quarter, I think the stock's dividend will continue to rise. However, other stocks feature annual dividend hikes and lower valuations.For now, income-oriented investors will probably find higher overall returns elsewhere.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-23,"What a surge we got in the stock market today, with the S&P 500 taking out its prior record closing from 2018. Same for the Nasdaq. As nice as it is to see stocks moving higher, it does create a less attractive risk/reward for new longs. Let's see what top stock trades we can find as earnings continue to roll in.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is perhaps the most notable mover on the day. See to it that the stock now stays over former resistance, which was laid out the other day. I would also like to see it stay over its key Fibonacci retracement levels now. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: Procter & GambleInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is how you know Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) came into the print too hot. The company beat on earnings and revenue estimates and bumped its full-year outlook. Still, shares fell 3.2% on Tuesday.The decline drops PG out of its rising channel and puts downside targets back on the table. Given how strong the stock has been and given that its report was more a sell-the-news event rather than panic on poor results, the first spot to look is the 50-day moving average.  * 7 Digital Ad Stocks That Deserve Your Attention Right Now Should $100 to $101 fail to buoy PG, a decline into the mid-$90s is possible before buyers step in. I want to see where support comes in, and what happens on the ensuing rebound. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Kohl's=Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) stock is rocketing higher on Tuesday, up 12%, on news that the company would expand its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).$80-ish is pretty clear resistance for the stock, which is erupting off uptrend support while the 20-week is crossing above the 50-week moving average. The latter development could signal a shift into bulls' favor as far as long-term momentum goes.However, in the intermediate term, I want to see how KSS does with uptrend resistance and the $80 level. A push through could create a new leg higher. A rejection provides a buy-the-dip opportunity. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: RokuShares of Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) are popping nicely on Tuesday, up about 8% following a bullish analyst note.The stock is gapping up through the 20-day and 50-day moving average, a rally that's threatened to stall if shares pullback over the next session or two. However, I have my eyes on a larger level, that being downtrend resistance currently near $67.50.Should it get there, I expect Roku to run into some sellers. If a pullback ensues, see where the buyers step back in. Should we get a decline back to downtrend support and the 200-day, Roku is worth a shot on the long side, at least for a bounce.This one has been struggling, so it has to prove that momentum is back to trust it on the long side. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Small CapsWith FAANG names roaring back, small caps may not be the main focus right now. However, the direction of the IWM has been a leading indicator at times.The good news for bulls is that iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) is up 1.6% on Tuesday and outpacing all other indices. That said, it has some catching up to do.I loved the little pullback we got last week, with three straight declines, the last two of which tested down into moving average support and bounce to close basically flat each day. With the 20-day, 50-day and 200-day all just below the current price and resistance sitting at current levels, the strong rally in the IWM looks great.Should it breakout over this level, the IWM has room to run. While the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow are all hovering near their highs, the IWM could still run another $12 and not hit them. I really like a breakout over $158. Below last week's lows near $154.75 and I'd change my thesis. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Johnson & JohnsonWhen Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported earnings last week, the stock flirted with a big move over $140. However, that rally faded intraday, with JNJ closing near $138. That showed that JNJ was not yet ready for the breakout, although stalling at $140 should be no surprise. Ahead of the event, we wrote, &quot;$140 is clearly short-term resistance.&quot;A pullback into the 20-day and 50-day moving average held, meaning JNJ had reset enough to warrant another look. Now here we are at $140 again, with JNJ stock threatening to move even higher. A close over $140 has me interested on the long side.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Below the 50-day and I'll lose my interest. Above $140 opens the door to $146+ going forward.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long ROKU and AMZN.

2019-04-23,"CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) is an organization that should do well in any part of the economic cycle, since we all need medicine and healthcare products from time to time. So on paper,  CVS stock  has similar characteristics to Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrBut unlike those latter names, CVS and other retail pharmacy stocks have not done well over the past few years. Since August 2015, CVS has dropped over 50%. Even worse, the owners of CVS stock have nothing on the horizon to cheer about, and CVS has tumbled 20% since January.Confronting retail pharmacy stocks, including CVS, is a double whammy of potentially crippling headwinds. First, the retail pharmacy giant must address political and public anger against rising healthcare costs. After embarrassing controversies such as the &quot;pharma bro&quot; scandal, the American electorate will make this a pivotal issue next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt Not only that, but political momentum appears to be moving further against retail pharmacy stocks. That's  troubling for the owners of CVS stock.  Specifically, popular presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders have supported initiatives like the &quot;Medicare for All Act.&quot; Rising stars like Democratic and economic firebrand Andrew Yang are guaranteed to make &quot;Medicare for All&quot; a political talking point.That is already a huge problem for retail pharmacy stocks. But the other dark cloud impacting CVS stock is competition. I'm not just talking about individual players in a hurting sector cutting each others' throats. Rather, I'm calling out the giant gorilla in the room: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).I love Amazon because it's an unrivaled American success story. But let's also be honest: Amazon's success has come at the expense of other American businesses. Now that AMZN has its eyes on retail pharmacy, it's no wonder why CVS stock is so volatile. Threats Rattle CVS, But They Won't Be FatalNo matter how you look at it, CVS stock is incredibly risky. Unfortunately, recent developments have put more pressure on CVS. But as bad as things have gotten, the headwinds facing CVS stock are not completely devastating.While the political noose appears to be tightening its grip on CVS, this dynamic also offers opportunity. Sure, CVS and other pharmacy stocks probably won't benefit anymore from overpriced prescription medicine. However, if the Democrats take over the White House next year - and that's a real possibility - millions of underserved Americans will have access to quality healthcare insurance.These Democratic policies will cause many Americans who are buying drugs in foreign countries to obtain them in the U.S. instead.Earlier this year, NPR highlighted the case of Michelle Fenner. Doctors diagnosed her son with Type 1 diabetes almost a decade ago, meaning he requires daily insulin shots to live. Last year,  a three-month supply of insulin rose to $3,700.In Tijuana, Mexico, however, Fenner only has to pay an amazingly low $600. Such extraordinary discounts have inspired up to 320,000 Americans to travel abroad for healthcare reasons each year. Therefore, cost-cutting measures may initially hurt the profit margins of retail pharmacy stocks. But at the same time, the retailers would also capture revenue that previously went to foreign countries.That's not all. According to Harvard Health Publishing, millions of Americans skimp on medication because of their exorbitant costs. Again, a cap on costs would initially hurt the profit margins of pharmaceutical retailers. But in the long run, pharmacy retailers will obtain revenue from new sources, boosting CVS stock. Amazon Can't Quite Disrupt CVSAs I mentioned earlier, disruptive competition presents a serious threat to CVS stock. Amazon succeeded in disrupting multiple retail segments. Therefore, it's only natural to assume that AMZN will also cripple CVS.However, pharmacy retail is unlike other retail categories because consumers often need their medication right way. For instance, if someone has an especially explosive case of diarrhea, he's not going to wait three to five business days for a treatment to be shipped to him. Instead, he needs relief right away.As a result, I think Amazon's overall impact on pharmacies will be similar to its impact on the home-improvement sector. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) must contend with competition from the e-commerce giant. However, traditional brick-and-mortar locations serve consumers looking for home-improvement products well. They get what they want, when they want it. That attribute is much more important for people who need drugs.Having said all that, I'm not entirely gung-ho on CVS stock. The underlying company has a huge debt load. Moreover, it has struggled to adapt to its industry's changing landscape.But it's also very possible that, in the wake of the decline of CVS stock, the bad news is already reflected in the shares. Once investors realize that the bad news isn't all that terrible, CVS could rally, at least for awhile.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-29,"Alongside the rest of the market, Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock has been on a tear in 2019, rising 13% as the consumer staples giant has reported favorable numbers against the backdrop of improving economic and financial-market conditions.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Ostensibly, the company's current outlook is good enough to support further gains by PG stock. PG is turning things around, leveraging non-cyclical tailwinds in cosmetics to drive its best sales and profit growth in several years. As long as those tailwinds persist, and the company's numbers remain good, then PG stock could arguably continue on its uptrend.But that bull thesis on PG stock is challenged by valuation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 U.S. Shale Oil Stocks to Buy as Prices Rise PG stock is trading at an unusually rich and historically unsustainable valuation. Across essentially every important valuation metric, Procter & Gamble stock is trading 10% or more above its average historical valuation, and it carries  a notable premium to its peers in the consumer staples and household products sectors.PG's growth outlook is improving, but it isn't good enough to warrant the super-charged valuation of PG stock. As a result, worries about the valuation of Procter & Gamble stock could ultimately keep the shares stuck around $100. PG's Performance Has ImprovedP&G's performance has steadily improved over the past few quarters.For the past several years, P&G has largely been a stagnant company, defined by 1%-3% organic sales growth, margin turbulence, and slightly negative to slightly positive core profit growth. But over the past few quarters, this company has broken out of its multi-year stagnancy by reporting some of the best numbers investors have seen in a long while.Over the past three quarters, its sales growth, excluding acquisitions, has been in the 4%-5% range, led by big gains in cosmetics. Meanwhile, its core profits, excluding currency fluctuations, have been rising at a steady double-digit-percentage rate, including a 15% pop last quarter.In other words, P&G is firing on all cylinders right now. This new, higher growth trajectory should continue, with cosmetics as the big driver.Largely owing to the widespread proliferation of camera apps, consumers today are increasingly concerned with how they look. This has led to record results across the whole cosmetics/beauty sector. As long as the strength of this sector persists, then so, too, will P&G's higher-than-normal growth rates.All in all, the outlook of P&G has substantially improved over the past several quarters, and that's why PG stock has rallied 40%-plus over the past year. The Valuation of PG Stock Reflects Improvement… and Then SomeAlthough PG's performance is improving, the valuation of PG stock already more than reflects these improvements. Consider the following:  * The dividend yield is at decade-low levels. It's been this low three times before over the past decade (early 2010, late 2013, and late 2014). Each time, PG stock proceeded to either drop or stay flat over the next several months.  * The price-sales multiple on PG is nearly four. That's almost  a 20% premium to the stock's  average sales multiple over the last five years.  * The price-cash flow multiple on PG is at 18, roughly 10% above its average cash-flow multiple of the last five years.  * The forward price-earnings multiple is above 22, nearly 10% above its average forward earnings multiple of the last five years.  * PG stock's EV/EBITDA multiple is at 16, which is nearly 20% above its average EBITDA multiple of the last five tears.  * The stock's forward P/E multiple of 23 is notably above the average P/E multiple of consumer staples stocks (19) and the  average P/E multiple of household products stocks (19).Clearly, fundamental improvements are already priced into PG stock.Overall, I see P&G as a company that can leverage non-cyclical beauty tailwinds to drive low-single-digit-percentage revenue growth over the next several years. Coupled with tepid margin expansion and some buybacks of Procter & Gamble stock, that should reasonably drive 5%-7% profit growth. That would put PG's 2025 profits at somewhere around $6.30 per share.Based on a  forward multiple of 22, which is average for household products stocks,  that equates to a fiscal 2024 price target for PG stock just south of $140. Discounted back by 7% per year (I reduced my normal 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that implies a fiscal 2019 price target of roughly $100. The Bottom Line on PG StockP&G is improving  But the 40%-plus rally of PG stock already reflects those improvements, and further gains in the near- to medium-term look unlikely due to what has become the overly stretched valuation of PG. As a result, the big rally of Procter & Gamble stock may ultimately end soon.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-10,"Since late March, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock has been in a fairly tight trading range. But next Tuesday we may see some action. Yes, the company will report its fiscal third quarter results. No doubt, it will be a critical, as investors will want to get a sense of how the Canadian recreational market is tracking, and after the Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) letdown, there might be some concern about Aurora stock.Source: Shutterstock Now as for the prior quarter for Aurora stock, the company handily beat its own estimates. Revenues hit $40.7 million for the quarter, up a sizzling 83% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Note that the company had put out a forecast of $37.6 million.Although, the losses were hefty, coming to $178.6 million. A big reason for this has been the aggressive M&A strategy, which means that the company has to make adjustments for mark-to-mark accounting. Consider that there have been 15 deals since the summer of 2016.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dangerous Dividend Stocks to Stay Far Away From  A Closer Look at Aurora StockSo what about the expectation for Aurora stock for Q3? Well, as should be no surprise, the growth is likely to continue at a robust pace. The consensus is for revenues to come to $55.3 million and the loss be 4 cents a share. But given that the cannabis opportunity in Canada is in the nascent stages, the forecast is likely to be more of an educated guess.There were certainly other notable highlights during the quarter. Here's a look:  * The company signed a binding agreement to acquire Chemi Pharmaceutical, which is a privately-held Ontario lab that focuses on analytics for the pharma and cannabis industries. A key asset is the Health Canada Drug Establishment Licence that allows for performing certified GMP compliant quality control testing. The company will be merged into Aurora's Anandia Laboratories subsidiary.  * Aurora announced it has purchased the remaining shares of Hemco, which is a top provider of hemp-based foods, fiber and nutraceuticals. The company is also commissioning its 56,000 square foot hemp processing facility for the extraction of CBD.  * The company completed its acquisition of Whistler Medical Marijuana Corporation, which is one of the top premium cannabis brands in Canada. The deal should allow for expansion in both medical and consumer markets. Consider that the production capacity is expandable to over 15,000 kg.  * Aurora received approval to sell cannabis oils to German pharmacies. In fact, the company is already the market leader in the country. Bottom Line on ACB StockWhen it comes to ACB stock, there are both short-term and long-term tailwinds. No doubt, right now much of the growth will come from the Canadian market. The good news is that the company has been able to effectively scale its operations. Production is expected to go from 150,000 kg per year to more than 500,000 kg per year by mid-2020.As for the long-term catalysts for ACB stock, there is the medical business. The company has about 40 clinical trials and has also built a strong distribution footprint in Europe and Latin America. Just a small number of new therapeutics can have a big impact on the top-line.But there is another key factor for ACB stock: The company has appointed Nelson Peltz as a Strategic Advisor. He is the CEO and founding partner of the Trian Fund, which is a top investment firm that's focused on the consumer products sector.  It has stakes in companies such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ).In other words, Nelson will likely be critical in helping ACB find major strategic partners to help propel the growth, similar to what other cannabis firms like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Cronos have done. So yes, on the earnings call, it's a good bet that analysts will want to hear how things are progressing on this front.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-05-14,"Thanks to another well-timed tweet by President Donald Trump, U.S. equities are bouncing back on Tuesday on fresh hope for a U.S.-China trade deal.

Here are five worth a look:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Consumer Stocks :Procter & Gamble (PG)Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) shares have shaken off the broad market pressure to keep marching higher, inching towards a new record high as it keeps riding support near its 50-day moving average. Shares were also barely affected by the volatility seen late last summer as well, continuing an uptrend that started in April 2018 that has seen shares gain more than 50%.The company is scheduled to next report results on July 30 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1.05 per share on revenues of $16.9 billion. When the company last reported on April 23, earnings of $1.06 per share beat estimates by two cents on a 1.1% rise in revenues. Coca-Cola (KO)Shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are rising up to challenge resistance from double-top highs near the $50-a-share threshold. Zooming out, the stock has been in a steady if somewhat choppy uptrend since the 2009 bear market low -- the very definition of what you would expect from a well-run consumer staples company.  * 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Trade War Reignites Results will next be reported on July 25 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 62 cents per share on revenues of $9.4 billion. When the company last reported on April 23, earnings of 48 cents per share beat estimates by two cents on a 5.2% rise in revenues. Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Shares of Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) are pushing higher to challenge highs the stock last set in early 2018. This continues a sideways channel that has been in place since the middle of 2016. Shares were recently upgraded to &quot;buy&quot; by analysts at Zacks, who are looking for a $80-a-share price target.The company will next report results on July 26 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 72 cents per share on revenues of $3.9 billion. When the company last reported on April 26, earnings of 67 cents per share beat estimates by a penny on a 2.9% drop in revenues. Management reaffirmed its relatively bright 2019 outlook as well. General Mills (GIS)General Mills (NYSE:GIS) shares are continuing to attempt a breakout up and over three-month resistance near the $52-a-share level, setting up a run at its early 2018 highs near the $57-a-share level. Such a move would be worth a gain of nearly 10% from here. Shares have been trading at a discount to the average consumer packaged goods stock this year, making its relative price stability even more valuable in these volatile times.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days The company is scheduled to next report results on June 26 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 76 cents per share on revenues of $4.3 billion. When the company last reported on March 20, earnings of 83 cents per share beat estimates by 14 cents on an 8.1% rise in revenues. GoPro (GPRO)GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) is something of an unusual pick for this list, on account of its position as a turnaround consumer electronics name. Shares have cratered since reaching a high in late 2015, losing some 95% of their value into the low set in December. Since then, shares have been scrambling higher and are pushing up and over their April high today.The company will next report results on August 1 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of four cents per share on revenues of $301 million. When the company last reported on May 9, a loss of seven cents per share beat estimates by two cents on a 20.1% rise in revenues.As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-23,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in March 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]Cannabidiol (CBD) is emerging as a red-hot category of the marijuana industry. CBD consists of compounds in the cannabis sativa plant that do not produce a high. In fact, over the years, CBDs have been shown to have powerful therapeutic effects.Now it looks like the U.S. market could open up in a big way for this type of cannabis and several CBD stocks are gaining traction. The reason: In December, Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill, which declared that CBD would no longer be treated as an illegal substance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo how big could this opportunity be?  Well, according to research from the Brightfield Group, the market in the U.S. could hit $22 billion by 2022.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend No doubt, this could move the needle for marijuana stocks -- and here's a look at seven that stand out:   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Cronos Group (CRON)Cronos Group (NYSE:CRON) operates a vertically integrated cannabis platform, with a presence across five continents. In terms of the CBD opportunity, the company recently struck a strategic partnership with Gingko Bioworks, which has raised $430 million. The company's founder, Tom Knight, is known as the &quot;father of synthetic biology&quot; and his innovations -- such as with software to print DNA -- should allow for the creation of cannabinoids at a massive scale. This is critical because it can be difficult to produce pure forms that are cost-effective and precise.CRON also has the advantage of substantial financial resources to commercialize its cannabinoids. Last December, Altria (NYSE:MO) invested $1.8 billion into the company for a 45% stake. The deal is certainly a validation of CRON but it will also allow for much broader distribution and improved product development.Of course, a company like MO does engage in substantial due diligence before making an investment. In the company's Q4 earnings call, CEO Howard Willard said: &quot;We believe the growth opportunities are significant and will extend across the globe as cannabis markets open. Selecting the right partner in this category was critical and we've done just that. Cronos strong management team has built unique capabilities to compete globally across the medicinal, recreational and nutraceutical categories.&quot;   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Aurora Cannabis (ACB)Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), a Canadian based cannabis producer, has been building up its CBD business. Part of this has been with its investments in industrial hemp production, such as with the Radient facility in Edmonton. It is expected to get as much as 10,000 kilos per day.Next, ACB has been focused on revving up its product offerings. On its Q2 earnings call, Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley said the company is poised &quot;to launch a broad line of CBD based wellness product in the near future.&quot;What's more, ACB has been aggressive with its dealmaking. For example, it has increased its equity position in Hempco and purchased Agropro, which is Europe's largest hemp producer.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend Something else to keep in mind: Legendary billionaire investor Nelson Peltz has joined the company as an advisor. This is certainly a major vote of confidence. He not only has deep access to investment capital but a strong network of potential partners, especially in the consumer goods industry. Some of his investments include stakes in PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ).   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Charlotte's Web (CWBHF)The inspiration for the founding of Charlotte's Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF) was a CNN documentary -- in 2013 -- about Charlotte Figi, whose health was significantly improved because of a hemp extract.Fast forward to today: The company is the No. 1 brand for the hemp-derived CBD market in the U.S. It definitely helps that it has distribution across more than 3,000 retail locations.And yes, growth has been strong. In Q3, revenues jumped by 57% to $17.7 million and adjusted EBITDA came to $5.4 million, up 31%.To better capitalize on the CBD opportunity, CWBHF issued $71.5 million in stock. This will be for cultivation and production to meet surging demand. Here's what the company's CEO, Hess Moallem, had to say: &quot;In general, broader consumer awareness of the benefits of cannabinoids, namely cannabidiol (CBD), and whole plant hemp extract is driving increased uptake in both our retail channels and within our e-commerce platform.&quot;In other words, it seems like a pretty good bet that the growth will continue for some time.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE)Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) is a clinical-stage biotech company that develops cannabinoid therapies for a variety of rare diseases. They include:  * Fragile X Syndrome (FXS): This is a developmental disability that has been known to cause autism spectrum disorder. FXS impacts 71,000 people in the U.S. and there are no drug indications for it.  * Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEE): This is an epilepsy syndrome that involves severe cognitive impairment. About 45,000 children and adolescents have this in the U.S.  * Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): This includes autism and Asperger's syndrome. ASD affects less than 1 million pediatric and adolescent patients.     * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend ZYNE's main candidate is Zygel, which is a CBD formulation gel for transdermal delivery. As for the FXS treatment, there is expected to be a pivotal data release in the second half of this year. And if the trial is positive, then the company will file a New Drug Application (NDA) for Zygel in the first half of 2020.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Canopy Growth (CGC)Since 2016, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has been building its CBD business, with a focus on consumer packaged goods. The company has since created a vertically integrated platform for that includes a set of technologies that have pending patents. What's more, the hemp division is expected to yield 7,000 kilos of hemp-derived CBD on an annual basis. Granted, this cannot be used in the U.S. market. Yet CGC is likely to be a solid partner. For example, the company struck a deal with Martha Stewart's Sequential Brands Group, so as to develop CBD remedies for pets.It helps that CGC has substantial resources, which came from a mega $4 billion investment from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). STZ has a strong global footprint -- with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada -- as well as a set of well-known consumer brands, such as Corona Extra, Corona Light, Modelo Especial, Modelo Negra and Pacifico. All in all, there is quite a bit of synergy for CGC.In the meantime, the company is growing at a staggering pace. In Q3, its revenues soared by 282% to $83 million.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization:GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH)The origins of GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH) go back to 1998. It was then that Dr. Geoffrey Guy and Dr. Brian Whittle co-founded the company to focus on developing therapies using cannabinoid formulations to target areas like epilepsy, glioma and schizophrenia.As of today, the lead product is a liquid formulation of a CBD, called Epidiolex, which received FDA approval in 2018 (the expectation is that there will be an approval in Europe in the second quarter). The drug targets the rare conditions of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome, which are variations of epilepsy. Furthermore, there are other indications for Epidiolex, such as Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Rett Syndrome.  * 6 Stocks to Buy for This Decade's Massive Megatrend But of course, the company has other treatments.  Note that GWPH is looking to get approval in the U.S. for Sativex, which is an oromucosal spray for multiple sclerosis. It is currently available in 25 countries.   Marijuana Stocks Poised to Benefit From CBD Legalization: Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (HMLSF)If you do not want to buy individual CBD stocks, then you can consider an exchange-traded fund, such as the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (OTCMKTS:HMLSF). With this, you'll get exposure to companies like Canopy Growth, Aurora, GW Pharamceuticals, HEXO and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY).In all, there are 59 stocks in the portfolio and the net assets are about $890 million (in Canadian currency).Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-05-24,"Something really interesting has happened to Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG). And it's not just the fact that the PLUG stock price has doubled so far in 2019. More interestingly, investors actually seem to have started to trust Plug Power stock.After all, Plug Power's earnings earlier this month missed analysts' average estimates badly. And while the miss was driven in part by accounting vagaries, even aside from those, the quarter looked relatively weak.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer After 20 years on the public markets, and a wealth of disappointment, one might think the PLUG stock price would plunge on that type of news. That's doubly true, given how important 2019 is to Plug Power stock. Plug Power's management has promised positive adjusted EBITDA this year, a long-awaited (emphasis on both &quot;long&quot; and &quot;awaited&quot;) target for Plug Power. It hardly looked like Plug Power was off to a good start.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPLUG stock price did drop briefly, but it rebounded quickly. In fact, it now trades where it did before the report. Investors are giving PLUG  the benefit of the doubt, which history suggests is dangerous. Will this time finally be different? The Case Against Plug Power StockThe case against PLUG at the moment is reasonably simple: this is the ultimate &quot;show-me&quot; stock, and it hasn't shown enough. Its Q4 results were positive in one way, but incredible in another: as Bloomberg noted, the company generated positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time in 20 years.In, those two decades Plug Power stock has repeatedly disappointed investors. On a split-adjusted basis, the PLUG stock price touched $1,000 during the dot-com bubble. It hit just above $7 in 2011, and $6 in 2014. A major deal with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) caused PLUG stock price to double in 2017, but the gains were gone within 18 months.Given PLUG's history, there seems at least a significant risk that the 100%+ rise in PLUG stock price this year is another head fake. The company is targeting positive adjusted EBITDA this year,  but even its operating cash flow will likely come in negative. And while PLUG stock price might seem cheap at about $2.50, Plug Power stock isn't cheap. The stock trades at 2.5 times its  billings guidance for this year  and about two times analysts' consensus revenue estimates for next year.It is, as I wrote even when I recommended PLUG stock, the ultimate &quot;this time is different&quot; story. Given that, as the old adage goes, those are the four most dangerous words in investing. investors should be cautious at the very least. The Case for PLUGBut maybe, just maybe, this time is different. Amazon isn't the only key customer: Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are on board as well. Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh has teased additional announcements this year, and backed his predictions by personally buying Plug Power stock.A pilot test with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) means Plug Power could expand beyond forklifts. Its debt has been refinanced, and Plug Power has roughly $100 million in cash on its balance sheet.Meanwhile, PLUG has started to deliver on its promises. Marsh predicted positive adjusted EBITDA for the second half of 2018, and Plug Power did reach that goal. Its 2019 guidance was well above expectations,  helping to bring about the recent rally of Plug Power stock.And PLUG's underlying business model  has some value. There's a reason investors have been upbeat about its outlook, in various forms, for twenty years. Hydrogen fuel cells offer real promise , and the backing from Amazon and Walmart (both of whom own warrants on Plug Power stock) doesn't hurt as well.History might not be favorable for Plug Power stock, but at this point it's just that: history. A stock is based on the net present value of its future cash flow. Plug's future looks much brighter than it has in quite a while.

2019-05-28,"In a world where investors focus on the tech stocks of the future, the equities representing the products we use every day often get ignored. When many investors hear &quot;consumer staples stocks,&quot; they tend to think of names such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) or Clorox (NYSE:CLX). While those firms may make the products necessary for people's lives, they might also struggle to attract investor interest.However, investors should take a closer look at consumer staples stocks. Consumer staples is a diverse category, and some subsectors generate investor excitement. It can include consumer electronics. Additionally, the emerging marijuana and hemp sectors have also reinvigorated interest in consumer stocks.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Trust for Retirement Moreover, due to depressed price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios for many consumer staples stocks, some offer not only deep value, but also increased cash payouts. These four consumer-oriented equities provide a unique opportunity for significant cash payouts and stock-price growth:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (AAPL)Source: Apple Consumers often forget that some consumer staples stocks come with a tech focus. Such is the case with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company has long depended on the iPhone for the majority of its revenue. However, amid competition, consumers have shown less willingness to pay Apple's premium prices. Moreover, traders also worry about how the U.S.-China trade war will affect the company. As a result, AAPL stock remains in a bear market.The good news for AAPL longs is that arguably no other company is better positioned to reinvent itself than Apple. In recent months, the company has ventured into streaming media, credit cards, information, and other businesses in an attempt to return to double-digit growth. Even after investing in some of these areas, their cash hoard stood at $225.4 billion at the end of the first quarter.Moreover, their trailing P/E ratio stands at about 15.4. While profits will likely stagnate this year, analysts forecast that Apple will return to double-digit profit growth in 2020. Furthermore, holders of AAPL stock now earn an annual dividend of $3.08 per share. Though this brings the yield to only about 1.6%, investors should note that payouts have increased every year since they began in 2012.Apple stock may struggle in the near term as the company explores new revenue streams and deals with a trade war. However, once the company profits from new businesses and the U.S. and China agree on trade, AAPL stock should again resume its move higher. Greif (GEF)Source: Apple Greif (NYSE:GEF) may not serve as one of the better-known consumer staples stocks. However, its packaging plays a vital role in the industrial sector. Moreover, the company's financial metrics may make some investors want to secure some GEF stock in their portfolio.Since the beginning of 2018, concerns about a slowing economy weighed on GEF stock. Investor worries worsened with the purchase of Caraustar industries earlier year. As a result, GEF trades at a discount of more than 40% from its 52-week high.The forecasted earnings growth of only 4.2% this year may explain some of the stock's decline. Still, profits have typically increased at double-digit rates in the past. Wall Street predicts that that growth rate will return next year with a 12% increase forecasted.Moreover, this also leaves its trailing P/E ratio at just 9.7 times earnings. This compares well to other consumer staples stocks as many trade at a multiple above 20.  * 5 Large-Cap Stocks Getting Crushed in the Trade War Investors should also pay attention to the dividend. The annual payout of $1.76 per share takes the yield to around 4.75%. While that dividend does not increase every year, it has gradually moved higher over time. Between this payout and the low multiple, GEF stock holds tremendous potential as both a growth and an income play. United Breweries (CCU)Source: Shutterstock United Breweries (NYSE:CCU), known in its native Chile as Compañia Cervecerias Unidas S.A., is the number one producer of beer in Chile. United Breweries also derives a significant percentage of its revenue from Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Despite the beer-oriented name, the company also sells wine, spirits, and non-alcoholic drinks.Chile has gradually become one of Latin America's wealthiest countries. CCU stock has grown with the country. Despite this growth, CCU stock trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 10.4.Volatility may partially explain the low multiple in CCU stock. Analysts expect profits to increase by 76.9% this year. However, in 2020, they forecast an earnings decline of 26.2%. Still, they predict that growth to average 11.37% per year over the next five years. This represents a turnaround from previous years as profits had shrunk more often than not.That positive growth should also reduce the volatility of its dividend. The company will pay out $1.32 per share in dividends this year. That translates to a yield of 5.0% at current prices. Despite the yield and the improving profit picture, investors need to prepare for some fluctuation in the payout. The company paid only 36 cents per share in 2018, down from 56 cents per share in 2017.CCU stock will require stockholders to exercise patience with the ups and downs. However, for those that can handle the volatility, CCU should remain one of the consumer staples stocks that should have investors raising a glass. Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS)Nu Skin Enterprises (NYSE:NUS) utilizes multilevel marketing and social media to sell its dietary and skin-care products. It began operations in 1984 and sells its products under the Nu Skin and Pharmanex brands. Though it didn't sell outside of the U.S. until 1990, non-U.S. sales now account for about 88% of revenues.Consequently, worries about currency risk and trade in the second quarter have weighed on NUS stock, and it has struggled in recent days. The Provo, Utah-based firm spiked higher by 19% after beating on earnings and revenue in its 1Q 2019 report. However, in subsequent trading sessions, it has given most of that gain back as trade-related uncertainty returns. NUS stock trades at more than 40% below its 52-week high.However, that creates an opportunity among consumer staples stocks. Despite these worries, earnings forecasts for both this year and next have moved higher over the last 30 days. More importantly, these revisions point to double-digit earnings increases for both 2019 and 2020. This has helped to take its forward P/E ratio to around 11.7.  * 5 Retail Stocks Getting Slaughtered This Earnings Season Also, thanks to the decline in the stock, the $1.48 dividend yields almost 2.9%. Since this payout has increased every year for the past 18 years, investors can probably expect the annual payout hikes to continue. Both the high, increasing payout and the low P/E ratio position NUS stock for both growth and income once trade war-related tensions ease.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-30,"As the markets get ready to finish a volatile month, I'd like to discuss the outlook of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), the consumer-goods titan, whose shareholders have had a great year. Over the past 12 months, PG stock is up over 40%.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Although I would not bet against Procter & Gamble stock in the long-term, I do not find PG stock a compelling buy at its current prices. I expect PG to undergo volatility and possibly weakness in June. Despite the many catalysts that make the shares an important part of a diversified portfolio, the company also faces several short-term risks. Here are the most important things that investors should know about Procter & Gamble stock.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War  Procter & Gamble Has Strong BrandsMany consumer-staples companies have famous brands and robust fundamentals. I'view PG as one of the best consumer-staple names. Founded in 1837, the company is one of the largest manufacturers, distributors, and advertisers of consumer goods globally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company has five main segments:  * Beauty,  * Grooming,  * Health Care,  * Fabric & Home Care,  * Baby, Feminine & Family Care.With its extensive product portfolio, it covers all the basic needs of consumers. On a given day, the average U.S. (and global) household is likely to use many of its brands, including Tide, Bounty, Downy, Pampers, Always, Charmin, Swiffer, Head & Shoulders, Crest, and Gilette.The strength of Procter & Gamble's brands is helping it achieve broad geographic reach and the benefits of large size in this competitive industry. PG Stock Benefits From Robust EarningsPG's fiscal third-quarter results, announced on Apr. 23 ,showed that its sales growth sped up, as its organic sales increased 5%.  Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller highlighted the quarter as the &quot;third quarter in a row of very strong volume, sales, consumption and market share growth being driven by a strategy of superiority.&quot;Global annual revenue is over $66 billion and almost two dozen of its brands have annual sales of over $1 billion. Because these products have high margins, PG's return on capital employed (ROCE), a profitability ratio measuring how efficiently a company can generate profits, has been about  16%, which is viewed as healthy.The company has achieved those numbers through both organic growth and acquisitions. For example, the power of its brands enables Procter & Gamble to raise its prices without sacrificing a great deal of sales volume.Furthermore, over the past three years, Procter & Gamble has completed seven acquisitions. For example, in Dec. 2018, it finalized a $4.2 billion deal to purchase Germany-based Merck KGaA's Consumer Health business.  PG said that the deal would help it  expand its portfolio of consumer-healthcare products. The acquisition has increased PG's exposure to Asian and Latin American markets.Finally, Procter & Gamble's AA credit rating is possibly one of the best testaments of the company's fundamental strength. Procter & Gamble Stock Creates Shareholder ValueAnalysts have highlighted Procter & Gamble's improved margins, helped by cost-cutting across the company. Over the past few years, management has reshaped the company's portfolio to better serve changing consumer trends and spending habits.Dividends should play an important part in long-term investments. As a dividend aristocrat, Procter & Gamble stock is a favorite among income investors.PG's dividend yield is almost 2.9%.  Its robust free cash flow will probably enable it to further increase its dividends in coming years. The company has raised its dividend every year since 1957. Over the past decade, PG's dividend has jumped over 60%. PG Stock May Not Be Immune to the U.S.-China Trade WarsAlthough it may not be one of the first stocks most investors think of when assessing the potential impact of the U.S.-China trade wars, Procter & Gamble stock is likely to be adversely affected by increased tariffs. In 2018, PG's management reported that tariff increases would raise the cost of making many of its products.PG relies on China for many parts and materials, such as pipes, tanks, and containers, that are used to manufacture and package its brands.As tariffs rise, PG would either have to increase its prices or absorb the costs. Increasing prices could hurt its sales, while absorbing higher costs would undermine its profitability. Either way, there would likely be downward pressure on PG stock.In April, even before trade-war tensions began intensifying,  PG CEO David Taylor stressed that the company faced &quot;a challenging competitive and macroeconomic environment.&quot;  The rhetoric on tariffs won't ease the headwinds that Taylor described  or the pressure they put on PG stock price. Is the Valuation of PG Stock Becoming Stretched?Wall Street has been voicing concerns about the rich valuation of PG stock. InvestorPlace columnist Luke Lango recently analyzed why investors may want to pay close attention to various metrics which indicate that the valuation of Procter & Gamble stock has become stretched.Furthermore rising commodity costs have been impacting the entire consumer-staples sector in the past few months. For example, prices for inputs like plastic, paper, and oil have been rising. Indeed in Oct. 2018, PG blamed rising costs for  price increases it levied on many of its brands.Therefore, the owners of PG stock may want to assess the company's sales volumes when it reports its earnings in late July and October, in order to see if they are being adversely affected by the price hikes.If PG's volumes stay flat or fall, then more analysts may begin to find the current valuation levels of PG stock rather high, resulting in downgrades of PG stock. In 2018, a number of analysts downgraded Procter & Gamble stock due to rising commodity costs and price pressures that affected every segment of the company. Should Investors Buy PG Stock in June?At PG's current levels, I would not buy PG stock. Procter & Gamble stock has many long-term growth catalysts. However, PG is facing shorter-term risks  which are likely to push down PG stock price and deflate its valuation.Furthermore, as a result of the recent impressive rise of PG stock over the past year, its short-term technical indicators have become somewhat overextended. Investors who pay attention to short-term oscillators should note that Procter & Gamble stock has become &quot;overbought.&quot;So, in the next few weeks,  PG stock may be negatively impacted by profit-taking. Investors may want to wait for a better time to buy PG stock, such as when the share price is around $90.Finally, investors who are thinking of buying PG may also want to pay attention to upcoming earnings releases by PG's peers, including Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB), and Clorox (NYSE:CLX). Any weakness in their reports will likely put downward pressure on Procter & Gamble stock.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-04,"Fuel-cell specialist Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has truly captured the market's imagination. After suffering a horrific loss last year -- which is not an uncommon occurrence, by the way -- the PLUG stock price has so far skyrocketed in 2019, more than doubling since the January openerOf course, the million-dollar question is: will this last? History suggests it won't. In fact, history suggests a hearty heck no! Plug Power stock is a much older investment than some younger investors may realize. Shares nearly hit $1,500 at one point during the tech boom and bubble of the early 2000s.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsToday, PLUG stock trades for under $3. A fancy latte (two pumps, please) from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) costs more than a single-share stake in Plug Power.That's part of the reason why my InvestorPlace colleague Will Healy urged readers to stay away from Plug Power stock. Financially, the underlying organization has shown very little substance to support its technological potential. And while the latter is compelling from a techie's perspective, better options, such as Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) exist.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War That's a very reasonable take. But on the other hand, another one of my InvestorPlace colleagues, Vince Martin, proposed a possible bull case. Acknowledging the ugliness in the financials, Martin references a common criticism about Plug Power stock: the lack of meaningful catalysts.Here, Martin offers the underappreciated contrarian view: Plug Power actually does have meaningful catalysts. For one, the company secured a major deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) two years ago. Later, stalwarts Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) jumped onboard. Plug is also testing fuel-cell powered forklifts with FedEx (NYSE:FDX).That should provide confidence toward PLUG stock, right? Fundamentals Don't Align with PLUG StockIf we were talking about any other company or perhaps any other industry, I would consider jumping on the opportunity. However, I'm hesitant. A major reason why is that the fundamentals don't really align with the technicals.For instance, Martin mentioned that the Amazon deal doubled the PLUG stock price in 2017. Yet after a year and a half, those gains evaporated. During that time, PLUG made other deals which in hindsight only temporarily supported shares.Here's another example to chew on. Just recently, the fuel-cell specialist partnered with German electric-vehicle manufacturer StreetScooter. Under the terms of their agreement, StreetScooter will provide international courier DHL with 100 hydrogen fuel-cell powered trucks. Intriguingly, Plug Power will supply the engines in this deal.Unfortunately, Plug Power stock only received a temporary boost. It closed out a very modest session on Thursday and yesterday closed in the same place it was the day before the deal was announced.So what's going on? The DHL contract, along with partnerships with blue-chip companies should take shares decisively higher. But in this case, the technical sentiment is greatly outpacing fundamental realities.Let's go back to the FedEx deal. A year ago, Plug Power delivered its first fuel-cell electric van to FedEx. Since then, the courier has logged 17,500 miles using PLUG's EV engine.That seems very light. According to delivery-truck drivers, they average well over 100 miles a day. Traveling on business days throughout a one-year period, I'd expect FedEx to log significantly more than 20,000 miles.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault If I'm reading this data correctly, it appears that EVs just aren't as effective in large-scale transportation. The beauty about fossil-fueled technology is that you gas up and go. With EVs, it takes time to charge them. This practical barrier has prevented PLUG stock from taking off and sustaining that momentum. Plug Power Stock is a Gambler's PlayIndeed, the risk to the Plug Power stock price is the same as any other EV-related investment: the core market might be overrated as the technology stands now.Don't take my word for it. Instead, read the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's report on hybrid-electric delivery vans versus the conventional diesel variety. In summary, hybrid EV vans only performed marginally better than diesel trucks. Plus, in some metrics like reliability, the diesel trucks were superior.But here's the kicker: diesel trucks are relatively cheap and the current mainstream infrastructure supports them.In other words, Plug Power stock might be a transformative investment. But right now, it's too ahead of its time. The fundamentals need to catch up. But the problem is that the fundamentals might lag for a very long time.It's no wonder, then, that PLUG stock trades so wildly despite some positive headlines. As such, this is a gambler's play, and I'm just not that interested in gambling right now.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The May ISM report checked in at 56.9, up from 55.4 in April and above the average reading this year of 57.As has been noted here in recent days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index, meaning the stocks with the largest price tags command the largest weights in the benchmark and it is those names that often capture many of the headlines. However, the blue-chip index got some support Wednesday from some its mid-level members as several stocks outside the Dow's top 10 holdings were among the index's top percentage gainers today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sourcing Wednesday LeadershipCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was one of the Dow leaders today, jumping 1.56% a day after Morgan Stanley reiterated an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $55 price target on shares of the world's largest soft drink maker. Morgan Stanley is more enthusiastic about Coca-Cola than it is about rival Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:DPS).  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Coca-Cola is a member of the defensive consumer staples. Indicating that investors may not yet fully trust the two-day rebound in stocks following the market's May doldrums, two of the Dow's other marquee consumer staples names -- Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) -- joined Coca-Cola among the index's top four percentage gainers Wednesday.Shares of Walmart, the largest U.S. retail store, climbed 1.8% even after CEO Doug McMillon said at the company's investor meeting that the U.S. government needs to raise the minimum wage and that the current minimum hourly rate of $7.25 is too low.Procter & Gamble added 1.96% after the Ohio-based company said it will test environmentally friendly pod refills of Olay Regenerist Whip later this year. There was probably more to P&G's Wednesday than that announcement, with the &quot;more&quot; being investors favoring defensive names.Boeing (NYSE:BA), the largest Dow stock, gained 1.23% on reports the company is in talks with unidentified Chinese airlines to possibly deliver an order for about 100 of its wide-body 787 Dreamliners and 777X passenger jets. The deal could be worth $30 billion.Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), the Dow's tenth-largest member, gained 0.81% after Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger reiterated a &quot;market perform&quot; rating and $133 price target on the stock. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThree trading days into June, a historically rough month for stocks, and the Dow has traded higher twice. That is some of the good news. But there are some potentially concerning areas, including the ADP private payroll for May. That report showed the addition of just 27,000 private sector jobs last month, well below economists' forecast of 185,000 new jobs.&quot;The reality is job growth is slowing, notably slowing, but in the scheme of things, it's still strong,&quot; said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.As Wednesday's price action suggests, stocks can absorb one disappointing data point and climb higher, but with trade wars still raging, equity markets cannot afford a spate of lethargic economic data.As of this writing, Todd Shribed did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-05,"After years of fluctuations, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) finally broke out of its range in 2018. Procter & Gamble stock surged higher by more than 50% at its peak in a one-year period.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)This was the surge that took it out of the trading range it had maintained for six years. Still, after that move, many now wonder whether the stock will move higher or plateau.PG stock has long attracted income-oriented investors. Due to its long streak of dividend increases, PG has remained attractive to some even amid strategic pivots and competitive threats from emerging e-commerce players. However, valuations and headwinds coming from outside of the business could weigh on Procter & Gamble and the industry in general.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge  PG Stock and StabilityLong-term holders should continue to benefit from a boring, but stable stock. Profit growth remains modest but also steady. Procter & Gamble also belongs to a short list of equities called &quot;dividend aristocrats.&quot; These stocks have increased dividends annually for at least 25 years. In the case of PG stock, the streak has run for 62 years. I do not see any apparent reasons that will not continue.Further, PG remains vibrant even though its competitive moat consists of shelf space and name recognition. While consumers recognize Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers, they can choose worthy alternatives not produced by PG. Moreover, the rise of ecommerce threatens the importance of shelf space. I do not see sales falling off of a cliff, but that can present a headwind to company growth.Consequently, I see Procter & Gamble stock as a &quot;don't buy.&quot; I would add that investors who bought 13 months ago have seen the PG stock price rise by as much as 55%. That group might want to consider selling. Procter & Gamble's New FocusTraders may have finally decided they like PG's strategic moves. Procter & Gamble remained rangebound for most of the decade as it restructured. In 2012, it sold Pringles to Kellogg (NYSE:K), exiting the food business. It has also exited other product lines in subsequent years.Despite these sales, acquisitions also continue. It also bought the consumer health division of Merck (NYSE:MRK) in 2018. Effective in July, it will employ what it calls a &quot;simpler corporate structure&quot; made up of six business units.Such strategic pivots relieve worries about a weak competitive moat. They should keep Procter & Gamble stock stable. Moreover, peers such as Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) and Colgate Palmolive (NYSE:CL) trade at similar multiples, offering little advantage over PG stock. Procter & Gamble Stock Is PriceyStill, for all of the income potential Procter & Gamble stock offers, it now appears overbought. The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio at around 24.5 exceeds its long-term averages. It's also a lot to pay for a company expected to grow earnings by 5.7% this year. That estimate could fall if tariff-related issues raise input and manufacturing costs.Moreover, while the dividend yield of 2.8% stands well above S&P 500 averages, PG has historically offered higher payouts.However, investors can find lower-cost dividend aristocrats for income. Equities such as AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and AT&T (NYSE:T) offer deeper competitive moats and higher dividend yields at much lower PE ratios.I expect that the rising payouts will attract many to Procter & Gamble. However, income-oriented investors can find both higher payouts and fewer competitive threats outside of the consumer defensive names. Final Thoughts on PG stockHigh multiples may hamper the near-term growth of not only Procter & Gamble but that of consumer defensive stocks in general. Despite strategic threats, PG should remain stable and continue to generate the cash flows that will fuel dividend growth for the foreseeable future.However, new buyers will have to pay close to 25 times earnings for an equity expecting profit growth in the mid-single-digits at best. In fairness, its most direct peers face a similar situation. Also, if one must buy a consumer defensive stock right now, I would recommend PG stock.Still, income-oriented investors seeking dividend aristocrats can find lower multiples and higher payouts outside of the consumer defensive sector. Rather than buying Procter & Gamble stock at these levels, investors should seek options with more profit potential.As of this writing, Will Healy is long ABBV stock.

2019-06-10,"If you were lucky enough to buy Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) last June at its 52-week low of $73.60, today you're sitting on a 48% unrealized profit. That's an impressive haul, particularly from Procter & Gamble stock, which doesn't necessarily have a high-growth reputation.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)In fact, the PG stock price has performed so well that shares have now exceeded their all-time high of $108.68. If you're a momentum investor, PG has gained almost 9% in the last three months alone.And if you're dividend investor, Procter & Gamble stock still yields an attractive 2.8%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, if you're not a buy-and-hold investor and are sitting on profits, you might want to take them. And if you're contemplating buying because the PG stock price is on a roll, you might want to think twice. Here's why. Free Cash Flow and the DividendGood companies grow their free cash flow and dividend payments. Dividend investors look for these two things in a business. Procter & Gamble has increased its payout for 63 years, making it a Dividend Aristocrat.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy That Yield 4% or More A quick look at PG's FCF in 2018 shows that it grew 19% from $9.4 billion in 2017 to $11.2 billion this past year. That's a plus. However, if you go back five years, it's only grown by 2.6%. Meanwhile, the annual dividend payment's increased by 30% to $2.98 a share.Not surprisingly, its long-term debt over the past five years has grown by 12% from $19.1 billion in 2013 to $21.4 billion at the end of this year's third quarter. If FCF is not growing fast enough, taking on more debt becomes necessary to perform critical functions. These include dividend payments share repurchases, and other actions. How Expensive Is the PG Stock Price?Value investors like to buy stocks whose FCF yields are 8% or higher. FCF yield is defined as FCF divided by enterprise value (market capitalization plus short- and long-term debt less cash).Its current FCF yield is 4.1% (trailing-12 month FCF of $11.9 billion divided by enterprise value of $289.6 billion). Its current dividend yield is 2.8%. Together, they're 6.9%.In June 2014, PG's free cash flow was $10.1 billion. Its enterprise value was $239.6 billion for an FCF yield of 4.2%. The company's dividend yield at the end of fiscal 2014 was 3.1% for a combined total of 7.3%, 40 basis points higher than today.The big positive if you own Procter & Gamble stock today is that it does a much better job generating FCF from its earnings. In 2014, it created 86 cents of FCF from every dollar of earnings. Today, it makes 99 cents of FCF using the same framework.But the big problem with Procter & Gamble stock is that the underlying sales growth is atrocious.In the first nine months of 2019, PG grew sales by 0.52% or $261 million. Of its five reportable segments, two had decent-sized declines year over year. If not for the 4.3% growth rate from its beauty division (the company's third-largest segment), 2019 would be a write-off.On the bottom line, it's not much better. For instance, pre-tax income is up less than 1% in the first nine months of the fiscal year. If not for Trump's tax cut, its net profits wouldn't be nearly as substantial. The Bottom Line on Procter & Gamble Stock Trading at 24.1-times FCF with very little in the way of sales or earnings growth, here's the plain truth: the PG stock price is anything but cheap.However, the fact that it's doing a better job converting net income to FCF than in the past suggests it's probably fairly valued at this point or maybe a little on the expensive side.Are there better options? Probably. But who can resist the dividend?At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-20,"Shares of Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) are climbing on optimism that its deal for Acreage Holdings (OTCMKTS:ACRGF) will go through. On Wednesday the deal received CGC stock shareholder approval, just leaving regulators on the table for a potential headwind. We also have this afternoon's earnings to get through.Source: Shutterstock By and large, the deal is expected to go through, particularly given some of the board members involved. Acreage board members include former Republican Congressman and Speaker of the United States House John Boehner and Brian Mulroney, the former Conservative Prime Minister of Canada -- among others.Many expect the $3.4 billion cash and stock deal to go through, leaving Canopy with a big asset for future growth here in the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen investors think of blue-chip stocks, Canopy won't be the first that comes to mind. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and others are what investors think of, but that doesn't matter. CGC stock has quickly proven that it's the best of the best when it comes to cannabis investments. Canopy Growth Is a Blue Chip StockAfter Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested some $4 billion into the company, it loaded CGC's bank account. But the deal gave Canopy a lot more than a good reputation. Suddenly, it had a powerful balance sheet as a major asset. It could afford to enter new markets, gobble up high-growth companies and essentially lead the land-grab charge as cannabis gains momentum. Further yet, it had a high-quality and reputable company staking big-time money on Canopy's leadership. That gives the company some clout.  * Check Out These 5 Fast-Growing Stocks to Buy Today If Constellation trusts Canopy with $4+ billion, why shouldn't I? That's what a lot of investors and other companies found themselves asking.CGC stock has built a foundation in Canada and is working on global expansion in Europe and Australia, while its Acreage Holdings deal positions itself for the coming landslide in the U.S. While its valuation doesn't quite reflect its current fundamentals, investors are betting on its long-term potential.In essence, they are betting that CGC will become the PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP)  or Coca-Cola of its industry. That's not to say New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV), Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) or Cronos Group (NYSE:CRON) won't be winners either. Just that CGC is becoming the 800-lb gorilla of the group.From the most recent earnings release:&quot;Our successful first full quarter with recreational sales in Canada reinforces our long held strategy of making meaningful investments early in order to secure market share,&quot; said Bruce Linton, Chairman & Co-CEO, Canopy Growth. &quot;With a strong cash position, we added strategic assets and IP through acquisitions to accelerate the sophistication of our inputs with ebbu, and our consumer-facing outputs with Storz and Bickel.&quot; Trading CGC Stock  Click to EnlargeCGC stock is now pushing through its 20-day and 200-day moving averages. If it can continue to push higher, its 50-day moving average near $44.50 is in sight. This stock has been volatile, but continues to very slowly push out new highs.Unfortunately, those new highs are often met with a wave of selling. For instance, after hitting $52 in February, Canopy Growth stock quickly retreated, falling to sub-$42 -- a 19% drop -- in just six trading sessions. It traded sideways for a while after that, before eventually pushing up through $52. A month later, shares were at $38.38. The peak to trough decline was more than 27% that time.So what can we expect on this go around? Much of it will depend on earnings, set for after the close on June 20th.I'm looking to see if CGC stock price can again climb back to $52. If it can, it will represent a 20% rally from current levels. As we said above, Canopy stock is a blue chip name among the cannabis industry. If this group regains momentum, so too should CGC. Earnings may be the spark for that momentum, but we won't know until Friday morning.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal If the earnings results inspire investors to gobble up CGC stock, upside targets of $48 and $52 are within reach. If the reaction is negative or if the 50-day acts as resistance, I'm looking for support near $40. Below opens the door to some serious declines, but let's not get ahead of our skis. Let's see the report before going any further.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Although generally a great performer on days that are good for the broad market, traders decided shares were overextended from their outstanding performance through the first half of the year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer Headed into the first day of a trading week that will halt halfway through to celebrate Independence Day, the stock charts of KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK) hold the most interest. Here's what's most noteworthy. Mohawk Industries (MHK)Back on May 14, I pointed out Mohawk Industries shares were finding strong support at key moving average lines, which had a good chance of pushing the stock up and over a major resistance level than at $144. Although it was going to take some time and a little luck to make it happen, it was a prospect worth watching.As of Friday, MHK shares are at $147.47, above a key ceiling not for the first or second time, but a third time. And, it's this third effort that looks most built to last, as a couple of other bullish clues have materialized in the meantime.  Click to Enlarge  * The $144 area was February's peak, but as of the middle of May, that was also where the white 200-day line was. That long-term moving average line has since fallen, but either way, Mohawk shares are above it.  * The purple 50-day moving average line has also moved above the 200-day average, creating a so-called &quot;golden cross&quot; that points to a new bullish undertow that should last for a while.  * The pullback in mid-June was daunting, but all it took was a kiss of the 50-day moving average line to reverse course for higher highs again. The fact that the 50-day average is support bolsters the golden cross that took shape last month.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart it becomes clearer how much support a couple of the stock's key moving averages are now providing. Procter & Gamble (PG)One bad day doesn't quell an uptrend. But, two sizeable setbacks in four days and a complete unwillingness to participate in marketwise bullishness is highly suspect.That's Procter & Gamble right now. Friday's loss was hardly devastating, but the close was well under the open, and the volume behind the selloff was significant. The move lower also solidified a pullback effort that has been taking shape since PG stock bumped into a long-established resistance line in the middle of June. It's all part of a rising trading range, though given the length of the advance, there's good reason to be concerned the fresh weakness could be an omen of a major correction.  * 7 One-Stock Portfolios for Passive Investors   Click to Enlarge  * The prod for last week's weakness was a new encounter with a rising resistance line, plotted in white on both stock charts, that extends back to May of last year.  * We've seen this ceiling push P&G stock lower before, though, usually to no avail. A floor has been established, marked with a red dashed line on both stock charts, but the gray 100-day moving average line may also act as support if tested.  * If neither of those floors holds up in the event of a more serious wave of selling, the next-best support area is the white 200-day line, currently at $96.88 but rising quickly. KeyCorp (KEY)In early June, KeyCorp was pegged as a breakout candidate. The stock had been increasingly squeezed into the tip of a converging wedge pattern, and was running out of room. There is a major technical ceiling to clear in conjunction with the upper boundary of the wedge, but if breached, such a move could prove catalytic.That happened. Although the rally took a breather as the pivotal ceiling was met, the bulls held their ground until they could regroup. Thursday's advance cracked the ceiling, and Friday's follow-through move outright broke it. There's little left to hold the stock back here, particularly if the rest of the banking sector's stocks continue to advance.  Click to Enlarge  * The upper boundary of the wedge is marked in yellow on both stock charts, but the best bullish argument here is the move above the white 200-day moving average line.  * The thrust is healthier than it may even seem on the surface. For the better part of June, the purple 50-day and gray 100-day moving average lines served as support, turning into a pushoff point for the new rally.  * Despite headed into a weekend that many people will use as the beginning of a vacation, the amount of buying volume grew nicely into Thursday's and Friday's sessions.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-02,"Sometimes the signals get crossed, making it difficult for investors to know if a stock will head up or down. Will defective products make an incurable hit to a company’s name? Will poor quarterly earnings push a stock down, despite strong revenues? Will a troubled reputation outweigh an improving outlook?Here we take a look at three blue-chip stocks which have a mixed outlook right now. That’s down to bullish and bearish factors playing off against each other. So, what does that mean for investors? Let’s see what top analysts have to say about these three key names, and how they are reacting to conflicting signals. Boeing Company (BA)Boeing has had its troubles recently, and we’ve been here to report on them. It started back in March, when a 737 MAX 8 aircraft belonging to Ethiopian Airlines crashed just after takeoff, killing all aboard. Turns out, it was the second such accident in less than five months. It didn’t take long for airline regulators worldwide to ground the MAX 8 model until both a cause and fix were known.Boeing, to its credit, responded quickly. The company suspended deliveries of new MAX 8s, even though the plane is the most popular model of their best-selling airliner. Better yet, within a few weeks announced that they had located the cause of both accidents, a software flaw in the autopilot system, and that they were working on a fix. Boeing took a serious hit to the bottom line, but the company has other production models and was confident that it could get the MAX 8 program back on track during Q3.Fast forward to the present, the beginning of Q3. Boeing is suddenly facing a much more serious situation, with the FAA delaying certification of the software fix for the MAX 8, and worse, investing both a second problem with the 737 and an unrelated problem with the 787’s assembly facility in South Carolina.This is a perfect storm of bad news for Boeing, and the details only make it worse. Bloomberg has reported that, to cut the budget, Boeing outsourced coding work on the MAX 8 software to Indian temp workers at $9 an hour, while the Seattle Times newspaper has reported that the US Department of Justice is issuing subpoenas to the South Carolina assembly plant responsible for the wide-body 787 due to allegations of poor quality work. And to top it all off, the FAA has delayed the official testing of the new 737 MAX 8 software until July 8 or later, pushing the plane’s return to service into the fourth quarter at the earliest. With all of this, no one is surprised that BA shares are dropping in the markets this week. The stock closed down 2% on Monday, July 1, at $356, at loss of $7.55 per share. On the UpsideThe surprise comes, however, from Boeing’s resilience in the face of this steady pummeling. BA is up over 10% year-to-date, and continues to receive strong ratings from Wall Street’s analysts. Five-star analyst Myles Walton, of UBS, gives Boeing a ‘buy’ rating, based on evidence that air travel customers are willing to use 737 models. Citing a survey by UBS’ Evidence Lab, Walton says, “A single point in time survey does not capture ongoing consumer sentiment which can change relatively quickly… we did note some improvement in sentiment around consumers' willingness to fly on a 737 MAX.” Walton gives Boeing an ambitious $500 price target, indicating his confidence in the stock with a 40% upside.Delving into the complexities of the MAX 8’s recertification for service and resumption of production delivery, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu agrees that MAX 8 deliveries will not restart until Q4. She reduces her forecast for total delivery of the model in 2019 by the 126 aircraft previously expected in Q3, but maintains her belief that the company will deliver 179 planes in the calendar year’s final quarter. In line with the reduced full-year delivery expectation, she lowered her EPS estimate from $14.70 to $12.75. She keeps her ‘buy’ rating on BA, however, saying, “Boeing should be able to recover the lost deliveries once the final fix is in place.”On a final note, Boeing’s most recent analyst rating, from Kenneth Herbert of Canaccord Genuity, is a ‘hold.’ Herbert believes the delay will impact Boeing more than its supply chain companies, but even here, he sees that impact as limited, with most of the damage already done. He gives BA a price target of $380, with an upside potential of 6.6%.Overall, BA shares remain a ‘Moderate Buy’ in the analyst consensus, with an average price target of $436. This gives the stock a robust 22% upside from the current share price of $356.View BA Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Nike, Inc. (NKE)Just do it, Nike says, but should you? The popular apparel company just missed on earnings for the first time in seven years, but the stock actually gained in the aftermath, further improving on this year’s 15% gains. Stocks don’t usually gain after a decline in earnings, so what happened?On June 27, Nike reported Q4 and full year results for FY19. The Street consensus expected EPS of 66 to 67 cents, representing a year-over-year drop of 3 to 4%, but the actual result was worse. Q4 EPS came in at 62 cents, down 10% from the year-ago quarter, and well below the forecast. Quarterly revenue, however, was up 4% to $10.18 billion, and in line with the forecast of $10.20 billion. The revenue numbers included 7% growth in the core North American market, to $4.165 billion, and an impressive 16% growth in the China market to $1.70 billion.The earnings drop was mainly due to an unfavorable currency environment, with the stronger US dollar costing the company over $1.4 billion on the bottom line, according to CFO Andy Campion. Nike had planned for a stronger dollar, but political uncertainty due to US-China trade tensions and the Brexit situation impacted the currency exchanges more than they had expected.Despite the trade and tariff tensions, company execs were positively gushing on the potentialities of the Chinese market. Quoting CFO Campion again, “Let's turn to Greater China, which grew 22% on a currency neutral basis in Q4. This marks the 20th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in China.”Mark Parker, Nike’s CEO, elaborated on the company’s successes in China: “The consumer sentiment around NIKE in China has been actually quite strong. We've made a lot of effort through the years to connect with the marketplace to take insights to use to drive innovation and messaging that is really, as we said, urban for China. So, we're seeing that continue. And it's showing up in the results.” The results, of course, being the 16% revenue growth in Nike’s Greater China market. What the Analysts are SayingNike’s fundamental strength impressed the analysts more than the depressed quarterly results. Robert Drbul, of Guggenheim, stated this explicitly in his note after the earnings release: “We are impressed with the strength in the business and believe FY20 sets up well for another year of top-line outperformance/market share gains, globally, as transformational investments continue to gain traction. Fundamentally, NKE remains one the most attractively positioned names…” He gives NKE shares a price target of $100, suggesting an upside of 17%.Stifel’s Jim Duffy agreed, saying, “With a return to growth in North America and our view of the athletic category as having long-duration global secular and structural tailwinds, we see NIKE as uniquely positioned to execute to a more direct model… The call left us more optimistic on near-term trends in China, momentum with digital platforms, and long-term margin opportunities…” Duffy’s price target, $96, indicates a potential 12% upside for NKE.Nike’s shares hold a ‘Moderate Buy’ from the analyst consensus, based on 14 buys, 4 holds, and 1 sell given in the past three months. NKE is selling for $85, so the $94 average price target yields an upside potential of 10%.View NKE Price Target & Analyst Ratings Detail Procter & Gamble Company (PG)Defensive stocks are useful for protecting investment portfolios from market volatility. They tend to overperform in bear markets, but by the same token, they frequently underperform in bull conditions. Procter & Gamble is a classic example. The consumer goods giant, well-known in the self care, home health care, and baby care segments, offers products that customers need, and will pay for, no matter what the economic conditions. It’s a niche that has supported the company since 1837.The enviable niche position lies behind Goldman Sachs’ recent upgrade of PG from a ‘neutral’ rating to a solid ‘buy.’ The investment bank expects that Procter & Gamble will show higher margins and better profit growth going forward, based on 41% growth so far this year and “room for additional outperformance.” A Major UpgradeAnalyst Jason English, writing the note for Goldman Sachs, said, “This past year has marked a turn in PG’s market share and organic sales growth. We expect next year to mark a turn in its margin profile and profit growth as relative organic strength sustains… There is a role in investors’ portfolios for a large liquid global staples company such as this and note that PG remains the most underweight US listed mega-cap global CPG company…” English boosted the price target on PG by over 9%, to $125, indicating an upside potential of 13%.Goldman Sachs is not the only major bank to look favorably on PG shares. Morgan Stanley’s Dara Mohsenian last month raised his price target on this stock to $116, underlining expectations for the company’s continued strong performance.Like the stocks above, Procter & Gamble has a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split of 6 buys and 6 holds. The stock’s recent strength has pushed the share price, $110, above the average price target, $109, giving it a net downside at the moment. As the analysts above show, however, that average target is likely too low.View PG Price Target & Analyst Ratings DetailFind your own best investment with TipRanks’ data tools, such as the Analysts’ Top Stocks.

2019-07-03,"In order to give market participants a head start on Fourth of July festivities, U.S. markets had a half day today, but the shortened trading session still gave the major benchmarks enough time to post some decent pre-holiday gains.Source: Shutterstock With investors focusing on the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a concerning economic data point was overlooked. Or was it? The ADP private payroll survey, which excludes local and federal government hiring, showed the addition of 102,000 private sector jobs last month, well below expectations of 135,000.The June jobs report is due out Friday, with economists expecting the addition of 165,000 jobs. In May, the U.S. economy added a disappointing 75,000 jobs. On the other hand, if jobs numbers and other marquee data points remain sluggish, the Fed could be compelled to act and lower interest rates, which would benefit riskier assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that line of thinking in mind, the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 added 0.75% and 0.77% respectively, today while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.67%. Lots Of WinnersIn late trading, 25 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average were in the green, one of the highest numbers we've had the pleasure of revealing since we started this feature just over a month ago. None of the five losers had losses of 1% or more, and most were on the modest side. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was the Dow's worst-performing member today, losing 0.86%, but that was likely the result of some profit-taking, as the largest U.S. bank is up 5.6% over the past week.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice Finishing the day higher by 2.3%, the consumer products behemoth Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was the Dow's best performer on a percentage basis. All of the Dow's consumer staples names closed to the upside today. As for P&G, the Ohio-based company reports earnings on July 30.Sticking with staples for a moment, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the largest domestic retailer, rose 0.7% despite reports that the company's e-commerce effort is losing $1 billion. Apparently, those are the costs associated with trying to take on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the online retail space.It was a light day in terms of analyst action on Dow stocks, but Visa (NYSE:V) added almost 1% after Wedbush reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the stock.International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) gained almost 1% following reports that the stock is slated to enter a prestigious dividend index. Assuming IBM raises its dividend next year, that will mark 25 consecutive years of higher payouts, meaning the stock can enter the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a benchmark that requires members to have raised payouts for at least 25 straight years.Pharmaceuticals name Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) was one of the Dow's best names today, jumping 1.71% after Mizuho initiated coverage of the stock with a &quot;buy&quot; rating and $97 price target. The shares closed just under $87 Wednesday. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt is often said that the Fed is &quot;data dependent,&quot; a notion that could be tested as soon as Friday with the arrival of the June jobs report. Simply put, if that number is perceived to be concerning, stocks could still rally because traders will price in the Fed acting to help the economy, including with an interest rate cut.For those with bullish leanings, take heart: Barclays was out with a note indicating it is highly possible that the S&P 500 rallies another 10% from current levels.

2019-07-03,"Finally, shares of 3M (NYSE:MMM) have bounced. The 3M stock price has rallied almost 9% since late May, when MMM stock touched a three-year low.Source: Shutterstock That low was reached thanks to a hugely disappointing first-quarter earnings report in late April. Lowered guidance and a big miss led the 3M stock price down 13%; that's an absolutely huge move for a Dow Jones Industrial Average component.In fact, it was such a big decline that 3M alone took almost 200 points off the Dow. It was the biggest decline in MMM stock since the 1987 stock market crash.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIncredibly, it got worse: 3M stock kept falling. At those lows, MMM had declined 27% in less than six weeks.From that standpoint, the rally of late isn't surprising or concerning to those of us who question broader market valuations. Dividend stalwarts like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) trade near all-time highs. Income investors looking for dividends and value are looking to 3M stock for the obvious: shares are seemingly &quot;on sale&quot; and yield a still healthy 3.3%.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer But it's not necessarily a good thing to pick one stock because others are too expensive. And the bounce in 3M stock ignores the fact that the decline occurred for good reason. 3M's business isn't healthy. Longer-term headwinds remain intact.Furthermore, MMM stock -- yield or no yield -- isn't that cheap. Investors looking to jump on 3M need to remember that price and dividend yield alone don't make a buy case. The Case Against MMM StockThe argument against 3M stock at this point is reasonably simple: significant end markets are in rough shape. As 3M CFO Nicholas Gangestad noted at a recent conference, 30% of revenue comes from automotive, China, and electronics.None of those markets seems healthy at the moment. Sales in the three markets combined fell &quot;mid-single-digits&quot; in Q1, leading organic sales on the whole to decline. But this isn't a single-quarter problem. &quot;Peak auto&quot; is a long-running concern. Chinese demand is slowing, and the trade war may well impact 3M's positioning longer-term. Electronics prices continue to fall, putting pressure on manufacturers which may make its way to 3M.What's notable is that beyond those three markets, it's not as if performance was all that impressive. 3M's commentary suggests that the other roughly 70% of the business maybe grew organic sales 1% in Q1.Plus, cyclical worries could hit demand. Inventories are at high levels, as analyst Stephen Tusa -- who has been prescient about the fall of General Electric (NYSE:GE) -- has noted. Growth is stalling out at the end of the cycle. This raises the question of what will happen once that cycle inevitably turns. The Case for 3M StockIt's easy to argue with 3M that this, too, shall pass. It's a 117-year-old company: 3M has been through worse and come out on the other side. Revenue is diversified. China may well bounce back. 3M is a dividend king, with 61 consecutive years of payout increases. That logic suggests the applied-sciences giant will be just fine.Meanwhile, a 17-times forward multiple leaves the 3M stock price relatively cheap, even after the bounce. A 3.3% dividend yield means investors &quot;get paid to wait&quot; for the business to improve.But that case seems too thin, and too high-level. There are real problems in the business right now. So real, in fact, that 3M had to cut guidance three months after it was issued.As far the broader argument about 3M's history, multiple, and dividend, investors could have made the exact same argument about GE. They could have said much the same about healthcare distributor Owens & Minor (NYSE:OMI), or Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD).To be sure, I don't expect MMM stock to follow the trajectory of those names, who slashed their dividends and have fallen -- in the case of OMI -- as much as 90% in recent years. 3M's dividend may be at risk at some point, but it appears safe for now. (The company is pulling back on share repurchases, however, after its recent acquisition of medical products manufacturer Acelity.) And I'm not betting on 50%+ downside for MMM stock. Concluding ThoughtsBut this isn't a case where the market is overreacting. Neither is a nervous market taking down the 3M stock price. The market is at all-time highs, but 3M isn't.Therefore, investors aren't overreacting to some perceived external threat; 3M delivered the bad news itself. Anyone buying the dip here should keep that in mind.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-07-05,"Sometimes in investing it truly does stand to reason that you should buy what you use. And right now Disney (NYSE:DIS) is a shinning example of this. I've said it before, and it bears repeating today, there's a lot to like about Disney stock.Source: Baron Valium via FlickrAnd off the price chart, analysts at Goldman Sachs agree. According to Goldman, Disney stock is one of five &quot;superstar stocks&quot; to buy now.The other names currying favor as superstar stocks include Ford (NYSE:F), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Altria (NYSE:MO).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe firm's enthusiasm for DIS and these other companies is based on their ability to dominate their respective industries. In turn, this allows for stronger bargaining power and higher profitability. Not surprisingly, much of what's supporting Goldman's view for DIS stock comes from people like you and I who enjoy a whole lot of what Disney offers.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice From the entertainment giant's box-office breaking Avengers: Endgame release this summer, to its dominant theme park business and latest hit attraction Star Wars: Galaxy Edge, to the company's upcoming Disney+ streaming platform, there's something for everyone it seems.Still, Disney's business wherewithal and our enthusiasm to buy its products and services doesn't mean buying shares of DIS stock will necessarily be gratifying, let alone in the immediate future. But right now off and on the price chart, Disney is looking like one of those opportune times. Disney Stock Weekly Chart  Click to EnlargeIt has been a solid year for DIS stock investors. Shares are up 30% compared to the S&P 500's gains of around 18%. But there's good reason to see this friendly trend as continuing in 2019's second half.As the weekly chart in Disney reflects, after consolidating for more than three years, 2019 has literally and figuratively been a breakout year for Disney stock. If we're to believe long periods of price congestion like the one in DIS lead to outsized rewards once shares finally break free of those patterns, then shares may only be half way home.Conservatively, I'd put a price target on my optimism for DIS stock at $175. And with shares now consolidating for the past couple of weeks in a small base on either side of the April all-time-high, there's sufficient evidence Disney is about to reassert its forceful trend.For investors agreeable with our outlook, my suggestion is to buy shares above $144. That's marginally above the mid-June pattern and all-time-high.To guard against bearish risks, I'd place a stop below $137. This exit is just beneath the current low of the price consolidation. It also keeps risk smartly contained to less than 5%. And in the event we're right about Disney's price trajectory, the strategy looks like an even more compelling way to enjoy the ride.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-07-08,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders clearly expect to hear more good news when the beverage and snack giant reports its fiscal second-quarter numbers on Tuesday morning. Pepsi stock is up 9% since its most recent quarterly report. It has also rallied nearly 18% since the Q4 2018 Pepsico earnings. By consumer-staples standards, that's a monumental run up.Source: Shutterstock It's also not a terrible bet. Although the big move does present some valuation-based challenges for Pepsi stock, it's been years since Pepsico earnings have missed. Indeed, it's only failed to beat quarterly bottom-line estimates once in the past three years alone.Still, the sheer scope of the multi-month gain sets the stage for potential profit-taking. Should the Pepsico earnings report present anything less than ideal, a beat may prove irrelevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pepsico Earnings PreviewFor the most recent look, analysts collectively expect the company to report earnings of $1.50 per share of Pepsi stock. Additionally, forecasts call for sales of $16.42 billion. That bottom line would be up versus the operating profit of $1.49 per share that Pepsico booked in the comparable quarter from a year earlier. Furthermore, revenue at that level would mark a 2.1% improvement on the year-ago top line of $16.1 billion.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Adverse currency-exchange rates have been and continue to weigh results down. However, please note that rivals like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) have lamented the same headwind. During the first fiscal quarter of 2019, disadvantageous foreign exchange rates reduced Pepsico's per-share profit by 2%. 3 Things to WatchWhile a multi-faceted company, investors will only be able to respond to the most noteworthy changes in the company's business. Three items presently matter more than any other. As such, they need to be weighed carefully during and following the Q2 Pepsico earnings report.1.Organic SalesOrganic revenue is a figure that strips away the misleading impact of changes in currency-exchange rates. It also removes changes associated with business acquisitions or divestments. In other words, it is a more accurate picture of a corporation's true health and Pepsico stock specifically.For Q1, Pepsico saw organic sales growth of 5.2%. Assuming the company maintains this stride, it's a repeatable target.2.Full-Year GuidanceWith its Q1 Pepsico earnings report, PEP modeled full-year organic revenue growth of 4%. And though it also cautioned per-share profits could decline by 1% in 2019, that would be entirely due to investment being made in its growth. Perhaps more importantly, Pepsico guided for $9 billion in operating cash flow and $5 billion in free cash flow. Management is planning on giving $8 billion of that back in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.Changes to that initial outlook have the potential to move Pepsi stock, for better or worse.3.Revenue Mix Vs. Profit MixNorth America's beverage arm is the company's biggest by revenue, producing 32.2% of Q2 2018's top line. It's not Pepsico's breadwinner in terms of income though. That honor belongs to North America's Frito-Lay snack-food unit. This arm accounted for 23.8% of the year-ago revenue but contributed 39.6% of the company's total operating earnings.While it's unlikely to change much, you should look out for any variances of each unit's sales and earnings contributions. Even small fluctuations could signal trouble and potential disruption of Pepsi's low-margin business. Looking Ahead for Pepsi StockRegardless, investors mostly have to embrace that judging Pepsico stock right now isn't a simple exercise.Just a few days ago, analysts with Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted that FY2019 is an &quot;investment year.&quot; Specifically, management hopes to bolster growth through capability enhancement, manufacturing, and go-to market capacity additions. Further, advertising and marketing investments should increase consumer awareness.It's a work in progress and will be difficult to ferret out any specific impacts just yet. However, the market may respond to a qualitative feel on how this spending is setting up future growth.On the other hand, that qualitative feel for Pepsico stock may not matter at all right now.While it would be unlikely Pepsico fails to continue moving fiscally forward, that might not be enough for Pepsi stock.  Click to EnlargeOne has to zoom out to a multi-year chart of Pepsi stock to fully appreciate it. However, the rebound since May of last year has been more than dramatic. In fact, the 37% jump over this timeframe is unprecedented.It's also carried Pepsico stock back to a familiar resistance line that tags all the major price peaks going back to 2011.Now valued at a trailing price-earnings ratio near 23 and a forward-looking of 24, we've got to get real: there's little plausible room for more upside even if the beverage and snack company does everything it's expected to do. Prior to 2015, a trailing PE anywhere but the mid-teens was unusual. Therefore, you should approach Pepsico stock with caution.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-08,"(Bloomberg) -- The owner of Zest soap, VO5 shampoo and Binaca breath freshener wants its brands to be top-of-mind, but that’s hard to do when stores relegate them to the bottom shelf -- or drop them entirely.That’s the dilemma facing High Ridge Brands Co., which markets a collection of personal care products whose names have lost their former clout. Some of the brands had their heyday years ago, and it didn’t help that Walmart Inc., the nation’s biggest retailer, stopped stocking some of High Ridge’s skin and hair products in its stores, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report last year.Investors have taken notice, with High Ridge’s most junior junk-rated debt quoted at pennies on the dollar. Credit raters cite growing concern that the firm can’t keep up with its more than $500 million debt load, and a September interest payment looks particularly doubtful to S&P Global Ratings. This leaves High Ridge little time and cash to compete for attention with consumer product giants.“When you’re trapped at the bottom of the shelf, it’s a tough world out there,” said Laura Ries, half of the eponymous brand consultancy Ries & Ries in Atlanta. “Brands are incredibly valuable, but they also don’t necessarily live forever.”High Ridge was formed by Brynwood Partners LP in 2010 to acquire the rights to Zest from Procter & Gamble Co. in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. Over the years, it picked up other names like Coast, White Rain shampoo, Rave and Salon Grafix. Private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice bought the Stamford, Connecticut-based company in 2016 in a deal valued at $415 million.Clayton, Dubilier & Rice declined to comment for this article; High Ridge and Walmart didn’t respond to messages.American consumers got to know Zest soap through splashy 1980s TV commercials that boasted a wash free of soap residue -- Zestfully clean. Product development and customer tastes have changed, sparking innovations like brands that are free of preservatives or those that keep the environment in mind. Millions of Americans have stopped using Zest bar soap since 2011, data compiled by Statista show. “Mass market hair care and and mass-market cleansing have had a difficult time,” Deborah Aitken, a consumer products analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview. “The mid-end, there’s so much competition fighting for space.”New SpiceIt’s possible to revive a faltering brand, as shown by P&G’s Old Spice. The soap and fragrance brand had been relegated to the realm of old men until an aggressive advertising campaign -- recall the shimmering man on a horse, from 2010 -- helped re-position it. Such turnarounds are hard to pull off, and they’re expensive: The campaign included TV, print, social media and personalized videos, and featured supermodel Fabio.High Ridge doesn’t have the same financial heft as P&G. High Ridge doesn’t publicly report earnings, but in March 2017, Moody’s pegged annual revenue at about $370 million. At the time, S&P predicted debt would remain below 7 times Ebitda -- a key measure of profitability for debt holders. By mid-2019, the ratings firm estimated debt at more than 20 times Ebitda.Two years ago, High Ridge brought in Patricia Lopez as chief executive officer to help turn things around. Her background includes managing brands for P&G, Estee Lauder and Avon such as Aerin, Pantene, Head & Shoulders, Pampers and Gillette, High Ridge said.Getting shelf space at a store like Walmart can be a make-or-break matter for consumer goods, and the fierce competition includes costly “slotting fees” demanded by some retailers to open up space. At High Ridge, about 40% of revenue came from just two stores -- Walmart and Dollar Tree Inc. -- according to a Moody’s report from last year, which said that level of concentration limits the company’s bargaining power over shelf space relative to big competitors.A spike in the price of palm oil -- a major ingredient in soap -- also hurt the company in 2017, and the following year High Ridge began having problems with one of its major soap suppliers, according to S&P. When S&P downgraded High Ridge to CCC- in May, the ratings firm predicted a default or restructuring.Default Warning“They’re obviously struggling,” said S&P analyst Jerry Phelan. “Their liquidity is weak and we don’t think they’re going to be able to make their next interest payment.” About $11 million is due in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, followed by another payment in March 2020 and a credit line that matures in 2021.Bonds that High Ridge sold in 2017 to help buy oral care brand Dr. Fresh are quoted around 10 cents on the dollar. A first-lien term loan was quoted below 84 cents earlier this year.“A lot of these roll-ups have happened because companies are shedding these brands,” Ries said, noting that in 2014 P&G disclosed plans to sell as many as 100 brands. “Rolling up all these little tiny ones is tough.”&#92;--With assistance from Matthew Boyle.To contact the reporter on this story: Jeremy Hill in New York at jhill273@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Nicole BullockFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.","Owner of Zest Soap, VO5 Shampoo Looks to Revive Faded Brands"

2019-07-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Supply-chain finance is the secret sauce behind Citigroup Inc.’s mid-20% return on equity from transaction banking.That might sound counterintuitive, especially in Asia. The export-led region is facing the brunt of supply dislocations as the U.S.-China trade war intensifies. But the skirmish isn’t a showstopper for financing. As production moves from one country to another, transactions that need to be greased with money or credit will occur somewhere else. They won’t disappear.For evidence, take a peek at Citi’s recent quarterly results. The bank has $715 billion in deposits from institutional clients. About $166 billion of it is in Asia, up 8% from a year earlier and growing faster than consumer banking deposits. What’s more, Citi doesn’t even have to aggressively seek corporate liquidity by promising high interest rates. It just has to work with a few hundred clients – not just Western multinationals like Procter & Gamble Co., but also Asian ones such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Xiaomi Corp. – by lubricating their vast global supply chains running into tens of thousands of vendors.Imagine a detergent maker in Indonesia that gets paid by P&G 90 days after billing. The company would be tempted to accept money from Citigroup even for 120 days if doing so helps to keep its domestic bank-financing lines unencumbered. Citi doesn’t take any credit risk on this small supplier because the bank is going to be paid by P&G, which also benefits by getting an extra 30 days to settle its bills. A big chunk of the corporate cash swirling on Citi’s balance sheet is what the multinationals have in their accounts at the bank , vast sums that ensure supply chains function smoothly.In a two-part series about virtual banking – the hottest new thing in Asian finance this year – my colleague Nisha Gopalan and I concluded that corporate cash management may be a more lucrative bastion than retail for the digital warriors to storm. That’s particularly so for Wall Street banks looking beyond fickle investment-banking revenue. However, even that “more modest leap of faith,” as we described the lure of transaction banking to the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., will have trouble clearing Citi’s moat. It may not be impossible for an online-only bank to operate in more than 160 countries, deal with heavy penalties in case it flouts sanctions or gets dragged into a money-laundering scandal, and over time build its own war chest of deposits. But it’s certainly going to be difficult.None of this means that traditional transaction bankers can rest easy. In the world they’re familiar with, materials move one way; money in the opposite direction. The greater the risk of interruption to the flows, the higher the premium for ensuring they don’t. This age-old landscape is changing fast. The consumption of a Netflix movie or a Spotify song is purely digital. Deloitte estimates that by 2025, more than a third of all consumption in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia will be done by people born after 1980. The spending of digital native generations – Y and Z – will be light on materials.Transaction bankers can’t dig themselves into a hole and pretend they’re engaged in a pure business-to-business activity. If you want to bank Uber Technologies Inc., you have to grapple with the financing of the discount coupons on late Uber Eats deliveries.Many things in the new digital supply chain will be done more efficiently by non-banks. Deloitte cites the example of Traxpay, chosen this year by Edeka Group, a large German food retailer, to handle the working capital needs of its vendors. Platforms like Traxpay will still need banks. But the real profit lies in owning the client relationships, not in providing money. To retain their edge banks will either have to buy promising fintech firms, or build their own rival products. Both options are capital-intensive; neither is guaranteed to succeed.We’ve previously characterized transaction banking as humdrum to distinguish it from its flashier cousin of retail digital banking. But not only is supply-chain finance juicy for banks, its meat-and-potatoes wholesomeness is drawing in fintech and Wall Street investment banks. The $715 billion of cheap liquidity sitting on the balance sheet of the big daddy of transaction banking is both a temptation for challengers, and a dare. It’ll be interesting to see where those deposits are five years from now.&#92;--With assistance from Nisha Gopalan To contact the author of this story: Andy Mukherjee at amukherjee@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services.

2019-07-22,"There's no denying 3M (NYSE:MMM) stock is, despite all of its woes, still a dividend champ. With February's increased payout now on the books, the annual payout of 3M stock has climbed for 61 consecutive years. And, with a dividend of $5.76 per share of 3M stock scheduled for 2019, there's tons of wiggle room for 3M, since analysts, on average, are calling for full-year earnings of $9.40 per share.Source: Shutterstock But even with 3M stock price beaten down to near $173 and MMM stock yielding 3.26%, the shares aren't appealing. This company's got problems, and its China headwind may be the least of them.  * 8 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than Amazon The foremost challenge facing 3M stock may be its ultra-diversified business model itself, followed closely by waning loyalty towards its brand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Symptom of a Bigger IllnessThis coming Thursday, 3M will reveal its second-quarter results. For better or worse, the bar for its Q2 results is set low. After 3M lowered its full-year profit outlook when it released its weaker-than expected Q1 results,  analysts, on average, are only calling for Q2 income of $2.06 per share of 3M stock. The company reported EPS of $2.59 in the same quarter a year earlier.China received the lion's share of the blame for the Q1 EPS miss. Though 3M's year-over-year sales fell by higher percentages in Europe, Middle East and Africa, China is a much bigger market than they are. The Q1 revenue of 3M's Asia-Pacific unit fell 7.4% YoY.That decline, however, wasn't offset by its North American revenue., as its U.S. sales inched up a paltry 0.1%. Perhaps worse, its total organic sales volume fell somewhat dramatically.That's an indirect sign that 3M may not command the same kind of pricing power it enjoyed just a few years ago.That certainly jives with data indicating that consumers and corporations aren't as loyal to particular brands as they used to be. They don't have to be. The advent of the internet has given rise to transparency. With equivalent alternatives now readily available at lower prices, buyers of all ilks are choosing options besides 3M.More than that, though, 3M is arguably ill-equipped to restore the kind of brand loyalty that can meaningfully improve its pricing power and sales volume. Conglomerates Are BrokenThere was a time when conglomerates worked. Dissimilar organizations under the same umbrella could at least share shipping costs, while similar products could be cross-promoted. Think Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) selling detergent to the same customers who usually buy its paper towels.Once again though, the advent of the internet has largely negated that edge. Anyone can start a business and reach P&G's customers all over the world. Indeed, smaller outfits like Dollar Shave Club have capitalized on doing one thing incredibly well: utilizing clever marketing to chip away at dominant names in the business like Gillette and Schick.Noteworthy is the fact that Dollar Shave, along with similarly small startups like Harry, have been acquired by big conglomerates. Equally noteworthy is the fact that the conglomerates that acquired them have largely left them alone.That, in turn, has lead some owners of 3M stock to wonder if the company's office-supply arm would be better served by operating on its own.As for 3M's more industrial-oriented product lines, rival brands haven't been the problem as much as size and saturation. A lack of focus, however, could still be a key liability for 3M.That's certainly been the case for General Electric (NYSE:GE).For decades it successfully managed to operate businesses ranging from light bulbs to locomotives to life sciences. It could do so because the world moved slowly, and competition wasn't everywhere. With China now fully industrialized, digitalized and capitalized, though, speed matters. Saturated markets matter. The large amount of manpower needed to manage such complex enterprise now gets in the way. There's a reason GE is now selling assets. The Bottom Line on 3M StockNone of this  means that 3M can't move past its hurdles, restore pricing power and optimize its conglomerate in a way few other companies are even willing to try anymore. Anything's possible.Even before it's fully addressed its more philosophical challenges, though, it's making itself even more complicated. 3M announced in early May that it would be acquiring wound-care company Acelity for a hefty $6.7 billion as a means of ramping up the growth of its healthcare business, whose 2018 results were disappointing. But if the company can't sell what it already makes, what assurance can it offer investors that it can sell Acelity's products any more effectively?There may be a legitimate answer to the question, but if there is, it wasn't passed along to the owners of MMM stock.Meanwhile, investors may be cheering for a turnaround, but there are reasons 3M stock price continues to make lower lows. There's a lot of work, longer-term initiatives, and tough decisions that 3M needs to make at this point, but it doesn't appear the company is ready for that just yet.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Same-day shipping is becoming the norm for online shoppers but for smaller merchants it can be a logistical nightmare. That’s where Shopify Inc. can step in, says Ric Kostick, chief executive officer of 100% PURE.The natural skincare company ships up to 5,000 orders a day from its own warehouse in San Jose, California. That works fine for customers on the West Coast but it can take up to a week to get its bamboo blur powder and coconut shower gel to the rest of the U.S. The company contemplated setting up an East Coast warehouse but the prospect was technically daunting.“The hardest thing is programming the technology to route the packages the right way and route the orders based on what a customer orders and what inventory is available at each site. Shopify has built the technology to calculate this,” says Kostick, who co-founded 100% PURE in 2004. “This is something I’ve wanted for years.”When Shopify said last month that it was moving into the fulfillment business -- essentially charging online merchants to store and ship their products -- the shares spiked and analysts began talking about the Canadian upstart as a potential competitor to Amazon.com Inc.It’s unlikely to become a serious threat to Amazon at this point. But many analysts believe the Ottawa-based company’s decision to add logistics to its range of online services is smart because it could help keep customers loyal, fend off competition and create an additional source of revenue. The move also could potentially pry small merchants from Amazon, which is focusing more on mega brands like Procter & Gamble Co.“A merchant is doing tens of millions of dollars in revenue but their fulfillment is a complete mess and that could prevent them from being successful,” says Taylor Sicard, a former Shopify employee who now runs a company that helps merchants set up e-commerce businesses. “It is a massive opportunity for Shopify.”Founded in 2006, Shopify had a simple pitch: pay us $29 a month and we’ll give you all the tools required to start an online business. Many Shopify customers fail, but the more successful they are, the more money Shopify makes through transaction fees and higher-priced subscription tiers. Its Shopify Plus premium service, which counts Kylie Jenner, The New York Times and 100% PURE as its customers, can cost at least $2,000 per month.Investors love the model. Shopify shares have soared more than 1,800% since the company went public in May 2015, making it one of Canada’s most successful startups. The stock has been hitting records almost daily and now has a market value of C$48.73 billion ($37 billion), bigger than two the country’s oldest financial heavyweights, Manulife Financial Corp. and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.But Shopify has struggled to make a profit and is poised to report a net loss of $35 million on sales of $320 million for the second quarter on Aug. 1, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.As the company matures, meanwhile, it will be harder to sustain the average 74% year-over-year revenue growth rates it has managed over the past three years. There are also concerns that Shopify relies too heavily on a few, large merchants that use its premium services. Most of the company’s customers, which amounted to over 820,000 as of June, are smaller and tend to flame out on a regular basis, creating considerable churn.That’s where the fulfillment service comes in. The company has pledged to negotiate low rates with warehouses and shipping companies, then pass those savings on to its customers. In the future, Shopify could pool shipments from different merchants together, making shipping faster and cheaper and gaining some of the same advantages Amazon gets from its centralized fulfillment network.Initial PhaseIt’s partnered with logistics firms to offer the service to merchants shipping orders of 10 to 10,000 items in seven warehouses in states including Nevada, California, and Texas in the initial phase.“Right now it is really important that we invest in the right growth opportunities for the future and not necessarily take our foot off the gas,” says Harley Finkelstein, Shopify’s chief operating officer.Many merchants prefer using Shopify because they can create a brand on their own website, rather than being subsumed into an Amazon-style marketplace. The new fulfillment service will also let them slap their brand on the shipping cartons, something some fulfillment companies don’t offer.Kostick, who also sells his products on Amazon and uses its fulfillment network says the U.S. company provides access to one of the fastest-growing distribution channels for beauty products in the U.S., but Shopify offers more control.“You can customize your own website however you want,” he says. “Basically, you’re empowered.”Jennifer Harper, who also sells sustainable cosmetics through Shopify, says she will wait until Shopify sorts out any kinks before trying the fulfillment service. Others say it could be difficult and expensive to get out of existing contracts with standalone services in the short term.Happy MerchantsShopify says it could eventually build its own warehouses. While Shopify’s finance chief, Amy Shapero, has said that the company will be able to offset the cost with fees for the new service, some analysts say revenue will be limited at first because Shopify will need to offer discounts to lure merchants.Amazon may have little to fear from Canada’s most valuable tech company at this point. Still, Shopify offers a serious alternative to the Seattle leviathan.“Amazon is all about trying to satisfy the customer,” says Anurag Rana, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They do whatever they can in their power to squeeze money out of the merchants to give it to customers. Shopify is the exact opposite. They will do whatever it takes to help the merchant and maximize their profit.”(Updates with share price and market cap in seventh paragraph)To contact the reporter on this story: Simran Jagdev in Toronto at sjagdev1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jacqueline Thorpe at jthorpe23@bloomberg.net, ;Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Robin AjelloFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Shopify Nips at Amazon With Hassle-Free Shipping for Small Firms

2019-07-26,"Buoyed by some strong earnings reports from technology companies and a solid second-quarter GDP reading, stocks rallied Friday, pushing toward more all-time highs.Economic growth in the U.S., the world's largest economy, slowed to 2.1% in the April through June quarter, but that topped economists' estimates calling for growth of 2%. That was a decent number, but still the lowest pace of economic growth since President Donald Trump took office.Trump took to Twitter to encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, saying second-quarter growth would have been better if borrowing costs were lower.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Personal consumption expenditures rose 4.3%, the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2017. Government consumption expenditures and gross investment rose 5%, the fastest pace since Q2 of 2009 as the economy was coming out of the Great Recession,&quot; reports CNBC.Fueled by a big post-earnings rally in shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.11% today while the S&P 500 added 0.74%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled higher by 0.19%. Offense Through DefenseIn late trading, 18 of the Dow's 30 components were in the green with about half those names higher by close to or more than 1%.While it cannot be argued that more aggressive tech stocks powered the market higher today, several of the Dow's top performers on Friday were highly defensive names. In fact, the top four Dow stocks in terms of percentage gains would fit the bill as &quot;defensive.&quot;On light news flow, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which reported earnings earlier this week, was the Dow's top gainer today, adding 1.94%. The stock closed higher by about 4% this week. Earlier in the week, RBC analyst Nik Modi reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the stock while upping his price target by $4 to $60, implying decent upside from Friday's close.On light volume and news, consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) climbed 1.73%. PG's Friday gain could be a case of investors buying into the stock in advance of the July 30 earnings report. The company is expected to report a profit of $1.06 a share, up from 94 cents a year earlier.Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), one of the Dow's laggards this year, added 1.31% despite news that regulators are allowing T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) acquisition of Sprint (NYSE:S) to move forward. Those are the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers in the U.S. Their marriage creates a larger No. 3 behind Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). Dow Jones' Repeat OffenderAmong the Dow losers today were several names that have made repeat appearances on the offenders list.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) are among them, but the index's worst performer today was Dow (NYSE:DOW).The chemicals producer slid 3.21% after a Bank of America research note out today said the stock is &quot;stuck in neutral&quot; and that pressure on the company's profits is likely to linger into the first half of next year. Dow Jones Today: Bottom LineNext week could bring plenty of excitement with another Federal Reserve meeting on tap. The prevailing reaction to Friday's GDP report was that while the number was a modest surprise, it was not so strong as to discourage the Fed from cutting rates.On the earnings front, the week starting July 29 is another busy one with about 26% of the S&P 500 reporting. At the sector level, technology and healthcare, the S&P 500's two largest sector weights, see about 30% of their components report. That is dwarfed by the 72.15% of energy companies reporting in the week ahead.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-30,"To the surprise of no one who has paid attention to financial markets this year, stocks traded lower today. This was due in large part to President Donald Trump tweeting about the state of the U.S. trade relationship with China on the day talks between the two sides commenced in Shanghai.&quot;China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 -- was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now -- no signs that they are doing so,&quot; he said on Twitter earlier today. &quot;That is the problem with China, they just don't come through.&quot;Trump's tough talk on China did not end there. Later in the day, on his way to Virginia, Trump told the press corps, &quot;we're either going to make a great deal or we're not going to make a deal at all.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy With Over 20% Upside From Current Levels Yesterday, I warned that with the trade negotiations starting today, stocks could be beholden to Trump's comments. That was the case Tuesday as the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.24% while the S&P 500 closed lower by 0.26%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.09%. Pfizer Falls AgainOn Monday, pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) was one of the worst-performing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This following the news that the company is spinning off its generics business and that the unit will merge with Mylan (NYSE:MYL).Traders didn't like that deal on Monday and they really didn't like it today, sending Pfizer lower by 6.39% on volume that was more than triple the daily average. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley downgraded Pfizer to the equivalent of &quot;hold&quot; ratings from the equivalents of &quot;buy&quot; ratings.&quot;We ultimately believe PFE's decision to spin-off its Upjohn unit makes strategic sense,&quot; wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Jason Gerberry. &quot;However, for PFE stock to work, the RemainCo would need to trade above 18x forward multiple of EPS which we view as unlikely given current portfolio mix.&quot; Not Many Dow WinnersThe list of Dow winners today is short as just 10 of the index's 30 members were in the green in late trading. Two of those names were higher by more than 1% with top honors going to Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). With Boeing getting a lot of run in this space, I'll focus on P&G today.The consumer products giant climbed 3.82% on more than double the average daily volume after the Ohio-based company reported better-than-expected earnings. Excluding the $8 billion charge related to the old acquisition of Gillette, P&G earned $1.10 a share, slightly above the $1.05 per share Wall Street expected. Sales across all of P&G's 10 original brands increased during the quarter.Overall sales jumped 3.6% to $17.09 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, ahead of the $16.86 billion analysts expected. Shares of P&G, which yield 2.57%, hit record highs today. Dow Jones Bottom LineThe Federal Reserve meeting starts tomorrow and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports quarterly results after the close today, so there is ample event risk looming over the next 24 hours. With trade talks in China not off to the best start, at least according to President Trump, the Fed could feel some added pressure to lower interest rates in the U.S.That would not be a benefit to U.S. equities, but it could be taken as a positive sign in China, too, perhaps renewing the conciliatory aspect to the discussions. With the dollar trading at two-month highs, export-dependent U.S. companies could use the benefit of lower rates.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-01,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Shares of Procter & Gamble Co. reached an all-time high this week after the company released a blockbuster quarterly earnings report. Organic sales – a measure that strips out currency movements and other factors – were the highest in more than a decade, with each of its major divisions posting at least mid-single digit growth from a year earlier on this measure. An upbeat sales and earnings forecast for 2020 capped off the win.It’s a remarkable change in momentum for a consumer-goods behemoth that only a year ago was licking its wounds after a bruising proxy fight and was desperate to show it could do better amid tough competition from insurgent and private brands.So how did P&G do it? Many factors, including a new organizational structure and revamped marketing strategy, are playing a role. Importantly, though, it’s also done a good job of figuring out how to get shoppers to pay more for its products. It’s here that I want to focus, as there are some lessons in what P&G has done for another corner of the consumer world – the apparel industry – which badly needs to do the same thing.One way P&G has gotten consumers to splurge is through product innovation. Pampers Pure – a version of its familiar diaper that is made with plant-based and sustainable materials – has helped lift sales recently in its baby division. This product, new to the market in 2018, capitalizes on consumers’ growing preference for eco-friendly products while also giving the company a reason to charge a premium price. This year, it followed up with Pure products in its Always and Tampax brands.Higher-priced items have also been driving strong growth in its laundry division. Tide Pods and Gain Flings carry a 50% price premium compared to liquid detergent, and yet shoppers scoop them up because the format offers obvious convenience.Here’s why I think the apparel industry should pay attention to this dynamic, even though selling consumer staples is a somewhat different beast. Chains such as Gap Inc., Ann Taylor and Macy’s Inc., have become over-reliant on discounts, which can cheapen their image and hurt margins. Lately, their approaches seem to largely center on using technology to present more personalized deals, or to introduce fresh loyalty programs as a way to offer value. And it hasn’t done much to return them to relevance.What if, instead, they focused on product innovation, like P&G does, to get people to pay full price? In apparel, there are at least a couple of ways to do this.One is working to develop garments with clear functionality or performance advantages, such as a white t-shirt that isn’t see-through or pants that don’t shrink in the wash. This, in fact, is how  Lululemon Athletica Inc.  has become a rare bright spot in the clothing business. Women are willing to pay $98 for its leggings because its distinct fabrics and designs result in a comfort and durability that shoppers deem worth the price tag. No wonder the athletic apparel retailer has booming sales and practically never discounts.Product innovation could also mean fashion newness – creating pieces that people simply feel like they have to have. As Andrea Felsted and I noted in a recent column, Inditex SA’s Zara does it all the time. J. Crew Group, for all its current woes, managed to win with fashion innovation during the apex of the Mickey Drexler-Jenna Lyons era, when its sequins-as-daywear and oversize necklaces became a go-to look every chain was forced to imitate.It isn’t just product innovation, though, that has allowed P&G to win with pricing; it has also raised prices on existing items under banners such as Bounty, Charmin and Puffs as it has sought to offset elevated commodity costs. In some ways, this is a risky move, as private-label brands are there as a cheaper alternative.Here’s the thing, though: P&G is fond of saying “performance drives brand choice.” In other words, executives trust that, for all but the most budget-conscious shoppers, people are going to be loyal to the product they think works best.Clothing sellers should consider embracing this philosophy. Mid-priced apparel chains appear to be battle-scarred by two factors: the recession that ended a decade ago, and the concurrent competitive incursions from value-oriented players such as H&M operator Hennes & Mauritz AB and TJX Cos., owner of the T.J. Maxx chain. That confluence of events seemed to spook them into believing that the only thing that would ever get shoppers to open their wallets is discounts.I don’t think that’s true. In today’s upbeat economy, I am confident plenty of once-devoted Banana Republic, Loft or Express Inc. shoppers would pony up for work attire they perceived to be durable, or for a date-night dress they thought was a knockout. The mental calculus wouldn’t be so different from why that same woman springs for Charmin even when the generic toilet paper is right next to it on the shelf: It performs better, so it’s worth the cost.Mall-based clothing chains are in a rut. It’s high time for some more creative thinking – and perhaps some unusual inspiration – if they’re going to dig out of it.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-08-01,"Walmart (NYSE:WMT) will report earnings on Aug. 15 before the market opens. When WMT stock has strong technical momentum, it tends to do quite well on a pre-earnings run into the report. For Walmart stock, that puts the trade in play this week, even though the company's quarterly results won't hit the tape until mid-August.Source: Shutterstock What's so nice about playing pre-earnings trades? First, we use options so our risk is completely defined. Second, this trade has a high rate of success.Working even more in Walmart's favor is the fact that the company has been doing incredibly well as of late. Shares are up 20% so far on the year. That's about in-line with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY). Also, it's almost 400 basis points higher than the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSEARCA:DIA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Best Stocks to Invest in for August Over the past year, WMT stock is up more than 26%. This has more than tripled both the SPY and DIA performance over that time. Trading Walmart StockThe Walmart stock price has been holding up near the $112 level for more than a week now. Admittedly, shares are below the 20-day moving average now. However, consolidating a modest pullback from the highs is attractive at this point.  Click to EnlargeWalmart is among a group of retailers that are actually doing quite well right now and holding off Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). A few of the others include Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Target (NYSE:TGT). As a result, these names have become buy-on-dips candidates. And a dip is exactly what we have in the Walmart stock price.Shares are holding over the backside of prior channel resistance (blue line). Should WMT stock fall below this mark, the next reasonable mark of support is the 50-day moving average. On a larger correction, Walmart stock should find support on a test of the $103 to $104 area.Not only was this area a big breakout zone from the last few quarters, but the 38.2% retracement for the one-year range comes into play at $104.14. Pre-Earnings Play in WMT StockLet me first start by saying that only traders comfortable with options should be using these tools as a means for trading and investing. I like to use call options in this case because I can leverage a very small amount of my portfolio (less than 1%) and look for outsized gains should it pan out.That said, those that are comfortable can consider a two-week run up to the company's report on Aug. 15. By definition, that means opening the trade today.The parameters for the trade, found using Trade Machine, also include using options that expire as close to 30 days as possible, with a delta between 40 and 50. The parameters also constitute that the trade will not be initiated unless WMT stock is above its 50-day moving average. We will use a 40% stop-loss and a 40% gain as our exit on the trade. (The software calculates both the entry and the exit at the market close).When these parameters are all satisfied, this trade has been successful three out of four times (75%) in the past year. Over the past two years, this trade has been successful six out of seven times (85.7%). And over the past three years, the trade has been a winner seven out of nine times (77.8%).Of course, past performance does not guarantee future returns. But by leveraging options on a small amount of portfolio capital, we are simply playing the odds. Just because the odds are in our favor does not mean we will win. But it's certainly better than throwing darts. Final Thoughts on WalmartWalmart stock is one of retail's anointed names. That's probably because the company is one of the few that has the money and logistics to adapt to the industry's e-commerce and omni-channel changes. It lacks the growth of TGT, HD, COST and certainly AMZN, but it will be around for decades to come.Analysts expect just 2.4% revenue growth this year but call for an acceleration to 3.3% growth next year. On the earnings front, they expect a 1.6% decline this year, but 4.6% growth in 2020 (fiscal 2021).Last quarter, the company printed a strong 3.4% comp-store sales number. While growth isn't robust for WMT stock right now, the consumer is doing quite well. The recent GDP report highlighted strong consumer spending, offsetting the lack of business investment in the economy.The earnings reports and management commentary from Visa (NYSE:V), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) all underscore a stronger consumer too.That should bode well for Walmart stock, at least in sentiment ahead of the numbers.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-08-05,"Investors hoping for a quick resolution to the latest turn in the trade war better buckle up. A quick scan of news headlines across the net reveals a bull market in words like escalation, retaliation and currency war. Today we'll offer three safe stocks to buy for traders wondering where to hide and where to escape the turmoil.Source: Shutterstock You don't have to be an expert in U.S.-Chinese relations to realize recent developments mean pain for investors. All it takes is one look at stocks this morning. The sea of red reveals all you need to know about how investors feel regarding the battle moving into the currency markets.In case you missed it, the Chinese yuan fell to its lowest level in over a decade. The move is viewed as China's retaliation to last week's latest round of tariff increases announced by President Trump.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever Here are three strong trending stocks that should hold firm amid the tumult. Hershey (HSY)Source: ThinkorSwim Nothing says safety like chocolate bars. Hershey (NYSE:HSY) has already had a banner year. Its year-to-date gains jumped to 44% after last month's earnings release. Since then, we've seen HSY stock form a high base pattern showing little giveback or desire by shareholders to take profits. That also means it held firm in the face of the Federal Reserve meeting and the initial tariff news.This morning's behavior is perhaps the most telling. With the broad market down north of 1.50%, HSY is unchanged. Safe stock? You better believe it. I'm sure the 2% dividend yield doesn't hurt either.The consistency of its trend has also been telling. Its 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages have trended higher all-year long and show the domination of buyers across all time frames.A break below $139 would warrant reassessment, but until then, consider HSY one of the top safe stocks to buy. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: ThinkorSwim Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) hasn't kept up with the pace of HSY, but the consistency of its uptrend has been admirable. Last week's earnings announcement launched PG stock to a new record, pushing its year-to-date gains to 32%. The retracement we've since seen has been orderly and is returning PG to its breakout zone.Traders unwilling to chase the earnings gap now have a lower-risk entry point. On the cash flow front, Proctor & Gamble offers a yield of 2.8%. Its beefy payout has helped boost demand due to falling interest rates elsewhere.  * 7 Big Dividend Stocks to Consider In a Low-Rate World As long as PG remains above $110, it's game on for bullish plays. Starbucks (SBUX)Source: ThinkorSwim Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) rounds out today's trio of safe stocks to buy with a robust uptrend of its own. It has been a market-leading and market-beating stock all year long. Last month's earnings beat and stock pop placed an exclamation point on its dominance.SBUX stock has been weighed down slightly by market weakness in recent days, but the drop appears nothing more than a garden-variety pullback on its chart. We haven't even filled the earnings gap yet. Couple that with the rising 20-day moving average looming closely and SBUX looks like one of the best buy-the-dip candidates on the board.A break below $89 would cause me to re-assess, but until then, this is a safe stock to buy.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-07,"After opening lower in dramatic fashion, stocks steadily recouped those losses and grind higher in Wednesday's latter stages, providing short-term traders with the intraday volatility that they crave.Wednesday's action was very much a repeat of what investors have been dealing with in recent weeks: the trade war and speculation of another Federal Reserve rate cut prompted by, well, the trade war. Globally-inclined investors were treated to three rate cuts outside the U.S. today as India, New Zealand and Thailand joined the party.While yields on 30-year Treasuries hit record lows, helping U.S. stocks close well off the lows of the day. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 added 0.38% and 0.08%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.09%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOil tumbled today as the Energy Information Administration said domestic crude inventories surprisingly rose by 2.39 billion barrels last week, putting Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) among the blue-chip indexes losers for the day. Wednesday is just one day, but it is another sign of mounting pressure on traditional energy stocks.As I noted yesterday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is usually a weak performer immediately following its earnings reports. The entertainment giant unfortunately obliged today, sliding 4.92% to rank as the worst-performing Dow stock.The company earned $1.35 a share in its fiscal third quarter, 22% below analyst estimates. It was expected that this report would be messy for Disney. Sell-side analysts were out in force today supporting the stock, so this may be the pullback in Disney shares investors have been waiting for.Now, let's look at some winners. Quick Victory LapAdmittedly, the stock is down 5% over the past month, but The Travelers (NYSE:TRV), a name I've previously mentioned in this space, was one of the better-performing Dow stocks today, adding about 1%. Why bring up shares of Travelers today? Easy answer: the company generates little-to-no revenue outside the U.S. Yield PlayOn a light news day, shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) jumped 1.74%, making the stock today's top performer in the Dow. Bullishness in shares of the world's largest soft drink maker today could be simply a symptom. The stock has it and 10-year Treasuries don't have much of it. Earlier today, 10-year yields traded as low as 1.63%, well below Coca-Cola's dividend yield of 3.06%.I'm inclined to add Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) here because the stock rose 1.10% today. With a dividend yield of 2.61%, P&G isn't a high yielder, but is a storied dividend grower. That 2.61% is nearly 100 basis points better than what you'll get on 10-year Treasuries. Bad News Is Good NewsBig changes are afoot in the retail space and one of the cornerstones of that change is store closings. Such closures are not good news for the employees and the communities that depend on those locations, but Wall Street typically likes the news.Hence, Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) jumped 2% today after announcing it will shutter 200 U.S. stores. That move is expected to save the company $1.5 billion by 2022. Dow Jones Bottom LineThanks to the trade war, risk appetite is hibernating. Just look at the stocks mentioned above as Dow winners today. All defensive names.What else is working? Gold, which is defensive. Silver because gold is soaring, though the white metal is more volatile. And how about this fun fact: the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT), one of the least risky ETFs out there, is on a nine-day winning streak.

2019-08-08,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It was hard to imagine things getting worse for Kraft Heinz Co. than they did back in February, when the company dropped a cavalcade of bad news: It took a massive writedown, slashed its dividend and revealed an SEC subpoena related to an accounting investigation, all on top of reporting that profitability in the quarter had fallen short of expectations.That moment felt like it had to be rock bottom for a company that had been trying to cost-cut its way to earnings growth, per the typical playbook of one of its biggest shareholders, private equity firm 3G Capital. But Kraft Heinz’s latest results, released Thursday morning, made it clear the worst isn’t over. Kraft Heinz said organic sales fell 1.5% from a year earlier for the six months ended June 29, reflecting declines on this measure (which excludes the effects of currency fluctuations and M&A) in the U.S., its largest market. Cost inflation in everything from packaging to logistics, as well as promotional expenses, weighed on profit. Operating income declined 54.6% from a year earlier to $1.3 billion. Even more worrisome, the company also said it was pulling its full-year earnings and sales guidance, a move that suggests a real uncertainty about the company’s path to growth. That rightly spooked investors, who sent Kraft Heinz shares to all-time lows in morning trading. It all made for a not-so-warm welcome from Wall Street for new CEO Miguel Patricio, who was appointed in April, started in the role in July, and appeared on the company’s investor conference call for the first time Thursday. But he also didn’t help himself as much as he could have during the call, because he didn’t offer a particularly clear and specific vision for a turnaround. When an analyst asked about potentially selling off weak brands, he said that question “is not on the table” right now. I can see how that wasn’t a reassuring answer for investors, who see obvious benefits in unloading troubled assets.When asked about how he was going to improve top-line growth and boost sales, Patricio mentioned Hispanic consumers as an example of a demographic group Kraft Heinz wasn’t doing a great job of courting. He also spoke about a need to revamp its marketing. But again, this was broad-brush strokes, not details.I realize a fully formed comeback plan may be a tall order for an executive who has only been in the job 40 days. But when the turnaround effort at hand is going to be as heavy a lift as this one, I understand why investors weren’t comforted by a general outline.That said, there were a few positives in some of Patricio’s Thursday remarks. In particular, I was heartened by his answer when an analyst asked him about how his previous experience as an executive at beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev (another 3G holding) would shape his approach at Kraft Heinz.He mentioned AB InBev’s success at using “premiumization” – or making more upscale products that would appeal to craft beer devotees – to increase sales. He noted that in the packaged food industry, premiumization has largely been driven by upstarts. He’s right about that, and I agree it’s a major opportunity for Kraft Heinz. I wrote just last week about how Procter & Gamble Co., another consumer-goods giant, has returned to health in part by focusing on more high-end products that warrant higher price tags. I think Kraft Heinz could reap similar benefits if it pursued a similar approach.After Thursday’s results, Patricio’s turnaround task looks as hard as ever, and there is no time to waste. He said shareholders would see the results of a full strategic review by early next year. Too bad a bunch of investors decided not to stick around and wait for it.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Halzack at shalzack@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-08-14,"It was a wicked Wednesday as stocks tumbled amid mounting concerns that some major global economies, including the U.S., are flirting with recessions. Adding to the recession concerns, there was another instance of yield curve inversion today.For those not familiar with the vernacular, yield curve inversion is an instance of 10-year Treasury yields dipping below those on 2-year notes. This has happened several times this year. Over the course of history, such inversions have proven to be reliable harbingers of looming economic contraction.Speaking of contracting, that's exactly what Germany's economy, the Eurozone's largest, is doing which adds to risk-off pall cast over global equity markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul &quot;Germany's economy shrank 0.1 percent from April through June and has been treading water for the last year, the government's official statistics agency said. Analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted that the economy will shrink during the current quarter as well, meeting the technical definition of a recession,&quot; reports The New York Times.Here in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.02% while the S&P 500 sank nearly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.05%.In the category of &quot;what a difference a day makes,&quot; yesterday I had the privilege of saying that all 30 Dow stocks traded higher. Today, I'm sad to report that in late trading, all 30 Dow components were in the red. Dow Winners In Short SupplyToday was one of those days when it's more about highlighting the best of the worst Dow stocks, not the biggest winners, because there weren't any winners to speak of. In late trading, just five Dow members were sporting losses of less than 1%.One of those names was Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The nation's largest retailer reports earnings tomorrow and in what could prove to be some much-needed good news, analysts are speculating that if Walmart beats, it could boost guidance.&quot;E-commerce sales performance in the U.S. will be closely watched. Telsey Advisory estimates a 37% year-over-year gain, which would match the first-quarter growth. Bank of America is looking for a 35% advance, and Tesley predicts a rise of at least 30%,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;In addition, analysts may have lingering questions around tariffs, even as the Trump administration said Tuesday it will delay until mid-December the 10% tariff on some Chinese products.&quot;I recently explored the long-term potential of Walmart's e-commerce efforts here. Consumer Staples Hold UpAs for the other members of today's least-bad group, a couple of those were consumer staples names, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Given the risk-off tenor to the day, it wasn't surprising to see these stocks hold up, relatively speaking.However, there may another force at play. Historical data suggest that after yield curve inversion, the best-performing sectors are utilities and consumer staples. However, those historical anecdotes are not always all-encompassing. Just look at Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), shares of which slid 5.01% today. Dow Warning SignsCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports earnings after the bell today, but some investors departed the name in advance of that report as highlighted by the stock's 4% tumble today. Laboring around the $50-$51 area, this report is critical for Cisco's near-term fortunes. A move to the mid-$40s seems almost as likely as jump to the mid-$50s.There is also growing sentiment that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the Dow's best stock in August and one of the index's top performers this year, could be ready to decline, but that seems to be a technical bet, not a commentary on the stock's underlying fundamentals. DJIA Bottom LineI cannot confirm that a recession is imminent and it should be noted that the yield curve inversion, while reliable, is not 100% accurate. Nor am I glossing over the weakness in stocks, but historical data also confirm that the third quarter (August in particular) is usually unkind to equities.Perhaps the best strategy for the rest of this month and into September is to keep some cash on the sidelines and wait for more attractive opportunities to come available, particularly if the best defensive sectors can do is decline less than their high beta counterparts.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-20,"[Editor's note: &quot;10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever&quot; was previously published in April 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]By the age of 30, you should already have nearly a decade's worth of retirement savings under your belt. If you don't, you're not alone. A recent GoBankingRates survey showed that nearly half of the millennials questioned had no retirement savings at all.If you fall into that camp, keep in mind the old saying &quot;better late than never,&quot; because it absolutely applies if you're only just starting to build a nest egg. If you just hit the big 3-0 and you've already been saving and investing for years, bravo; however, 30 is a great milestone to look over your investments and rebalance your portfolio with some of the best long-term stocks out there. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnlike in your 20s, risk is a much larger consideration a decade later. The market is bound to go up and down, and you have to assess whether or not you could handle a market-wide pullback. Moreover, you will want to keep some powder dry to buy on a dip. Income stocks that pay dividends become important stocks to buy at this stage, but choosing some riskier players shouldn't be completely off the table.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential Of course, investors in their 30s should be holding some of their money in an index fund that will provide conservative growth. But here's a look at ten of the best long-term stocks to buy if you're in your 30s: Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy: Disney (DIS)I recommended Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock when the company's share price dipped below $100 following a racist tweet from Roseanne Barr, the star of one of the company's most successful sitcoms back in 2018. Disney responded by immediately canceling the show and distancing itself from Barr's hateful outburst, but investors worried that the loss of advertising from the canceled show would hurt advertising income.Since then, the market has come to its senses and DIS stock is back to trading above $135 per share.There are a few reasons Disney is one of the best long-term stocks to buy if you're building a portfolio in your 30s. The first is that the company is ripe for a major comeback.Disney is a solid company with a great deal of cash behind it. That means that even in the worst-case scenario, the firm has the money to spend on building out a streaming service from scratch and weather any storms that loom over the media space in the future. The firm also pays a respectable 1.3% dividend yield that will help balance out concerns about growth due to the firm's size. Netflix (NFLX)Another player in the streaming space worth considering one of the best long-term stocks to buy is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).If you missed the boat on NFLX back in 2015 when shares were trading below $50, it might be a hard pill to swallow, but NFLX is still an excellent long-term bet despite the fact that its share price is over $300 today.The reason is that Netflix still has a long growth runway before investors should start to worry about the company becoming too large to produce the kind of growth they've become accustomed to. A company like, say, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a market cap of nearly $900 billion, making it unlikely that the firm can continue to grow at the same clip over the next decade. Netflix's market cap of $150 billion leaves plenty of space for the firm to catch up to its fellow FAANG peers over the next decade.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential NFLX has the growth potential to do so as well. The company has proven that it has a good grasp on the population's ever-changing tastes, and although it has been expensive, Netflix's original content has been a huge draw for subscribers. While the U.S. market has been saturated, NFLX has only just begun its international expansion, leaving a long growth runway for the next few years.Over the past two years, Netflix has been preparing for a major push overseas, and those efforts are due to pay off over the next decade. GHB Insights' head of technology research Daniel Ives said he sees Netflix international expansion opening a potential market of 700 million subscribers in the next 2 years.So, although the streaming space is certainly getting more crowded, NFLX appears to have created a winning formula that makes it one of the best long-term stocks to buy and hold on to.  Procter & Gamble (PG)Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is one such stock to buy that, although boring, is a buy-and-hold-until-you-retire kind of stock.As I mentioned above, risk assessment is a huge part of building your portfolio in your 30s, and although you still have plenty of time to let risky bets play out, you should be thinking about adding some low-risk, solid stocks to your portfolio that will keep ticking along as the years go by.What makes PG stock one of the best long-term stocks to buy is that the company's management has a long history of maintaining a healthy cashflow and delivering shareholder returns and its 2.90% dividend yield will provide a reliable income.Not only that but PG's widely diversified business offers investors some security in times of economic trouble. Plus, PG sells a wide variety of necessities like toothpaste and soap, which are unlikely to take much of a hit even in the case of a recession.Increased competition is definitely something to keep in mind when considering PG, but the firm's strong financial position means it has the leeway to refocus its strategy and continue thriving in difficult conditions.  Exxon Mobil (XOM)If you haven't started wading back into oil and gas stocks yet, now's your chance. And Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is one of the best long-term stocks to buy for a few reasons.Now that oil prices are starting to recover, it's worth revisiting the industry. The crash in crude oil prices helped weed out weaker firms and those that survived are coming back stronger than ever with more efficient operations and better future prospects. However, worries about oversupply are still in the forefront of investors mind, which has kept the sector from becoming too expensive.First, XOM's share price is still well below its 2015 highs, giving it plenty of room for a turnaround in the coming years. XOM stock is also working on an aggressive new strategy that includes a $2 billion pipeline in the Permian Basin. The firm also sees potential opportunities in Guyana and Brazil which are expected to help XOM ramp up production significantly over the next few years.Of course, oil prices will play a major role in whether or not XOM's plans are successful, but what's nice about owning Exxon shares is the fact that the company's integrated structure means it's not a direct oil play. So, although that means XOM won't see the same kinds of gains some of its peers do if oil prices spike, that also means it won't suffer the same losses  should the opposite occur.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential XOM also pays out a 5.1% dividend that has been raised every year for the past 36, taking the edge off some of the risk. Walmart (WMT)Discount superstore Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is often overlooked by investors because Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) tends to be their first choice. While I don't disagree that Amazon is still one of the best long-term stocks to buy, worries about WMT's future are largely overdone.Since being scathed by the ecommerce takeover a few years ago, WMT stock has made an impressive recovery and although the firm is still facing some headwinds, it's a solid stock to buy.Judging by the company's improving e-commerce sales, it looks like Walmart is on the right track to competing against the likes of Amazon.  Amazon (AMZN)You'd have to be living under a rock to not have heard all the buzz surrounding Amazon over the past few years. If you haven't jumped on the AMZN stock bandwagon yet, though, there might still be time. Of course, you'd be much better off if you'd bought Amazon stock in 2012 when it was trading at just $200 per share, but the company still is one of the best long-term stocks to buy today.It might seem counterintuitive to consider AMZN when you look at the firm's massive $895 billion market cap and the fact that the company pays absolutely no dividends. Not to mention, AMZN stock has proven to be extremely volatile. However in your 30s you've still got time, and that means there's space in your portfolio for a little bit of wiggle room if you're comfortable with it.Aside from its dominance in e-commerce, Amazon is also a top dog in cloud computing, an industry destined to grow exponentially over the next few years. On top of that, AMZN is spreading its wings in a wide variety of industries including grocery and logistics and there are even rumors that the firm is working to make its way into the healthcare space as well.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential It's hard to imagine AMZN's market cap getting much larger, but 30-somethings would be remiss not to consider Amazon stock to juice up their gains over the next five or 10 years.  Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)It would be impossible to talk about the best long-term stocks without including Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B), run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. Of course, if you're 30 and just picking up Berkshire Hathaway stock now, then you're about to miss the boat in terms of benefiting from Buffett's infamous investing sense. However, that doesn't make BRK.B a bad long-term pick. The company has new fund managers at the helm who've already started taking over some of the firm's investment decisions and you can't argue with the value the firm already possesses. Berkshire has a roundup of defensive stocks that will help the firm ride out troubled markets, but the firm will also keep up with upward market trends. If nothing else, Berkshire stock is a great stabilizer that will round out your portfolio and mitigate against major market events making it one of the best long-term stocks 30-something crowd. Unilever (UN)Another consumer products stock to add to your list of the best long-term stocks is Unilever (NYSE:UN). The company has become massively efficient after undergoing major cost-cutting initiatives over the past few years in order to better compete as the industry became more and more competitive.That bodes well for the future because it means the company will be well prepared in the event of a recession, not to mention that the company sells a wide variety of basic necessities, which tend to continue selling even when purse strings are tight.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential Another reason UN makes for a good stock to buy is the firm's presence in emerging markets. In 2017, more than half of the company's reported sales came from emerging markets. The company's huge footprint within emerging markets sets it apart from its peers because it creates a great long-term growth runway that others don't have access to.  Microsoft (MSFT)Another steady-stock to buy in your 30s is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Like a few others on this list, MSFT stock isn't exactly the most exciting stock, but it will do its job and make you some money. Unlike others in the IT industry, MSTF is mature which, in this case, translates to stability rather than falling out of touch with what consumers want. Right now MSFT is working to pivot away from its traditional software business and focusing on growth in its cloud business, which includes subscriptions like Office 365 as well as Azure, Microsoft's answer to Amazon Web Services. Growth in that arm of MSFT's business has been strong. With a P/E of 27 and a dividend yield of just 1.33%, there's no doubting that MSFT is an expensive stock, but you're paying a premium for a well run, solid business that has and will continue to withstand the test of time.  Waste Management (WM)It's all well and good to invest in the next hot tech trend or retail story, but if you really want to make a play on future trends then look no further than Waste Management (NYSE:WM), the company that handles everyone's garbage. One thing is for certain, over the next few decades people are going to generate waste, and WM will be there to dispose of it. That makes it one of the best long-term stocks to buy.Not only does WM have a wide moat because of the regulatory permits it holds and its huge network of landfills, but the firm has also diversified its business to offer more than just waste collection and landfill maintenance. Waste Management also handles recycling and has been developing a way to turn landfill gas into energy. That means that as greener living continues to gain traction, WM will benefit as well.  * 5 Stocks to Buy With High-Margin Recurring Revenue However, perhaps the most alluring reason to add WM stock to your portfolio is the firm's 1.7% dividend yield. The company has been raising its dividend annually for the past 15 years and there's no reason to expect that to stop anytime soon.As of this writing, Laura Hoy was long AMZN, AAPL, UN and NFLX.

Revenue came up short of expectations and guidance was less than thrilling as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHolding the market back was General Electric (NYSE:GE), down 1.4% as investors continue to grapple with recent accusations that its balance sheet under-reflected its true risks.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul As for names worth a closer, trading-oriented look headed into Tuesday's session, check out the stock charts of Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Here's what's most noteworthy. Twitter (TWTR)It has been incredibly erratic action, but progressive action nonetheless. That is, Twitter shares are being guided upward, squeezed toward the narrowing tip of an ascending wedge pattern. More recently, TWTR stock has been finding support at levels that suggest the buyers are working on forcing a breakout.That won't be easy, particularly given how overbought Twitter shares are since the bottom made in early 2017. But, the pattern that has taken shape thus far isn't atypical of initial public offerings. Every one has to fall apart sooner than later, but most everyone eventually shrugs it off and works its way into a bullish mode.  *   Click to EnlargeThe bigger-picture in only evident through the long-term lens of the weekly chart, framed by light blue lines. The upper boundary of that pattern currently rests at $44.70.  * Zooming into the daily chart another wedge becomes evident. Framed by red dashed lines, a rising trading range has materialized. There's still room for wide swings though.  * Since May, the gray 100-day moving average line and the purple 50-day line have both stepped up as technical support.  * Although it's not ideal, the weekly chart also suggests a pretty good cup-and-handle pattern. The brimline, of course, is the ceiling that connects all the major peaks going back to mid-2014. Lowe's (LOW)Lowe's shares haven't made a straight line to their current price since finding a bottom in 2009. In fact, there has been nothing straight about LOW stock for years. But, a well-established bullish trend line has kept the overarching advance intact. The up/down action, in fact, has been oddly reliable for years.Something has changed just within the past few weeks, however, that could finally snap the winning streak. On the other hand, that would require one final but significant technical floor to buckle. The stock could reach that inflection point sometime as early as this week.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential   *   Click to EnlargeIt's evident on both stock charts, but more perspective is seen on the weekly chart. That is, Lowe's shares brushed a long-standing floor last week, marked in yellow and tried to push up and off of it.  * Although that has been where LOW stock has bounced every pullback thus far, in July, shares made their first lower high in years. That happened the first time after Lowe's shares failed to move above a major peak. That's the horizontal ceiling around $118, marked in blue on both stock charts.  * It's subtle, but telling that each MACD peak and subsequent crossunder since the beginning of 2018 has been lower than the last. That points to fading bullish efforts. Procter & Gamble (PG)At the beginning of 2018, most investors had doubts about Procter & Gamble. Although relatively new, David Taylor was capable, but it appeared the company might be beyond anybody's help.The tide turned in a convincing way by the middle of last year though, resulting in a rebound effort that has been tightly defined by a narrow trading range. Although overbought and ripe for a pullback, until it's clear the lower boundary of that range is no longer holding up, the advance has to be respected. That's especially true given the circumstances that have taken shape of late.  *   Click to EnlargeThe rising trading range is marked with a yellow line on top and a red line on the bottom of both stock charts. It has poked above the ceiling a couple of times, and bumped it yesterday.  * The weekly chart offers some needed perspective, but it also shows us something fairly new. That is, the RSI indicator is now deep into overbought territory, thanks to an unusually persistent advance.  * Although the 70% gain since mid-2018 leaves P&G shares vulnerable to a pullback, that doesn't inherently mean one will materialize. Notice that the weekly bullish volume bars are, for the most part, on the rise.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-21,"A recession isn't guaranteed. With each passing day, however, an economic downturn becomes increasingly likely. At the very least, we should expect some broader correction in the markets due to timing issues. After all, we're on a record-breaking bull run. That alone should help adjust how we approach which stocks to buy.Moreover, evidence exists all around us that we'll incur a recession. Obviously, the biggest factor here is the U.S.-China trade war. President Donald Trump has aggressively prosecuted his economic rivalry with China, but his efforts have yielded almost nothing fruitful. And while he has succeeded in damaging the world's second-biggest economy, domestic stability is starting to fracture.This might lead to both sides inking a deal, thereby rendering moot the demand for recession-proof stocks to buy. However, the trade war may have accelerated certain vulnerabilities past the tipping point. More significantly, the trade war has impacted other nations including Germany. Due to uncertainties over the U.K. leaving the European Union, export-dependent Germany risks falling into a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential And if that happens, it will send a ripple effect throughout the world. Therefore, it doesn't hurt to be prepared. Here are 10 recession-proof stocks to buy: Waste Management (WM)Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com This is perhaps the ultimate irony. In an article about recession-proof stocks to buy, I'm here talking about Waste Management (NYSE:WM). Although seemingly an illogical idea, it's actually not. You see, Americans produce a massive amount of waste, or roughly 230 million tons of it every year. Right there you have a legitimate bullish argument for WM stock.Due to the almost inhuman rate at which we throw junk away, landfills throughout the country have been nearing capacity. To help remedy this situation, we've been exporting our recyclables to China. We've mixed our trash with our recyclables, but Chinese workers have sifted through the junk to find recyclable items. However, trade war tensions destroyed this relationship, which might be a benefit to WM stock.Why? With China and other countries rejecting our trash, land earmarked for waste will jump to a premium. And I don't think it's any surprise that WM stock is one of the strongest-performing recession-proof stocks to buy. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I couldn't think of a more boring name than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Known everywhere for their household goods, the company specializes in such compelling products like diapers, detergent and over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medicine. But if you want to protect yourself with recession-proof stocks to buy, boring is usually best.The markets fully agree with this basic assessment. On a year-to-date basis, PG stock has gained over 33%. Moreover, shares have charted a very clean and consistently rising trend channel. This has been accentuated only by brief moments of volatility. Plus, shares have recovered well from the 800-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in mid-August.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill But will PG stock continue to trek higher? If we head toward a recession, this is one of the few names that will give you confidence. That's because practically everything that Procter & Gamble sells is a necessity, whether we have a downturn or not. Home Depot (HD)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com In discussions about recession-proof stocks to buy, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) comes up often. I believe that's the case because HD stock has both bullish and bearish catalysts.When things are going well, Home Depot benefits from more construction activity. During downturns, its revenue streams are somewhat insulated because repairs and renovations don't wait for recessions. And since other sectors are doing poorly in bear markets, HD stock wins over defensive-minded investors.Unsurprisingly, Home Depot shares have performed well this year, gaining about 30%. However, HD stock has offered up a turbulent ride toward those returns, worrying some onlookers.That said, the company received some good news. Due to the repercussions of the U.S.-China trade war, Home Depot's suppliers are shifting manufacturing from China to other countries like Taiwan or Vietnam. That translates to a significant mitigation of the trade war impact, bolstering the argument for HD stock. Dollar General (DG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com I've said this before, but the best recession-proof stocks to buy have the most straightforward and logical arguments. Under this context, you should definitely consider adding Dollar General (NYSE:DG) to your portfolio.Simply put, DG stock is a direct play on consumer behaviors during an economic downturn. What do most people do when job opportunities run dry? They buckle in for a long financial winter. For many folks, that translates into doing whatever is necessary to save money, including shopping at dollar-only stores.Another factor benefiting DG stock is that such stores offer comprehensively great deals. For instance, I once picked up a can opener for a buck. To this day, this cheap can opener has never failed me, whereas a $12 variant from a big-box retailer might not last a year.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip Overall, I think this is the reason why DG stock is up nearly 30% YTD. During this period of extended saber-rattling and worrisome economic metrics, Dollar General has become incredibly relevant. Kroger (KR)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Over the years, I haven't shown much love toward grocers like Kroger (NYSE:KR). A big reason why is competition. Not only do you have disruptive organizations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) encroaching into the arena, big-box retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) offer one-stop-shop solutions, which include groceries. Thus, KR stock has a steep uphill climb to navigate.Furthermore, I have been right on my hesitancy toward KR stock. However, with Wall Street now shifting their focus to recession-proof stocks to buy, Kroger suddenly looks much more interesting. Of course, some serious risks abound. For instance, shares are down 15% YTD. This is also a company within an industry that depends on high volume to compensate for the low margins.However, KR stock has an advantage during downturns. As a strictly grocery specialist, Kroger can offer lower prices due to bulk shipments. Furthermore, Amazon's disruptive acquisition, Whole Foods Market, probably won't do so well in a recession. Thus, don't overlook KR in your search for recession-proof stocks to buy. Ross Stores (ROST)Source: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.com If you're like me, you probably don't care too much about fashion trends: you just buy whatever looks best on you. And for that reason, I love off-season discount retailers like Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST). I get to buy brand-name shoes and apparel, simply because they weren't popular enough or they're a few months old. Millions feel the same way, which supports the case for ROST stock during bull markets.But even in bear markets, ROST stock is compelling. That's because recessions don't happen like a light switch. A decline in GDP doesn't immediately evoke images of a dystopian nightmare. Instead, people do normal things, but with a more cost-conscious mindset. Logically, this environment benefits ROST stock.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall The markets have agreed with this assessment. Currently, ROST stock is up over 29% YTD. Moreover, shares have so far handled the August volatility well, moving up slightly for the month. Therefore, this is another name to keep on your list of recession-proof stocks to buy. Kirkland Lake Gold (KL)Recession-proof stocks to buy don't always have to be so boring and predictable, as Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL) proves. As you might deduce from the name, KL stock is a precious metals mining investment. And I really love gold and silver in this particular market setup.Primarily, I say this because the Federal Reserve is essentially greenlighting gold and silver prices to jump to all-time records. How? In late July, the Fed announced that they will cut benchmark interest rates, a first since 2008. Later, the yield curve inverted, which basically forces the central bank to cut rates further to flatten the curve.Generally speaking, these actions are inflationary for the U.S. dollar. And that is good for gold and silver prices, which in turn benefits KL stock.Another factor bolstering shares is the political stability of their projects. Largely doing business in Canada and Australia, these two nations have stable infrastructures and are allied with the U.S. With precious metals moving higher, KL stock just seems like a no-brainer. AMC Entertainment (AMC)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Unfortunately, cineplex operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) hasn't panned out as I had hoped. Of course, the critics would blast me for even thinking about AMC stock. In a world where streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dominates the content-entertainment ecosystem, AMC seems anachronistic, like a time-traveling DeLorean.A major reason why AMC stock hasn't performed to speculators' expectations is this year's movie offerings. In my opinion, it's a very slow season for Hollywood. Furthermore, it won't get better until Disney (NYSE:DIS) releases its highly anticipated &quot;Star Wars&quot; film.But as a speculative play among recession-proof stocks to buy, I like my chances with AMC stock. No matter what, humans are social creatures. Therefore, no amount of streaming will change our hardwired psychology to interact with others.  * The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy Right Now Plus, AMC represents (relatively) cheap entertainment. Even with buying outrageously priced popcorn and drinks, you're still better off at the box office than at a typical NFL game. And during a downturn, that pricing advantage is a huge tailwind. RCI Hospitality (RICK)If you're looking for viable recession-proof stocks to buy, RCI Hospitality (NASDAQ:RICK) isn't an equity that you would put on your portfolio. Instead, you would recommend RICK stock to your &quot;friend,&quot; who utilizes the company's services frequently. In fact, your &quot;friend&quot; probably has a problem receiving too much hospitality.Joking aside, RICK stock is one of the most interesting and controversial recession-proof stocks to buy. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, several gentlemen's clubs reported that business was booming. Psychologically and practically, I understand why. Men need an outlet after suffering humiliation at work. On the other hand, some women are willing to provide acrobatic hospitality when opportunities run dry.Of course, this is a really shady way of profiting from a possible downturn. However, if you're truly agnostic about your portfolio, RICK stock offers a pathway to survive and thrive. Anheuser Busch Inbev (BUD)Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com I must admit that I don't feel too terrible about suggesting RICK as one of the better recession-proof stocks to buy. Ultimately, I see this activity as consenting adults doing adult things.However, I feel almost shameful about discussing Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD). It's not because of their underlying product. Few things are as American as having a cold one at a backyard barbeque. Instead, it's the reason behind it: BUD stock may outperform your expectations during a recession.Why is that? According to health-related studies, an economic recession correlates with increased imbibing. That's not a surprise. After all, who hasn't knocked back a few to take the edge off a stressful situation?But the question is, should you profit from this narrative? If you feel that this is also a case of adults being adults, check out BUD stock. Bud Light is the top-selling beer in America. And due to its price point, it's very attractive during a recessionary period.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold and silver bullion, and AMC stock.

2019-08-22,"Although most investors consider the venerable Dow Jones as the benchmark index, in reality, folks should instead consider names like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). After all, an investment toward Alphabet stock gives you wide-ranging exposure to the most relevant and lucrative sectors.Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Unfortunately, being relevant doesn't necessarily protect you from a broader market downturn. Since the U.S.-China trade war has ratcheted up several notches in intensity, equities have not offered much stability. That goes for the GOOGL stock price, along with the market values of the internet giant's peers.Of course, it's now very tempting to go discount shopping on big tech firms. For instance, Alphabet stock has shed more than 4% since gapping up on July 26. During this same period, rivals AMZN and FB have lost 6% and 8%, respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis gamble might pay off for the speculator. But if your investing style leans more to the conservative end of the spectrum, there's nothing wrong with waiting. Yes, the GOOGL stock price below $1,200 is enticing. Based on the longer-term chart, shares really want to bust through the $1,300 level decisively.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks to Ride High on the Farm Bill However, we could have a very ugly recession threat on our hands. Primarily, President Donald Trump may be losing control of the situation. Recently, he declared himself the &quot;Chosen One&quot; as he defended his aggressive stance on China. To me, this is the sound of panicking and bodes poorly for Alphabet stock in the interim.That's because history shows us - like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act - that wrong high-level choices have severe consequences. Therefore, you don't want to go crazy on GOOGL stock. The Risky, but Fundamentally Sound Case for Alphabet StockBut should you avoid GOOGL stock indefinitely?I'm going to be upfront. If you want both a defensive position and to stay in equities, I'd go for the boring companies: Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). These are companies that have consistent demand. In my opinion, they're too boring to disrupt, giving them an Amazon moat.However, if you can handle some risk, I'd buy Alphabet stock on the next big dip. Why? Ultimately, the tech giant is a play on everything relevant.Principally, most analysts focus on the dominant presence that Alphabet levers in the U.S. digital-ad space. Together with Facebook, the fearsome duo takes home about 60% market share. Obviously, this is a compelling reason to consider Alphabet, especially if the GOOGL stock price tanks. Equity losses won't immediately translate to a loss in ad dominance.While competitors like Amazon are butting into the arena, GOOGL has a very sizable lead. And this synergizes well with Alphabet's supremacy in the search engine space.Let's zoom out to a wider angle. Even if we suffer a recession, we won't suddenly transition to a &quot;Mad Max&quot;-like society. Instead, people will do normal things, like look for a job. For such a purpose, Google (and Facebook) will see a lift in traffic, helping Alphabet stock move higher.Also, businesses desperate to gain traction will likely advertise through Google. Again, just because we're in a recession doesn't mean our behaviors will incur a paradigm shift. In this digitized economy, traditional advertising channels have become obsolete. Thus, if you want to do anything, you must do so digitally. It's unfair perhaps, but it's also a driving force for Alphabet stock. Multi-faceted Tech Business Supports GOOGL StockIf the digital-ad presence wasn't enough of a convincing reason, then investors should zoom out even wider.Whether or not you agree with the Trump administration's stance on China, the Asian power has compromised U.S. interests. In his world view, President Trump must hold China accountable for their actions.But underlining the events that led up to the trade war is China's desire to dominate world affairs. Their government even has a name for it: &quot;Made in China 2025.&quot; And it's not just the second-biggest economy that's tired of American geopolitical hegemony. In recent years, Russia's actions harken back to the Soviet Union era.What does this have to do with Alphabet stock? The tech firm attained leadership in many of the categories for which our adversaries wish to dominate, such as artificial intelligence. Right now, U.S. government agencies are taking a close look at big tech's anti-competitive behaviors.But that prosecution will probably fade into the background if we have a recession, especially one related to an adversary. Instead, an economic downturn could translate to a rallying cry for GOOGL stock.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-22,"Wall Street is sliding lower on Thursday, weighed down by word that United States manufacturing activity fell into contractionary territory for the first time in nearly 10 years. A recession certainly seems like a growing possibility as the U.S.-China trade spat bites hard alongside the delayed response of all those Federal Reserve interest rates hikes of recent years.Adding to the pressure was a disappointed reaction to yesterday's release of the latest Federal Reserve meeting minutes, which revealed that policy makers are quite skeptical about the need for further interest rate hikes at this juncture. This stands in sharp contrast to the market's expectations for the start of an aggressive rate cut campaign.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential With all the crosscurrents, investors would do well to focus their attention on the more defensive names in the market.

Watch for a rise to the upper end of the post-March trading range near $390, which would be worth a gain of roughly 10% from here.

Analysts at MKM Partners recently initiated coverage with a buy rating and a $250 price target.The company will next report results Oct. 22 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.21 per share on revenues of $5.5 billion. When the company last reported July 26, earnings of $2.05 matched estimates on a 0.2% decline in revenues. Procter & Gamble (PG)Shares of consumer staples icon Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are also enjoying a smooth and steady rise alongside its 50-day moving average.

2019-08-27,"Since March, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) has been on a steady decline, going from $10 to $5.65. But of course, ACB stock is not an outlier. The cannabis sector has been in a bearish trend, as seen with Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY).Source: ElRoi / Shutterstock.com There are a variety of factors for this. First of all, while the legalization of marijuana in Canada has been a strong catalyst, the expectations were too exuberant. So a fall-off was a much-needed adjustment.But there are other nagging issues. For example, the Canadian market continues to have supply chain problems as well as adverse impacts from black market activities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOK then, so what now? Well, timing a trade in the cannabis sector is difficult. This is why it's a good idea to average into positions. I also think it's advisable to focus on high-quality companies. And for the most part, ACB stock is a solid choice right now.Here's a look at three reasons: Growth StoryWhile there are legitimate issues with the cannabis market right now, the long-term prospects still look promising. For example, a research report from the United Nations estimates that there are about 180 million people who consume cannabis.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects But this is likely to grow, especially as more and more countries pursue legalization. Another key is that cannabis has been shown to have strong therapeutic qualities.Now there are many forecasts of the market. But they all point to strong growth. Just look at a recent report from Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics, which pegs the compound annual growth rate at 26.7% between 2017 to 2022.The Cannabidiol (CBD) opportunity also looks promising (this is the compound of hemp that does not produce a high). In the US, the Farm bill took this off the illegal substance list, and this should spur growth. BDS Analytics forecasts that the spending will hit $20 billion by 2024, for a compound annual growth rate of 49%. Strong PlatformLong-term success in the cannabis industry will likely be due to scale. This will help a company rise above the noise in the market but also deal with inevitable shifts in supply-and-demand.As for Aurora Cannabis, it is building the right kind of platform that should be a winner. The company is already a major producer in the Canadian market and is also making inroads in other countries, such as Italy. Keep in mind that it has been at the forefront of automation of facilities, which will lead to overall lower costs.Aurora Cannabis is also investing heavily in its medical business. Note that the pipeline has 40 in-process and completed clinical trials and case studies. In the meantime, the patient base has continued to increase, hitting 77,136 in the latest quarter.And yes, Aurora Cannabis has been focused on the CBD opportunity. To this end, the company has struck a variety of acquisitions, including HempCo, ICC Labs, Agropro and Borela. Nelson Peltz and ACB StockUnlike CGC and CRON, Aurora Cannabis does not have a major strategic investor. But this could change soon. The reason? In March, the company retained Nelson Peltz as a strategic advisor.He is one of the world's top activist investors, with positions in a myriad of consumers companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN). Given his extensive network, he should be able to find the right partner.But of course, Peltz should also help with other matters, such as advice on marketing and strategy. All in all, his involvement is a major validation of ACB stock.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli.

2019-08-28,"To understand how much respect Home Depot (NYSE:HD) gets from the market, just look at the price of Home Depot stock. The stock gained last week; in fact, it touched an all-time high before a recent, modest pullback.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Those gains came after the company missed Wall Street revenue estimates and lowered its full-year same-store sales guidance.In this market, that combination for any stock -- let alone one with macro and tariff concerns -- would have sent investors fleeing for the exits. Instead, the HD stock price actually rose more than 4% after the earnings release.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere's a case that, at this point, Home Depot has earned the benefit of the doubt. It's a great American retailer, with a likely $110 billion in sales this year. Home Depot stock has been one of the best stocks in the entire market. Valuation concerns in the past -- and I've raised them as recently as April -- have proven to be short-sighted.That said, investors are giving Home Depot an awful lot of credit. In fact, they're treating HD stock like a defensive play, not a cyclical one. That seems risky in this environment, and suggests that maybe this time, the HD stock price finally has gone too far. Home Depot Stock Rises on a Guidance CutTo be sure, Home Depot's Q2 report wasn't a disaster by any means. Earnings beat consensus by 9 cents. Same-store sales still increased 3%, including a 3.1% print in the U.S. The consolidated 3% gain was just 0.2 points below analyst estimates.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 and Beyond And the general take on the quarter seems to be, as one analyst put it, that it &quot;was no worse than feared&quot;. Even with modest signs of a housing slowdown (particularly in new construction) and potential impacts from the U.S.-China trade war, Home Depot is still growing sales and keeping operating margins basically flat. The lower revenue outlook is coming in part from deflationary prices in lumber (although tariffs are a factor as well).That said, the HD stock price doesn't seem to incorporate &quot;no worse than feared&quot;. A 20x+ multiple to updated fiscal 2020 (ending January) guidance doesn't sound that high. But this is a cyclical stock -- one whose sales and profits will plunge in a recession.Even that aside, the lower guidance is a concern. In late 2017, Home Depot gave a three-year target for comp growth of 4.5-6% -- it's missing that mark. Margins are nearing the low end of the company's target range. Earnings-per-share rose less than 4% year-over-year: pre-tax income actually declined.Investors are clearly betting on a stronger second half. But the issue here is that Home Depot can't drive that improvement all on its own. The Concerns About the HD Stock PriceAfter all, Home Depot needs help. It needs the economy to hold up. In many places elsewhere in the market, investors hardly seem confident on that front.Admittedly, the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (BATS:ITB), my pick for the Best ETF of 2019, has gained 33% so far this year. But those gains have come simply from regaining some of its lost ground.ITB is up only 5% over the past year and still sits ~13% below January 2018 highs. And it's not like Home Depot stock -- a major component of that ETF -- hasn't joined in on the 2019 fun. It has risen 27% despite better performance heading into this year.Meanwhile, other macro-sensitive stocks -- think Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) or automotive stocks -- have struggled and/or seen big sell-offs amid tariff and trade war worries. Home Depot's U.S. focus gives it exposure to the still-strong U.S. economy, admittedly, but on the whole investors still see at least some kind of downturn coming in the next few years.That's one big risk. The other is competition. Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is trying to execute a turnaround and it's having some success. Its stock soared after earnings. Its same-store sales have outpaced those of Home Depot for the last two quarters. Home Depot isn't losing its crown any time soon, to be sure, but a combination of a weaker market and lower market share -- even if both impacts are modest -- is not priced in at 20x+ FY20 EPS. A Cyclical Treated Like a DefensiveAnd yet the HD stock price keeps marching higher. What's interesting about the trading -- particularly this year -- is that Home Depot stock really hasn't been rattled much by outside forces. It posted some big declines in 2018, but the biggest dip so far this year came from late April through late May, when the stock dropped about 9%.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week That's a surprise given the fact that the market as a whole has, at times, been seized by selling amid tariff concerns or an inverted yield curve. A cyclical play like HD stock theoretically should be vulnerable to those swings, but it simply hasn't had much in the way of downside.Instead, Home Depot stock has traded more like a defensive stock. Its chart looks much more like that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or a Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Those stocks aren't immune to macro worries, but they're generally considered &quot;safer&quot; plays for investors worried about overall growth.It certainly seems like, particularly after last week's earnings, the market is treating Home Depot stock the same way. But that would be a mistake. If a recession hits, Home Depot sales will fall. And so will the HD stock price. Investors ignore outside worries -- and guidance cuts -- at their peril.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-29,"The U.S. stock market continues to hit turbulence. Whether due to concerns over the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, increasing media attention on a possible U.S. recession or other economic challenges, it behooves you to make sure that your portfolio is set up to deal with risk while still generating growth and income.The U.S. economy remains a haven as much of the rest of the major economies of the world are slowing or are headed into recession. Meanwhile, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remains firmly in the positive -- with expectations for full year 2019 GDP to be a positive 2.50%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, inflation remains down and low in the U.S. The Federal Reserve Bank's preferred gauge of inflation, the core Personal Consumer Expenditure Index (PCE), is running at a scant 1.60% down -- from January's high of 1.77%. In addition, inflation outside the U.S. continues to be low -- to the consternation of central banks.The underpinnings of the U.S. economy remain positive with consumers very much engaged and comfortable to keep spending. This is evidenced by the broad weekly survey results by Bloomberg in its Consumer Comfort Index, which remains up significantly over the trailing year at a current level of 61.50.But none of that is stopping traders from sending stocks gyrating up and down. Volatility spiked dramatically over the month of August.This has resulted in the S&P 500 Index being down 4.68% from recent highs in late July of this year.Meanwhile, U.S. bond yields continue to decline -- sending some to suggest that this is representative of a signal of a possible U.S. recession. But instead, as a former bond trader and bond investment manager, I argue that there are substantial reasons for lower yields and higher bond prices. Inflation, as noted above, is low and falling -- aiding bond prices. And issuance in the bond market outside of U.S. Treasuries is not keeping up with demand -- particularly in corporate bonds and municipal bonds.In addition, outside the U.S., bond yields for government and corporate issues continues to head deeper into negative territory. This means that bond investors are effectively paying to own bonds. And the market amount of negatively yielding bonds has just reached a new high of just shy of $17 trillion.This makes the US bond market all the more attractive with the still positive yields in Treasuries as well as corporate and municipal bonds. Total Amount of Negative Yielding Bonds Where to Go for Income and GrowthThere are specific segments of the markets which continue to deliver during downturns in the general S&P 500 Index. Each of these segments is exclusively or predominantly focused on the U.S. economy and markets, and each has a proven history of sustained and well-defended dividend flows.And thanks to the vast and seemingly ever-expanding ETF market, there are specific ETFs with successful tracking of the leading defensive segments. And in particular, Vanguard has a great series of ETFs with lower expense costs as well as ample liquidity in the market. REIT ETFs to BuyOne of the best defensive segments remains the real estate investment trust (REIT) market. REITs continue to fare well during both good and challenging times. The underlying security of real assets which in turn generate ample income to fuel dividend distributions remains a compelling case for investors. And thanks to the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017, REITs dividends come with a 20% tax-deduction, making the REIT yields even more attractive.And over the past five years, REITs have returned 55.75% -- for an average annual equivalent return of 9.26% as tracked by the Bloomberg U.S. REITs Index.Vanguard has its Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEARCA:VNQ) which has performed mostly in line with the REIT market index with the ETF actually outpacing the Index year to date with a return of 24.72%. Best ETFs to Buy From the Utilities SectorNext is the U.S. Utilities market sector. Utilities continue to benefit from lower inflation and interest rates, which reduces their funding costs while also making their dividend yields all the more valuable for investors. And since most utility dividends are qualified -- the income tax liability is lower for most investors' tax-brackets.Utilities are U.S.-focused and also come with the benefit of regulated rates and profit margins for their general regulated operations. This provides certainty for both good and challenging economic times. And with the U.S. economy remaining in growth mode, demand for many essential services -- especially electric power -- is on the ascent in the U.S.In addition, many utilities also run extra non-regulated wholesale businesses ranging from wholesale power distribution and/or transmission or natural gas sales and transmission. This adds to the revenues for dividends as well as fueling additional growth.Over the past five years, U.S. utilities, as tracked by the S&P 500 Utilities Index, have returned 72.94% for an average annual equivalent return of 11.58%.Vanguard has an excellent ETF in this market with its Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU). It has kept up and even bettered the market Index over the past five years. And year to date it has returned 18.92%. ETFs to Buy From the Consumer SectorThen one of the traditional defensive market segments is the consumer staples market. This is because traditionally, during good and bad economic times  consumers and households overall continue spend on the necessities for life. That concept got severely challenged in 2018 as many traditional leaders in this market ran into a buzz saw of changing consumer tastes for packaged and branded goods and costs including transportation rose squeezing margins.But while many are still challenged to focus on the right products and brands along with cost controls - others have dragged their feet with the market punishing them. That said, the segment has many successful turnarounds including Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) and even General Mills (NYSE:GIS).The market segment overall is up 54.23% over past five years for an average annual equivalent return of 9.05% as tracked by the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index.Vanguard has a well-run ETF in this segment with its Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC). It has largely kept up with the Index. And for the year to date, the ETF has generated a return of 19.06%. And like for the utility stocks, most consumer goods stocks are tax-advantaged with qualified dividends. Investing in U.S. BondsU.S. Bonds, as noted above, continue to deliver positive yields with rising prices. And with the Fed on track to its money easing policies, including its target rate range for Fed Funds and its bond portfolio activities -- the market should be further supported.There are two segments of the U.S. bond market which you should focus upon. First is the corporate bond market. Yields are down with the rising credibility of issuers (who benefit from the supportive U.S. economy). And with less issuance and strong demand inside and from outside the U.S. -- the market is faring well.The U.S. corporate bond market, as tracked by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index, has generated a return over the past five years of 25.07%. And for the year to date, the Index has done even better with a return of 14.11%.Vanguard has an excellent ETF in the corporate bond market with its Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:VCIT). It has fewer longer-term bonds synthetically represented in the ETF which has limited its performance year to date to 13.37%. But this also means that it is less susceptible to yield gyrations going forward.Then, I come to a favorite market of mine in bonds -- municipals. Municipal bonds are benefiting from a series of developments. First, U.S. bond yields overall, including Treasuries, are down. Second, the U.S. economy is doing well -- which bolsters tax revenues which in turn is reducing the need for issuance. This, along with better demand from outside the U.S., means rising bond prices. And third, the TCJA limited state and local tax deductions (SALT). This means that investors, particularly in higher taxed states, are ever more eager for more tax-free income.The U.S. municipal bond market has seen a return year to date of 20.81% as tracked by the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index. Vanguard has an excellent municipal bond ETF with its Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond Index ETF (NYSEARCA:VTEB). It has fairly matched the Bloomberg Barclays Index with a year-to-date return of 16.79%.And since I've presented my way to invest in a collection of all-weather ETFs, perhaps you might like to see more of my market research and recommendations for further safer growth and bigger reliable income.

2019-08-30,"Fridays leading into holiday weekends, particularly the Friday prior to Labor Day, usually don't generate much excitement on Wall Street and if there is, it's usually a bad sign. So with that in mind, today's results were nothing to be concerned about.Source: ymgerman / Shutterstock.com In fact, the results for this Friday, the last trading day of August, weren't too shabby when considering there was a concerning consumer data point released earlier today. Regular readers know that I've been beating the consumer drum quite a bit recently and it is a story worth following for investors.&quot;The University of Michigan's final sentiment index fell to 89.8 in August from a previously reported 92.1 and 98.4 in July,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;The gauge of current conditions dropped to the lowest since October 2016, while the expectations index matched January as the weakest since that same period.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Even with that the Nasdaq Composite finished lower by 0.13% while the S&P 500 eked out a gain of 0.06%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day up 0.16%. In late trading, just over half of the Dow's 30 components were trading higher. Dow Winners With AsterisksToday's Dow Jones Industrial Average winners were not large in percentage terms, but two of the standouts merit caution and not just because they are defensive names. Plenty Dow stocks with defensive leanings have been solid performers for the bulk of this year, but UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) isn't a member of that group.The healthcare benefits giant gained 1.35% today, good for the best performance among Dow stocks, but the shares still finished August with a loss of more than 1.44%. The best-case scenario is that traders were doing some nibbling at UNH shares today in anticipation of a possible rally over the last four months of the year, but my prescription for caution here stems from a looming democratic debate in September, which could stir more Medicare For All talk. That's always a drag on UNH.Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) jumped 1.57% today, but this is another example of a dog Dow stock with fleas. Despite today's gain, this Dow stock also finished August with a loss of more than 7%.Two other Dow stocks that were winners today, each closing higher by about 1% that I'd be careful with are Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dow (NYSE:DOW). These are both tariff-sensitive names that notched double-digit declines this month. Maybe trade talks will progress, providing catalysts for these type of cyclical stocks, but in absence of those headlines, investors considering Dow stocks of this nature are likely making no more than technical bets over the near-term. Defensive DeparturesAs I noted above, there were some bounces in defensive Dow stocks today while some similar names saw departures. Namely, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) were two of the blue chip index's worst-performing names today, each shedding more than 1%.Speculation here, but today's action in those stocks may have been nothing more than some profit taking because McDonald's and P&G posted an average August gain of 3.66%. Given September's reputation for being a rough month for stocks, it would not be surprising to see those Dow stocks do a little better next month. Dow Bottom LineWith all the talk about trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates, investors should not take their eyes off the earnings ball. Unfortunately, the news isn't so hot to this point in the the third quarter.&quot;During the first two months of the third quarter, analysts lowered earnings estimates for companies in the S&P 500 for the quarter,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;The Q3 bottom-up EPS estimate (which is an aggregation of the median EPS estimates of all the companies in the index for the third quarter) dropped by 3.0% (to $41.64 from $42.90) during this period.&quot;On another note, investors looking for sector-level ideas for September may want to consider financial services and utilities, which on a historical basis, are the best-performing groups in the ninth month of the year.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Wall Street was a very conservative place politically when I started working in the capital markets in 1999, but it seems to have lurched to the left lately. It’s not only that many of the people who work there have become more liberal, but more importantly, left-leaning behavior by publicly traded companies is being rewarded by the stock market.The decision by the Business Roundtable, which is an organization led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, to explicitly state that the purpose of a publicly traded company is social responsibility and not creating value for shareholders is just the latest example of this lurch to the left. For decades, most public companies have chosen to remain politically neutral. That remained the case even after the Citizens United Supreme Court decision on campaign finance in 2010 that held that the free speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political communications by corporations. Most expected the Citizens United decision to result in conservative political speech, but it has been quite the opposite. Ben and Jerry’s, a unit of Unilever Plc, recently launched a flavor of ice cream designed specifically to support Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign.Nike Inc.’s shares are up about 36% since the start of 2018, compared with 9.20% for the S&P 500 Index, despite backlash from some conservative outlets for signing controversial former National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick to a marketing deal and then bowing to pressure from the left and pulling its special edition sneakers featuring the “Betsy Ross Flag” that some feel was a symbol of racism. I was recently in a Nike outlet store here in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and it was packed with a checkout line 30 people deep in the middle of summer.The technology sector leans to the left, led by Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., whose Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. Many consumers may complain about the liberal orientation of these companies, but there is not a lot they can do to avoid them. Sure, share prices of tech firms have stalled lately, but that’s more likely due to the threat of antitrust action than a reflection of their political orientation.The list of companies who have engaged in left-leaning speech, marketing or protest is getting long. The list of actions include pulling advertising from various Fox News programs, supporting the Women’s March, pulling products related to President Donald Trump from stores and banks dropping business with the certain gun makers. There have been few consequences, and no serious boycotts of these companies by conservatives, or at least none have been effective. Conservative media outlets had some fun with Procter & Gamble Co.’s $8 billion charge for Gillette, attributing it to backlash from an ad campaign asking men to “do better.” But the razor business has been bad for a while, with competitive threats coming from all sides. And more men are growing beards these days, so one is probably not related to the other.Corporate America may have declared a political orientation for strategic reasons. Companies today have more data and information than ever on their customers. What works for Nike may not work for Bass Pro Shops.Then there’s the waterfall of money that is earmarked for environment, social and governance, or ESG, investing strategies. It is the only form of active management that seems to be gathering assets even with a mixed track record when it comes to returns. The idea here is that companies engaging in socially responsible behavior should be rewarded by the stock market, but that isn’t always true. Indexing is widely considered to be a left-wing philosophy, the idea that you would invest in all companies equally, instead of trying to pick the best stocks. It has even famously been called worse than Marxism by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. As everyone knows, index fund assets have been growing at an astronomical pace. By some estimates, passive strategies now make up 40% to 50% of all assets under management, and it shows no signs of slowing down. Even actively managed funds with great performance are losing assets.We’ve come a long way from suspender-snapping, bull and bear cufflinks and “lunch is for wimps.” Back then, the idea that you would invest your money and not seek the highest return would have seemed odd.I assume that decisions to engage in political speech are carefully considered by managements, but I still find it disconcerting. I’m from a generation that grew up believing the job of a public company was to “make money,” not “do good.”  When they both align, then great, but what hasn’t changed is that people still like to see the value of their investments go up every year.To contact the author of this story: Jared Dillian at j.dillian@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robert Burgess at bburgess@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Jared Dillian is the editor and publisher of The Daily Dirtnap, investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, and the author of &quot;Street Freak&quot; and &quot;All the Evil of This World.&quot; He may have a stake in the areas he writes about.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",The Stock Market Has Become a Very Liberal Place

2019-09-04,"Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) is coming off a brutal August, the latest in a long line of rough months for the Canadian cannabis company. With each month of struggles, the shares become a little more tempting.Source: Shutterstock With an annual cannabis output that now exceeds 625,000 kilograms, it's easy to see why some investors may find Aurora stock attractive. The company offers scale in an often fragmented market. It's one of the world's largest cannabis producers and some of its core competencies include industry-leading output and logistical capabilities.Last month, the company released preliminary fiscal fourth-quarter results, including a forecast of sales of $100 million CAD to $107 million CAD. That's good for a roughly five-fold increase from the year-earlier period and 60% quarter-over-quarter growth. Those headlines temporarily bought ACB stock some goodwill among investors. However, as Aurora stock has often shown, making the good times last is easier said than done.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company's official quarterly earnings report is due out Sept. 15 and that should be a catalyst, in one way or another, for Aurora Cannabis stock. Management also upped its production outlook to 25,000 kilograms to 30,000 kilograms, above a previous forecast calling for 25,000 kilograms at the high end.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer noted that these preliminary results imply stronger-than-expected yields, which could help the company approach a cost per gram of less than $1 CAD, or 75 U.S. cents. Sourcing Growth for Aurora CannabisIntegral to the long-term thesis for Aurora stock is management's ability to find growth channels outside of Canada and the medicinal marijuana market. Those are viable growth opportunities, but they are largely baked into Aurora stock. By some forecasts, medicinal marijuana will see some contraction in the coming years.Morningstar's Kristoffer Inton said that he believes the medical market will shrink as recreational use is legalized. He also forecasts 20% average annual growth for the next decade, thanks to &quot;black-market&quot; consumers moving towards legal use.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now That's a perfect segue into talking about the U.S. Cannabis companies and investors are betting that increased U.S. legalization will bring recreational use out of the shadows. While some states have signed off on it, cannabis for medical and recreational purposes is illegal at the federal level in the U.S.Aurora Cannabis is eyeing the U.S. market in its own way, and acknowledges that a footprint south of it home market &quot;is nonnegotiable.&quot; There are plenty of other reasons why ACB stock could get a jolt. The company just needs U.S. policymakers' attitude toward cannabis to loosen up.&quot;Not only is the U.S. a larger opportunity, but it has a better economic model,&quot; GMP Securities analyst Rob Fagan told Barron's. &quot;In most states, you're allowed to go direct to your customer -- from production right up to retail -- cashing in on more of the value chain. There are also fewer restrictions on product forms and advertising than in Canada.&quot; Finding a Partner for ACB StockUnlike some of its rivals, Aurora Cannabis is currently without partners from the tobacco or beverage industries, although the company has admitted Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) would make for an appealing partner.This goes back to Aurora's relationship with activist investor Nelson Peltz. Peltz has famously (and successfully) pushed for change at companies such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN). However, the relationship with Peltz is something that is also baked into Aurora Cannabis stock. Investors are now demanding something substantive to come of his involvement.Inton said that Aurora Cannabis is limited in its potential to benefit from new partnerships. This is because of its lack of exposure in the U.S. market.For ACB stock, the writing is on the wall. The company must make a credible foray into the U.S. and execute on that endeavor, or risk generating dissatisfaction.The U.S. market remains an &quot;X factor&quot; for Canadian cannabis companies. But, the good news is that Aurora Cannabis stock is well below a credible fair value estimate of $9-$10.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"It feels like markets have been inching toward this point for some time. The point I'm referring to is some constructive commentary regarding trade between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com News hit the wires last night that representatives of the two  nations will meet in Washington, D.C. next month to discuss trade issues. The news sent markets soaring today. Importantly, the S&P 500 broke past some stiff resistance today, encouraging some technical analysts to opine that this rally might have some legs to it. That would be extraordinary, considering September's dubious reputation.Adding to stocks' gains today was a bullish private payroll survey from ADP, which showed the addition of 195,000 private sector jobs in August, easily topping the 148,000 new jobs economists, on average, had expected. The Department of Labor reveals its August jobs number tomorrow before the bell, with economists on average expecting the addition of 160,000 new jobs, with unemployment holding steady at 3.7% and wages growing 3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Today, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.75% while the S&P 500 climbed 1.31% to put the technically significant 3,100 level back in play. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.41%. In late trading, 27 of the Dow's 30 components were higher. Winners GaloreStoked by the trade news, tariff-sensitive Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was one of the Dow's best-performing names today, gaining more than 3%.Shares of Caterpillar &quot;headed for the biggest gain since April as trade tensions eased, improving the sales outlook for the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment,&quot; according to Bloomberg.Caterpillar's Thursday move wasn't surprising, but it was a pleasant surprise to see International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) keeping pace with Caterpillar for top honors in the Dow today.IBM, a good way for conservative investors to get some tech exposure, is on a torrid pace of late, up nearly 4% this week. With today's surge, the stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average. IBM stock could reach $150 to $155 in the near-term.Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) jumped more than 1% following some bullish analyst chatter. Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr likes United Technologies stock and recommends buying the name right here, right now.&quot;Investors seem fixated on the [Raytheon] merger but under-appreciate major cyclical turns at Otis [and] Pratt, [United Tech's] recession resistance, and likely [second-half earnings] beats,&quot; von Rumohr said in a Wednesday research report. &quot;With [the] separation [and] merger on track, transactional overhang should abate, offering upside to our $150 [price target].&quot;Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), a name I highlighted yesterday, also gained more than 1% today on news that the largest U.S. oil company is selling its Norwegian oil and gas assets for $4 billion. The move should help the company bolster its cash flow. Exxon's cash position is one reason some analysts remain enthusiastic about the stock. Odds And EndsWith investors flocking to riskier assets today, bond yields soared (finally), helping each of the Dow's financial services components trade noticeably higher on the day. That included Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).Underscoring banks' sensitivity to low interest rates, shares of Goldman jumped more than 2% despite noted bank analyst Dick Bove of Odeon Capital cutting his rating on the investment bank to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy.&quot; The analyst noted that GS' trimming some high level executives &quot;suggests an unhealthy level of turmoil.&quot;The Dow offenders today were defensive names Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). All fell by modest percentages. Bottom LineInvestors got significant help today on the trade front. Tomorrow is a new today and one that brings comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. If the jobs number is strong and the trade talks appear viable, investors hoping for more rate cuts may want to pin those hopes on 25, not 50, basis points. As it is, some market observers believe global central banks are close to running out of tools.&quot;The U.S. is not quite there yet, but we will see as soon as next month how much closer the ECB gets to monetary debasement (we think they're still some ways away, as they haven't fully exhausted their negative interest rate path, it seems),&quot; said BlackRock. &quot;Ironically, the beggar-thy-neighbor implications of competitive devaluations will almost certainly incite a response from countries who may not originally even have needed to resort to currency debasement in the first place, raising the potential for full blown currency war.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"Market volatility, tariff tensions with China, the inverted bond yield curve – all are coming together now and prompting recession fears. The factors are linked. The trade war with China is escalating (new tariffs on $112 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect on September 1), increasing the chances of a more direct impact on the American consumer’s wallet and adding to recession-related worries. Nervous investors are more likely to buy and sell, adding to volatility. The lack of short-term confidence pushes up the cost of the 2-year bond, driving it above the 10-year bond. The inverted yield curve is widely seen as an early predictor of recession, occurring as much as two years before an actual downturn.So, it’s fair to say that the sky, for investors, is growing cloudy. There may be trouble on the horizon, but of what sort, it’s hard to say. It does, however, make the present the best time to buy into the classic defensive stocks. These are companies that focus on staples, in food and drink, or home health products, or low-cost family entertainment, that bring in steady return no matter the economic conditions. They offer investors strong fundamentals and reliable dividends.We’ll look at four here, all blue-chip investments, including one of Warren Buffett’s favorites, based on the TipRanks Stock Screener. Coca-Cola Company (KO)Warren Buffett loves Coke. He doesn’t hide it; he’s sat in front of Congress with a Coke in hand. And along with his love of the cola, he loves the stock. The Coca-Cola Company meets some of Buffett’s chief criteria for a long-term investment: It has an excellent reputation and one of the world’s best-known brands supporting a business that can practically run itself. As Buffett is reported to have told Bill Gates, “A ham sandwich could run Coca-Cola.”The reputation and branding are the keys. In a less facetious moment, Buffett also once said, “If you gave me $100 billion and said take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I'd give it back to you and say it can't be done.” Buffett’s confidence is built on Coke’s moat, a term Buffett uses for the protection the company gains from its long-term ability to protect its business niche and market share. In addition, Buffett appreciates Coke’s dividend. While modest, at 2.89%, it provides a steady $1.60 per share annually.Buffett is not the only fan of Coca-Cola stock. Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian recently met with the company’s CFO and came away convinced that KO is poised for further growth. He noted three reasons why Coke’s future is bright: “Improved execution and relationships with bottler partners worldwide; a focus on smaller and higher priced goods; and new product innovation, which accounts for 25% of total revenue versus 15% just two years ago.” Mohsenian gives KO shares a price target of $60, suggesting an upside potential of 8%.Overall, KO shares hold a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 6 buy and 5 hold ratings set in the last three months. Shares are selling for $55 in today’s trading, and the average price target of $57 gives the stock a potential upside of 3%. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Like Coke, Johnson & Johnson has an easily recognizable brand. From its ‘no more tears’ baby shampoo to Band Aids, Tylenol, and Listerine, the company’s products are widely used and perennially popular. Along with the company’s pharmaceutical line, which includes drugs to treat autoimmune conditions, cancer, hepatitis, and depression, these products give JNJ the same type of moat that defends Coca-Cola. The company shares its success through a 2.95% dividend, with a $3.80 annualized payout.Even strong defensive stocks can feel pressure, however, and JNJ has had some bed news recently. The company was named as a defendant in a Federal lawsuit brought by the State of Oklahoma, seeking damages for the epidemic of opioid addiction in the US. In a decision last month, a Federal judge JNJ liable for up to $572 million.While hardly good news, the lawsuit and verdict did not deter 5-star analyst Joanne Wuensch, of BMO Capital, from setting a buy rating on the stock. She noted the company is not required to pay anything until after the appeals process, which can easily last until 2021, and that JNJ has the cash on hand to simply pay the judgement now if it chooses. In her note, she says, “Notwithstanding the $15.2 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities on the second-quarter balance sheet and its AAA credit rating, J&J is not into the habit of accruing legal payments until they are probable and reasonably estimated. We remind investors that litigation is long, lengthy, and difficult to read, and while the amount is less than it could have been, we would expect an extended resolution.” She put a $157 price target JNJ shares, implying an upside of 21%.Her optimism is shared by Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford. While declining to set a specific price target on the stock, Bedford agrees with Wuensch about the likely long-term path of the litigation. He says, “After speaking with management, we remain optimistic in the defense case for J&J when heading to the appellate courts and ultimately believe the $572M will likely be reduced.” In line with his optimism, he gives JNJ shares a firm buy rating.The analyst consensus on Johnson & Johnson is another Moderate Buy, based on an even split of 4 buys and 4 holds. In a sign of the stock’s underlying strength, the $151 average price target suggests an upside of 17% from the share price of $128. Procter & Gamble Company (PG)Since the spring of 2018, Procter & Gamble has been showing steady share price growth, regardless of the broader market conditions. In an obvious indicator of the stock’s steady growth, PG is up 32% year-to-date.Procter & Gamble has built its success on a diverse line-up of home-health and cleaning products, including Tide laundry detergent, Ivory soap, Pampers, Crest toothpaste, and Charmin toilet paper. For the most part, these are true staple products, needed in every household, and they underlie PG’s $67 billion-plus per year in revenue. The company shares those revenues with investors, through a dividend. Like the other stocks in this list, PG’s dividend offers a modest yield, at 2.46%, but offsets that with a $2.98 annualized payout and a reliable payment history.Morgan Stanley’s Dara Mohsenian, quoted above on Coca-Cola, is also bullish on PG. He gives the stock a $129 price target, and said that the company’s recently completed fiscal year gave “…greater confidence in our thesis that the company's market share gains and strong category pricing can continue to drive above-consensus topline growth. Coupled with P&G's outsized gross margin expansion, we expect higher EPS growth than peers.” Mohsenian’s price target suggests 5% upside to the stock.PG’s recent gains have pushed the stock right up to its $122 average target. The share price is now $121, leaving room for just a 1% upside. This is reflected in the Moderate Buy analyst consensus, based on 4 buys and 5 holds from the past three months. Walt Disney Company (DIS)The House of Mouse is a perennial strong performer, based on the solid foundation of the famed Disney Vault, a near-century’s worth of animated and live action family films, and the universal brand of Mickey Mouse. Disney has defended both its reputation and its profitability over the years, partly by producing consistently high-quality films, partly by making smart acquisitions, and partly by adapting to changes in the movie industry. The company now owns the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, along with a cruise line, consumer products like Disney Princesses, and ESPN.This array of entertainment business is enormously lucrative, and in its last fiscal year Disney recorded almost $60 billion in revenues and over $12 billion in net income. Shareholders benefit directly from the 1.29% dividend yield, which gives them a payout of $1.76 per share annually. The company is using its income and cash flow to continue its history of adaptation to changing conditions; Disney will launch a streaming service later this year, competing directly with giants like Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL) in the online TV-on-demand space. The Disney Vault – a giant well of fully-owned content of proven popularity – will undoubtedly give the Mouse a leg up in that competition.5-star analyst Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial reviewed Disney last week and affirmed his upbeat outlook on the stock. He believes a recent pullback in share price offers investors a point of entry, and writes, “[We see] the company's continued accelerating business performance from its strong studio results and expect the ramp of its DTC streaming service to generate increasing return on capital. This stock is in our Research Focus List and also our Focus Opportunity Portfolio. Management is still investing significant cash in new growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions.”Of the four stocks in this list, Disney is the one with a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock has received 11 buys and 3 holds over the past three months, a clear sign of investor confidence. The average price target of $156 suggests an upside potential of 14% from the share price of $136.Visit TipRanks’ Analysts Top Stocks page to find out which companies have the attention of Wall Street’s best analysts.",4 Defensive Dividend Stocks for Steady Returns

2019-09-17,"Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) joined companies like Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) when its recent earnings report sent ACB stock on a 9% tumble.Source: Shutterstock Because of this, there has been a wide-scale bear move. The fact is that investors have been too optimistic about the growth prospects from Canada. There have also been issues with supply chains in the country as well as black market activities.So when may things change?  It may take a while.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut even before this, the ACB stock price had been under increasing pressure. Since March, the shares have gone from $10 to $5.70.Now, as for the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report for the company, there was still lots of growth. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, revenues jumped by 52%. There was also an annual 72% ramp.  * 7 Tech Stocks You Should Avoid Now Yet Wall Street wanted much more. ACB reported C$98.9 million on the top-line while the consensus was calling for C$103 million. Note that before this the company had tempered its annual guidance.Something else about the earnings report that likely weighed on Aurora Cannabis stock was the softness in the global business. Consider that there was only a 12% increase in the medical segment in Europe to C$4.5 million.InvestorPlace.com's Josh Enomoto summed things up as follows:&quot;The cannabis market has stepped out of the honeymoon phase and into the 'show me' phase. In other words, investors are tired of hearing bedtime stories. Instead, they want some evidence that these tales are based on facts.&quot; Bad News for ACB StockAurora Cannabis stock got hit again this week, off about 4%. The reason: negative commentary from Stifel Nicolaus analyst Andrew Carter. Primarily because of the earnings report, especially with the sluggishness in foreign markets, he slapped a &quot;sell&quot; rating on the shares. He lowered his price target from C$7 to C$5.He also thinks the terrible sentiment in the cannabis sector will make it more difficult for Aurora Cannabis to raise more money. No doubt, this could mean that any equity offering could see substantial dilution - which could mean even further deterioration of the stock price. An Upside for ACB StockDespite all the bad news, there remain silver linings. Aurora Cannabis has the advantage of scale and a global infrastructure (there are 15 production facilities, with sales and operations in 25 countries). For example, during the quarter the company produced over 29,000 kilograms, compared to 15,590 for the prior quarter.Another advantage for Aurora Cannabis stock is that it has Nelson Peltz as a strategic advisor. He is a top activist investor who has extensive experience with consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN). Peltz should be invaluable in providing high-level contacts and funding resources.And finally, there is the catalyst of &quot;Legalization 2.0.&quot; This refers to when Canada will legalize the sale of cannabis edibles, beverages and vaping products. The law will require a 60-day permit process, after which sales will be allowed.This should help to boost revenues. However, in light of the concerns with cannabis companies right now, there may not much action with Aurora Cannabis stock until next year. So for now, there is probably no rush to make a buy.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction. Follow him on Twitter at @ttaulli.

2019-09-18,"As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates today by 25 basis points, but that wasn't enough to spark upside for equities. Nor was it enough for President Donald Trump who criticized the Fed for lacking &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;vision&quot; because it didn't lower rates by 50 basis points.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Three Fed governors voted against today's rate cut, prompting some investors to express concern about the path forward.&quot;In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective,&quot; the Federal Open Market Committee wrote in a statement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.So today the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1% while the S&P 500 added just 0.03%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%. In late trading, half of the Dow stocks were pointed higher. The only sector in the U.S. that closed higher today was, unsurprisingly, utilities. Small Winners CircleThere weren't many Dow winners today and among that small group, the gains were, well, small. One surprise was JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Financial services stocks usually benefit from higher interest rates, and JPM and its rival banks have recently been complaining about the effects lower rates have on their net interest margins. In late trading JPM was the only financial services name in the Dow trading higher.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars Another surprise, though of the disappointing variety, was Merck (NYSE:MRK). This Dow component barely nudged higher despite some encouraging news about its Keytruda cancer treatment. Regulators in Australia, Canada and the U.S. approved Keytruda to treat advanced endometrial carcinoma.This is significant news, but the stock barely moved higher today. Hey, it's not everyday three major developed markets approve a cancer treatment on the same day.&quot;Merck said regulators approved the use of Keytruda with a drug called Lenvima, discovered by the Japanese company Eisai (OTCMKTS:ESALY), to treat some instances of advanced endometrial carcinoma, a serious condition for which patients currently have few options,&quot; Josh Nathan-Kazis wrote for Barron's.Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was a Dow winner today, and like the others, it was in modest fashion. P&G is one of the Dow's best-performing names this year. And some traders are getting bullish about options on the consumer goods giant's shares. Apple, AgainYes, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been making a lot of appearances here in recent days -- and the iPhone maker is back today. Wedbush released a note earlier today forecasting 185 million in iPhone 11 shipments for fiscal 2020. Analysts also wrote that pre-orders for the phone in the U.S. have been strong.Up nearly 8% this month, Apple has been one of the best-performing Dow stocks in September. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt's clear that market participants are focusing on the Fed's division. However, because the central bank did not cut by 50 basis points today, it has another 25 basis point cut in its back pocket. Chairman Jerome Powell overtly said that the Fed can deploy more rate reductions if the economy sours, which he doesn't see happening right now.Speaking of the economy, the Fed upped its 2019 gross domestic product forecast to growth of 2.2%. That's up slightly from June's estimate of 2.1%. For now, the central bank is standing firm on its forecast of 2% GDP growth in 2020.As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-18,"Consumer staples stocks have largely fallen off the radar in recent months. Investors have been much more focused on growth as corporate earnings have pleasantly surprised, the U.S.-China trade spat showed signs of hope and the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady.Naturally, these more defensive companies haven't been especially red-hot of late. Consumer staples stocks have lagged the marketwide bounce that took shape beginning in late December. But with many other sectors starting to feel the weight of unwieldy gains, and with China trade talks yet again hitting turbulence, the sector might be ready to heat up again.Steve Azoury, founder of financial planning firm Azoury Financial, says, &quot;Consumer staples, the products that people use every day, will always be a big part of America's economy.&quot; &quot;The trick,&quot; he adds, is identifying the companies that &quot;will stay innovative and update their products and services to excite their customers, and thus the stock prices for investors.&quot;Here are 17 of the best consumer staples stocks to invest in at the moment. While some of these are blue-chip stocks that should ring a bell, others are lesser-known companies that serve as the backbone of brands you may be more familiar with.

2019-10-11,"Once again, the big news for the Dow Jones today was all about the U.S.-China trade get together. The result was excellent news for stocks as the major domestic equity benchmarks surged to end the week on news that the world's two largest economies reached a partial trade accord.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com As I've been noting over the course of this week, a smaller trade deal was an idea previously eschewed by President Trump, but he appeared to come around to the idea. Earlier today, the president said on Twitter &quot;good things&quot; were happening in the trade talks, even going so far as to describe the talks as &quot;warm.&quot;That's a significant, positive departure from Trump's often bellicose China rhetoric and stocks certainly liked those good vibes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose warm and fuzzy trade feelings are critical because the U.S. was set to impose tariffs on some Chinese goods as soon as next week with another batch of levies slated to go into effect in mid-December. Should President Trump sign the deal currently being discussed, those tariffs would be avoided and a broader trade truce could be reached by the two sides.With trade talks progressing nicely, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.34%, while the S&P 500 soared 1.09%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.31% to finish the week with 27 of the Dow's 30 stocks in late trading. The offenders were defensive names -- Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) -- but losses for those names were modest. Apple at an All-Time HighShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued their recently scintillating pace, gaining 2.74% to hit a record high. Of course, some today's Apple ebullience is attributable to good news on the trade front, but there was streaming news to consider as well. That's important because the Apple + streaming platform is close to its debut.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now Apple +, which debuts on Nov. 1, could be a real thorn in the side of rival Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and be a major boon for Apple investors, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note out today.&quot;If Apple is successful with its latest streaming endeavor and reaches some of these potential subs/revenues numbers annually we estimate, this will add roughly $15 per share to our sum-of-the-parts valuation on Apple,&quot; said the analyst.He raised his Apple price target to $265 from $245. AAPL stock closed around $236 and with Apple in rally mode, expect more upward price target revisions because the average target on the name is just $228. Cyclical ContributorsStock-specific news was light today for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dow (NYSE:DOW), but those cyclical names were the Dow's top two performers today, each gaining more than 5% on the positive trade news.In either case, Friday's rallies in the names isn't an overreaction because both have displayed high sensitivity to trade headlines. Caterpillar's surge today was particularly impressive because it occurred on above-average volume. Straight to the BankThird-quarter earnings season is about to ramp up and that means an avalanche of reports from the financial services next week. Yes, the group is heading into earnings amid concerns about lower interest rates suppressing net interest margins, analyst downgrades and negative profit revisions.However, all of the Dow's financial services names gained today with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, gaining 1.69%. It's difficult to say bank stocks are buys right here, but the aforementioned negative factors are widely known and should be priced into these names at this point. A Swoosh HigherNike (NYSE:NKE), another member of the trade-sensitive club, added to recent gains today after Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and $98 price target on the stock. That implies modest upside from the $94 area Nike closed at today.&quot;With the broader consumer shift towards digital, we think at some point Nike will rationalize its factory store footprint as it assesses each store's productivity,&quot; said the analyst. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThere have been some earnings calls already and one issue that has been popping is currency exchange-traded rates. While interest rates have come down in the U.S., the dollar has been mostly firm this year and that's problematic for export-dependent sectors.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 &quot;Foreign exchange has again been cited on the most earnings calls to date (12) as a factor that either had a negative impact on earnings or revenues in Q2 or is expected to have a negative impact on earnings and revenues in future quarters,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;More than half (55%) of the S&P 500 companies that have conducted earnings conference calls to date for the second quarter have cited some negative impact from foreign exchange rates.&quot;Fortunately, part of the trade deal with China includes currency controls. Hopefully China keeps up its end of the bargain and doesn't devalue the yuan again.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But billionaires also see plenty of potential in stable blue chips like the Dow Jones Industrial Average's components. Indeed, Dow stocks make up considerable portions of some high-profile managers' portfolios.Billionaire investors often are viewed as more sophisticated, better informed and more likely to enter what would be considered more esoteric trades than the average investor. In some cases, those assumptions are true.But there's something to be said about safety, as well as the ability of some well-known large-cap stocks to deliver surprisingly outsize returns. Big-time money managers know that - and have put their money where their brains are.Investors of every ilk would be wise to take the hint and consider following that lead.Here are seven Dow stocks that make up a large chunk of at least one billionaire investor's holdings.

2019-10-15,"Boom and bust cycles can easily last a few years.  A classic case is the dot-com cycle, when lasted from 1998 to 2000, giving investors time to snag juicy returns.But  cannabis stocks have been different. Their boom-bust cycle only lasted a year or so. And it is far from clear if marijuana stocks have bottomed.Source: Shutterstock The silver lining is that the valuations of marijuana stocks have become much more attractive, while their growth outlook appears to be intact.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Hot Stocks Staging Huge Reversals There are a variety of high-quality marijuana stocks that investors can consider buying. But let's take a look at one: Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB).Granted, the chart of ACB stock is downright scary. During the past year, Aurora Cannabis stock has gone from $12 to $3.77.While the valuation of ACB stock is still far from cheap, its growth remains particularly strong. Ultimately, that should lead to higher margins and profits, which will make Aurora stock more attractive. The Pros of ACB StockAurora has operations across 25 countries on five continents. Besides a thriving consumer business, ACB also has an extensive medical operation, as it employs more than 40 highly educated researchers, and has conducted a long list of clinical trials and case studies. What's more, the company is making a big play for the CBD-based wellness category, which is likely to become a multi-billion dollar business in the US. The Cons of ACB StockIt's true that ACB stock is facing a great deal of risk. The Canadian cannabis market has been beset with difficulties, as its supply chain has been problematic and it's been hurt by the continuing strength of the black market. Additionally,  Hexo's (NYSE:HEXO) negative earnings preannouncement was a sign that the cannabis sector's growth may be decelerating.Moreover,  vaping may  have caused a number of  deaths. While the ultimate cause  of the deaths is unclear, they have damaged the cannabis industry's image. The Bottom Line on Aurora Cannabis StockAll in all, these are serious problems, and it will take some time to deal with them.  But then again, Wall Street has been factoring all this into ACB stock.  So even a small amount of good news could easily spark a rally by Aurora stock.But it's important to keep in mind that  there are some potential catalysts that can help get ACB stock back on track. One is Cannabis 2.0. This refers to the legalization of CBD edibles, topicals and beverages in Canada. According to Deloitte, those products could generate $2.7 billion of revenue.Next, ACB has a top-notch strategic advisor, the legendary Nelson Peltz. He runs an activist investment fund and has taken positions in companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN). No doubt, he'll be able to leverage his own network to identify strategic partners and investors.Granted, despite all this, ACB stock will likely remain volatile. So it's probably best to refrain from buying too many shares of Aurora stock initially. But in the long-term, ACB does look like it has what it takes to be a winner.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-10-18,"The Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock price has risen 28% so far in 2019, reaching a new all-time high. But the  rally of Walmart stock doesn't yet seem justified by the performance of its business.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Indeed, Walmart's growth this fiscal year, even after it raised its guidance a few months ago, hardly looks impressive. The company expects its annual earnings per share, excluding certain items, to be little changed versus last year's EPS.Losses from India's Flipkart, in which Walmart acquired a majority stake last year, are hurting its bottom line. Excluding those losses, the company's post-Q2 outlook suggests &quot;mid-to high single-digit percentage&quot;growth of its EPS for the full year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStill, Walmart stock is trading at about 24 times that EPS guidance. That's the stock's highest earnings multiple in at least a decade. And it can be argued that 24 times earnings for 8% or so growth is too expensive.  * 7 Reasons to Buy Canopy Growth Stock In fact, I've expressed some skepticism towards the current valuation of Walmart stock. And I still don't feel compelled to buy WMT stock. But the case for buying Walmart stock at $120 is stronger than its headline earnings multiples might suggest. Still,  buying WMT stock at its current levels requires trust not only in the company, but in the American economy. WMT Has Become a Better CompanyThe bullish view of WMT stock is that Walmart simply is a much better company than it's been in years. Its grocery business has been re-energized, and clearly has taken market share from the likes of Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Albertsons. Kroger is guiding for same-sales growth excluding fuel this year of 2%-2.25%. Based on Walmart's outlook.its U.S. business should come in closer to 3% growth,Meanwhile, Walmart has moved heavily into e-commerce, both through acquisitions and by expanding its own online business. Walmart's Marketplace is becoming a serious rival to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).And WMT seems to have finally cracked the code of the online grocery business, which had been a graveyard for capital going back to the failures of Webvan and Peapod in the beginning of the last decade.It's probably an exaggeration  to call Walmart's efforts a turnaround. But it's easy to forget that Walmart's sales stagnated in the first half of this decade and so did the WMT stock price. The stock was dead money for about four years between 2013 and 2017. It's now risen 40% in the last two years, thanks to an accelerating top line and increasing confidence in its ability to grow its earnings going forward. The Story Sounds FamiliarWhat's interesting about Walmart stock at the moment is that its journey sounds similar to that of other U.S. large-cap consumer companies. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) traded sideways from about 2012 through the end of 2015.Its future seemed at risk amidst the growth of &quot;fast casual&quot; competition and a focus on healthy eating. But CEO Steve Easterbrook, hired in early 2015, rolled out &quot;all day breakfast&quot;, refranchised owned restaurants, and  MCD stock doubled.Last year, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock was unchanged versus early 2013. The external pressures on it seemed intense, as private-label products sold at the likes of Walmart and Kroger were hurting PG's results. Neither an aggressive cost-cutting plan nor a move to sell off smaller brands had worked. But P&G finally managed to accelerate its revenue growth to 5%, excluding acquisitions, in fiscal 2019. PG stock, too has soared. It gained a whopping 75% from its 2018 lows before its recent pullback.What we've seen is that if a U.S. large-cap company can convince the market that it is well-positioned, its stock is going to climb. And it's likely to move farther, and often faster, than fundamental analysis might suggest. The WMT Stock Price Is Partially Built on TrustIf that trend holds for Walmart stock, it can rise well above its current level. But that's a big &quot;if&quot; for two reasons.First, in terms of the other large-cap stocks, the obvious worry is that their valuations have gone too far. Like WMT stock, PG, for example,  trades at 24 times its earnings, and it's modestly growing.  The valuation of many &quot;safe&quot; stocks, including WMT stock, look potentially stretched.Second, Walmart's strategy has to pay off. The long-running worry about WMT stock  has been that its e-commerce and omnichannel growth will be good for sales - but won't necessarily boost its profits.The ability of Target (NYSE:TGT) to deliver bottom-line growth after spending billions on its omnichannel business likely eases that fear. Still, an investor buying WMT stock at $120 has to believe that its e-commerce growth will add to its earnings and not just its top line. The Case for Walmart StockThat said, an investor reasonably could see both risks as overdone. As far as valuation goes, it's clear that long-term interest rate expectations have come down. If Walmart can grow its earnings even 6% per year, while the ten-year U.S. government bonds yield less than 2%, investors are going to pay for that growth. 24 times EPS for a company that's growing at 8% sounds high to those of us who have invested for decades. But it may no longer be high.As far as the concerns about its omnichannel business go, the rebuttal is simple: it's working. Walmart is a legitimate rival to Amazon. The latter company is valued at almost $900 billion, and perhaps close to $500 billion excluding its Amazon Web Services business. In that context, is the $337 billion market capitalization of Walmart stock too high? An investor could quite easily argue that it's too low.Still, an investor needs to have a lot of trust in WMT stock to buy its at its highs. She needs to trust the company's strategy and the market. If that trust is justified, there's a path for WMT to follow MCD, PG, and other stocks higher.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-10-22,"We're getting into a very busy week of earnings and it shows on our top stock trades. However, we're trying to look beyond the quarterly results and focus on other stocks that are also making waves. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Lyft (LYFT)Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock caught a lift on Tuesday after reports began circulating that management is looking for EBITDA profits to surface about a year before analysts currently expect.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe move sent shares higher by 8% at one point, as Lyft stock ran right into its 50-day moving average.On the plus side, the stock is out of that nasty little downtrend. The bad news? The charts still look pretty gnarly.A move above the 50-day could spring Lyft to the $48 area. Not only has this mark played a significant role as both support and resistance, but it also marks the 78.6% retracement. On the downside, see that recent support at $40 holds. Falling below that level puts the October low back on the table. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Shopify (SHOP)We have been cautious on high-growth stocks lately. With Tuesday's continued selloff in the group, that caution has been reinforced.Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) is a great company, but it has a high valuation and hasn't come down as hard as many of its peers. But the technical damage is starting to show. Shares failed to reclaim the 78.6% retracement and 50-day moving average earlier this month.After the rejection, shares ultimately lost the 100-day moving average and channel support (blue line). If it loses the 61.8% retracement, the $286 lows from September are most definitely on the table.Below those lows and we may finally get a test of the 200-day moving average. That also comes into play just above the 50% retracement. Unlike some of its peers, SHOP stock has not hit the down-40% mark. To do so, Shopify would need to hit around $246. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Procter & Gamble (PG)Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) neared its all-time highs on Tuesday, after a top- and bottom-line earnings beat. However, investors are hesitating to bid the stock higher. What gives?Over the 50-day moving average is constructive, as is the stock being over $122.50. Investors may rather wait for a move its prior highs though, which could trigger a rally toward $130. On the downside, consider buying dips into the 100-day moving average and uptrend support (blue line).Below the former and PG will need more time to set up on the long side. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Lockheed Martin (LMT)Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is an interesting one too. After a beat-and-raise quarter, LMT is actually lower on the day. Hmm…If the stock can hold over $371, tempted bulls can hang with LMT. However, a move below Tuesday's low (and thus the notable $370 level and the 78.6% retracement at $365.79) would make the stock a no-touch for the time being.Over $371 and the 100-day moving average, makes a move to the 50-day possible. Above that and $390-plus is possible. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: United Parcel Service (UPS)United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) turned in a mixed quarter, beating on earnings by a penny but missing on revenue expectations. However, management backed its full-year guidance.As such, shares were able to erase a bulk of its early losses Tuesday.The chart for this one is pretty sloppy. I'm not a big head-and-shoulder guy, but this one has all the makings of one. A close below $112 -- which fittingly comes into play near Tuesday's low and the 100-day moving average -- would be a bearish sign for the stock. It puts the $104 to $110 area on the table.Over $116 and the 78.6% retracement, could spark a move to the 50-day moving average up near $117.50. Above that and $120 is on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell is long cheesy Lyft puns.

On a related note, Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were two of the best-performing members of the blue chip index today.In comments made at an energy conference in Texas earlier today, Steve Green, president of Chevron's North American business, said the Permian Basin isn't vulnerable to the boom-and-bust cycles that have been part of U.S. oil regions for generations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;We see a long, healthy pace of activity in the Permian and Texas for decades to come,&quot; said Green, reports Bloomberg.Boosting shares of Exxon were reports that Democratic frontrunner Sen.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.15% as 22 of its 30 components were higher in late trading. Leaders Incur Some PunishmentI've noted multiple times over the past several months that Travelers (NYSE:TRV) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) have been two of the stronger Dow stocks this year, but that leadership, particularly in the case of Travelers, was dealt a significant blow Tuesday when earnings reports from both companies disappointed investors.Insurance giant Travelers plunged 8.13%, by far the worst performance in the Dow today, after the company reported third-quarter earnings of $1.50 per share. That's down from $2.62 a share a year earlier and well below the consensus estimate of $2.35 a share. Travelers revenue rose to $8.01 billion from $7.72 billion.Shares of McDonald's slid 4.57%, good for the second-worst showing in the Dow today behind Travelers. The McDonald's loss was accrued on volume that was more than double the daily average.McDonald's said it earned $2.11 a share on sales of $5.43 billion. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $2.21 on revenue of $5.47 billion. The company did say same-store sales increased by 5.9% globally and 4.8% in the U.S. Ongoing LeadershipWhile some Dow leaders dealt with weakness today, that was not the case for Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer products giant gained 2.57% after it extended its now lengthy strength of beating Wall Street earnings estimates.In the most recently completed quarter, P&G posted earnings per share of $1.37 from revenue of $17.8 billion. Analysts expected $1.24 a share and $17.4 billion of revenue. The stock is now up nearly 30% year-to-date. Industrial InterestShares of industrial conglomerate United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) were in the upper tier of Dow performers, gaining 2.16% on more than double the average daily volume, a gain that appears to have triggered an impressive upside technical breakout.UTX earnings were decent, but today's price action was more the result of bullish guidance.&quot;Our strong performance through the first three quarters gives us confidence in the improved adjusted EPS range of $8.05 to $8.15 and free cash flow range of $5.3 to $5.7 billion for the year,&quot; said CEO Gregory Hayes in a statement.  * 7 Software Stocks to Buy for Growth  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWith 2019 drawing to a close, it's safe to say this has been an eventful year and more of the same is likely in store in 2020 with an upcoming presidential election.

That said, even in the absence of a formal recession slowing growth suggests over-weighting less volatile and higher quality companies.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-25,"There were plenty of important earnings reports to digest today, but stocks appeared to take their cues from good news on the U.S.-China trade front with the major equity benchmarks approaching all-time highs on word that trade talks are progressing in positive fashion.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com &quot;They made headway on specific issues and the two sides are close to finalizing some sections of the agreement,&quot; according to a statement out earlier today from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's office.President Trump is pushing to sign the first phase of the trade accord next month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Chile.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe trade talk helped the Nasdaq Composite advance 0.70%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.41%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered higher by 0.57%. Give the Nasdaq some credit. Today's gains were built without much from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which was beaten up after its third-quarter earnings report. Or maybe Amazon itself deserves some credit because it closed the day at $1,761, well above the day lows around $1,695. Tech SupportOn Thursday, I mentioned the importance of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) earnings report in terms of propping up the semiconductor space in the wake of the disaster that was Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) earlier this week.  * 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow Up Intel delivered in epic fashion, surging almost 8% to easily rank as the Dow's best-performing member today. The semiconductor giant posted third-quarter earnings of $1.42 per share on revenue of $19.2 billion. Those numbers absolutely crushed what Wall Street was expecting, which was $1.24 per share on $18.1 billion. Dogs BounceTwo of this year's most frequently mentioned Dow dogs, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and 3M (NYSE:MMM), were the next best performers in the blue chip index today after Intel. Certainly in the case of Caterpillar, these were probably China news-driven trades. Both companies reported earnings earlier this week and neither report was particularly strong, so today's bounces in these embattled names may be no more than trades, not opportunities to be long these stocks for lengthy time frames. Post-Earnings MalaiseVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) reported decent third-quarter results earlier today, but investors weren't overly enthusiastic about the numbers as the stock was one of the Dow losers on the day.Verizon said it earned $1.25 per share on revenue of $32.9 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.24 a share on revenue of $32.7 billion. Making matters interesting in terms of Verizon's price action today was subscriber growth that beat estimates. In theory, the stock should have been up on that news.&quot;The company's consumer unit added a net 193,000 new wireless postpaid lines and its business segment added a net 408,000,&quot; according to Barron's. &quot;That leaves a total of 601,000 new customers who receive a monthly bill, a closely watched metric for wireless companies. Wall Street analysts had been expect 524,000 new postpaid wireless subscribers.&quot; Another Surprise LoserDow high-fly act Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was one of the index's offenders today, which is surprising given the tenor of a Morgan Stanley note out earlier today on the stock.Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian said &quot;P&G is likely to be able to increase its revenues faster than its peers even if it raises prices only modestly, given its broad-based strength,&quot; according to Barron's.He reiterated an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $134 price target on the Dow component.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayNext week brings another raft earnings reports, including some big-name technology stocks and some members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With that in mind, this earnings season has been decent relative to earlier expectations.&quot;To date, 40% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q3 2019. In terms of earnings, the percentage of companies reporting actual EPS above estimates (80%) is above the five-year average,&quot; according to FactSet Research data. &quot;In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 3.8% above the estimates, which is below the five-year average. In terms of sales, the percentage of companies (64%) reporting actual sales above estimates is above the five-year average. In aggregate, companies are reporting sales that are 1.1% above estimates, which is also above the five-year average.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-01,"Although it's true to that people have to eat, that notion doesn't always make for the most valid investment thesis. Still, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP), the largest exchange traded fund (ETF) dedicated to that sector, is higher by nearly 21% year-to-date.Traditional consumer staples ETFs like XLP are diverse in the ways of this sector. These funds are not dedicated food ETFs. Rather, they combine exposure to food and beverage stocks, such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) along with consumer products giants like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).Industry-level diversity usually works for investors, but when it comes to food ETFs, the hunt looks a little bit like the one for restaurant ETFs. The need for nourishment and demand for dining would seem to imply that there are plenty of related funds, but the opposite is actually true.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November However, there are few credible, solid ideas for investors to put some grub on the table and in the bank with the following food ETFs. Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (PBJ)Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com Expense ratio: 0.63%The Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSEARCA:PBJ) is one of the oldest dedicated food and beverage ETFs having debuted over 14 years ago. PBJ also epitomizes the search for food ETFs in that it includes an &quot;and.&quot; That's usually the case as fund issuers figure it's more efficient to mix food and drink together under the umbrella of single ETF.PBJ follows the Dynamic Food & Beverage Intellidex Index, which is a different animal than the benchmarks used by many prosaic consumer staples ETFs. This food ETF's index &quot;is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value,&quot; according to Invesco.While PBJ holds food and beverage basics such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), the fund allocates nearly a quarter of its weight to consumer discretionary stocks, including McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). That gives PBJ the ability, in the right consumer environment, to potentially outperform traditional staples ETFs.Bottom line: this food ETF offers investors a bit more spice than they'll find with the XLP's of the world. First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF (FTXG)Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com Expense ratio: 0.60%The First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF (NASDAQ:FTXG) represents another smart beta approach to food ETFs. This First Trust food ETF, which is just over three years old, follows the Nasdaq US Smart Food & Beverage Index.That index pulls 30 stocks from a broader Nasdaq benchmark and scores those names based on trailing 12-month volatility, value as measured by price-to-cash flow and growth using a combination of three-, six-, nine- and 12-month price appreciation.As far as food ETFs go, FTXG is one of the more pure names out there as it allocates almost 80% of its weight to stocks classified as food product names, according to issuer data.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now For as unique as its weighting methodology is, FTXG's 28-stock roster looks traditional with names such as Pepsi, Kellogg (NYSE:K), General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and Coca-Cola, among others. The Organics ETF (ORG)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.35%Often overlooked in the food ETF conversation, the Organics ETF (NASDAQ:ORG), as its name implies, is a play on healthy eating trends. ORG tracks the Solactive Organics Index.&quot;ORG includes global companies that capitalize on the growth in naturally-derived food and personal care items, such as companies that service, produce, distribute, market or sell organic food, beverage, cosmetics, supplements, or packaging,&quot; according to ETF Trends.While over 86% of ORG's weight is allocated to food makers and retailers, giving this fund serious food ETF credibility, there's some concentration risk to consider as its top three holdings combine for nearly a third of the fund's weight.In its favor, ORG is the least expensive of the food ETFs highlighted here.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-01,"An earnings season-driven rally for U.S. stocks came to an end on Thursday. The S&P 500 ended a streak of all-time closing highs, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped half a percentage point despite a 2.3% rally in component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).Source: Shutterstock To be sure, modest declines in a single session don't suggest market gains have come to an end. But Thursday's news -- including a big miss for the Chicago Purchasing Management Index and conflicting reports on the trade front -- likely was an unwelcome reminder for investors. Earnings reports remain strong for U.S. companies, but external risks persist.Friday's three big stock charts highlight that mixed sentiment. They include two companies who posted earnings beats on Thursday and saw their share prices dip anyway. Combined with another well-known company with big exposure to China, these big stock charts show the uncertainty in the market at the moment, even with market indices so close to all-time highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Altria (MO)Technically and fundamentally, the pullback in Altria (NYSE:MO) on Thursday looks concerning. After all, there's an obvious case for Altria stock at the moment. MO stock is cheap at 10x forward earnings. A 7.3% dividend yield is one of the highest among large-cap stocks, and still looks well-covered by cash flow.Obviously, vaping-related concerns around Juul, in which the company has taken a stake, are a key factor. But I wrote last month that increased regulation might actually help both Altria and Juul, The first of our three big stock charts, however, shows that investors weren't buying that case on Thursday -- which is a problem for MO stock:  * Altria stock actually reversed from a positive open, which changes the technical picture. Investors now have to hope that 20- and 50-day moving averages act as a support.  * The fade in recent sessions kept MO stock from challenging the high trend line of a descending broadening wedge. This is a stock that just two weeks out looked poised for a breakout through that line as it broke above moving averages. Now it's set to test support levels at $44 and then potentially $39.  * Fundamentally, this is a cheap stock that posted an earnings beat and sold off anyway. A $4.5 billion impairment charge on the Juul investment may have been partially to blame. But that impairment wasn't a surprise, given the pressures on vaping. It looks like the report simply wasn't good enough. If that's the case, MO stock lacks a catalyst until early next year. That suggests that MO stock may well stay cheap, at least in the near-term. Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Like Altria stock, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) had posted a nice bounce off the lows before a decline on Thursday. And like Altria stock, the bull run made perfect sense in the context of the chart. A multiple bottom just above $100 showed solid support. And Wynn busted through not just the 20 and 50 DMAs, but the 200 DMA.But second of our big stock charts looks a bit less bullish after Thursday's 1.9% decline and ahead of Wednesday afternoon's Q3 earnings report:  * WYNN is not far from failing to re-take the 200-day moving average, which would suggest the rally might have stalled out. So does the relatively low volume seen during the rally. If that's the case, the bullishness suggested by strong support is offset by concern that WYNN has set another lower high, creating a so-called descending triangle formulation.  * Like MO, WYNN still looks reasonably attractive from a fundamental standpoint, even if the stock isn't nearly as cheap. Admittedly, an 18x forward earnings multiple isn't that low in the context of casino operators. Rival Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) trades at a similar multiple, while Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) is modestly cheaper. The stock might not look like a steal on its face, but it's certainly cheap enough for China bulls to enter, and a 3.3% dividend yield helps the case for income-focused investors.  * Of course, Thursday's weakness highlights the problem: there simply may not be that many China bulls left. WYNN still is down 50% from 2014 peaks and has dropped almost 40% from 2018 highs. Concerns about demand (and regulation) at the company's casinos in the Chinese enclaves of Macau are a key reason why. If trade war worries are set to spike again, that could offset any good news from the Q3 report -- and in the worst-case scenario would mean that WYNN will have to test support once again. Church & Dwight (CHD)Consumer products manufacturer Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) seems to be in the eye of the beholder after a 7% decline following Q3 earnings on Thursday. That's true both fundamentally and technically:  * In terms of the chart, a longer-term uptrend has broken. But in the near term, the third of our big stock charts shows the beginning of a falling wedge, which often portends a bullish reversal. I'd note the volume in the last two months, however, which has been higher than normal during a period in which CHD has declined. That might tip the scales to a bearish interpretation.  * The fundamentals support some skepticism. Church & Dwight stock has fallen 13% since the beginning of September. But it's hardly cheap at nearly 26x 2020 consensus earnings per share estimates. Given those estimates only suggest 9% growth year-over-year, and may come down after soft guidance for the fourth quarter, there's obvious room for further multiple compression.  * But that compression might come down to investor sentiment. Larger rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has seen its valuation expand markedly over the past eighteen months. Investors have reverted from worrying about the health of the consumer packaged goods sector to seeing it as a bastion of safety. If Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), which has struggled of late, can rally after its earnings report on Friday morning, that shift may hold, and CHD can bounce back. But a sell-off in CL could mean that valuations in the space have run too far. If that's the case, CHD will have further to fall.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-11-04,"Domestic equities rallied to record highs again Monday despite some controversy at McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), one of the largest members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com On the heels of last Friday's better-than-expected October jobs report, stocks extended those gains today thanks to some encouraging signs pertaining to the U.S.-China trade saga. While the trade talks between the worlds two largest economies and the related headlines have frequently moved back and forth between positive and negative, things appear to be headed in the right direction.There's chatter that Phase 1 of a trade deal between the two sides could be signed sometime this month. Perhaps more importantly, particularly for investors with significant technology sector exposure, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said Sunday that licenses for American tech companies looking to restart selling products to Huawei Technologies could soon be on the way.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Earnings Losers That Were Hit Hard This Season That was enough to send the Nasdaq Composite higher by 0.56%, while the S&P 500 added 0.37%. The Dow Jones rose 0.42% today with 19 of its 30 members higher in late in Monday's session. Burgers, Fries And ControversyMcDonald's, which has been one of the Dow's best-performing names this year, was a problem for the blue-chip index, tumbling 2.7% after news broke Sunday that the board of the world's largest fast food chain ousted CEO Steve Easterbrook due to an allegedly consensual relationship with a female employee.In an email to McDonald's staffers, Easterbrook acknowledged the relationship and that he was in the wrong, saying &quot;I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.&quot;For now, what happened at McDonald's doesn't appear to be comparable to the 2018 controversy at Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN), one that contained scores of lurid details. However, McDonald's policy forbids executives from carrying on romantic relationships with subordinates. Global Chief People Officer David Fairhurst, head of McDonald's human resources department, also resigned in the aftermath of the Easterbrook news.MCD stock entered Monday as the fifth-largest component in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at a weight of almost 5%.Surprisingly, McDonald's was not the worst-performing member of the Dow today. That dubious distinction belongs to Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which slid nearly 4%. Interestingly, Chris Kempczinski, who is replacing Easterbrook at the helm of McDonald's, started his career at P&G, though that connection likely had no impact on the consumer products giant's Monday slump. Boeing's BackAlthough it's not all the way back in terms of price action, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is making a comeback int he Dow Jones news today. Shares of the aerospace giant and the largest member of the Dow gained 1.7%, making it one of the Dow's better performers.Today's price action in Boeing is impressive, especially if you consider analyst comments about a possible supply glut in passenger jets when Boeing is able to get the 737 MAX back in the skies. The company has continued manufacturing the 737 MAX even though it has been grounded.&quot;Next year is the challenge. When the dam breaks and the MAX starts to flow, there are going to be a lot of aircraft,&quot; said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at U.K.-based Ascend by Cirium. Building MomentumExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which reported third-quarter results last Friday, were two of three top performers in the Dow today as oil prices were supported by the U.S.-China trade news, among other factors.  * These 7 Stocks to Buy Were Big Winners This Earnings Season &quot;Along with a better-than-expected jobs report from the U.S. on Friday, those factors have combined to help lift the hope that demand for crude oil will remain healthy, amid signs of slack in economic expansion outside of the U.S.,&quot; according to MarketWatch. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayStocks continue defying skeptical prognostications and, at this point, it's hard to bet against a rally into year end. Plus, plenty of market observers likely need to boost their year end price forecasts for the S&P 500, which could be a positive catalyst.&quot;Of the 17 forecasters that CNBC tracks for S&P 500 price, just three have targets that are above where the broad-market index traded Monday. The median 3,000 target is 2.7% below mid-day levels with still nearly two months left to the year,&quot; reports CNBC.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-13,"(Bloomberg) -- In the four years since it was founded, Convoy Inc. has assembled a lineup of big-name investors that includes Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Marc Benioff. It’s adding one more to the list: Al Gore.The former U.S. vice president’s sustainability-focused investing fund, Generation Investment Management LLP, led a $400 million funding round for Convoy, which makes software to connect freight shippers with truck drivers. T. Rowe Price Group Inc. co-led the investment with Gore’s firm, Convoy said Wednesday. The deal values the startup at $2.75 billion.Convoy is often described as “Uber for trucking”—a moniker that took hold before Uber Technologies Inc. set up a competing business. Uber has committed to hire 2,000 people to expand freight operations in Chicago. Another rival business in the United Arab Emirates, Trukker, said Tuesday it received a $23 million investment led by a Saudi Arabian venture capital fund.A big part of Convoy’s pitch is that it can improve the trucking business by making it more efficient, both financially and environmentally. Transportation is the largest source of U.S. emissions today, and heavy-duty trucks represent about 13% of those emissions. Convoy’s service is designed to eliminate unnecessary driving by ensuring trucks can get loads on each trip. The business isn’t yet profitable, but Dan Lewis, the chief executive officer, has said it will be eventually.Customers include Procter & Gamble Co. and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. Among the investors in the new funding round are Alphabet Inc.’s CapitalG, Baillie Gifford, Durable Capital Partners, Fidelity Investments and Lone Pine Capital. The new funds are expected to help the company accelerate its expansion and fend off competition from upstarts, as well as the likes of J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.&#92;--With assistance from Dina Bass and Thomas Black.To contact the reporter on this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMeyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Al Gore’s Fund Leads $400 Million Deal With Trucking Startup

2019-12-02,"If you take a look at a recent chart for Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), it actually looks like what happened with the dot-coms during 2000-2001 - that is, an ugly grinding bear move. It's one of those things that seem to have no end, shaking just about everyone's confidence.Of course, with the dot-coms, there were some huge opportunities as seen with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), formerly known as Priceline.So then, with Aurora Cannabis, might we be seeing something similar? Could this be the time to make a buy? Or, could this be more like a situation of eToys or Pets.com?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWell, I'm in the optimist camp.  * 7 Entertainment Stocks to Buy to Escape Holiday Blues True, this is not to ignore the nagging problems. And yes, they are considerable. The legalization of cannabis in the Canadian market has not lived up to the lofty expectations (again, this is a parallel to the dot-com glory days). Keep in mind that governmental authorities have been agonizingly slow, especially with licensing of retail outlets. To make up for this, black market activities have become a major factor.As for Aurora Cannabis in particular, the company has had some of its own self-inflicted wounds. Let's face it: management has been too aggressive with its spending. It also looks like it has missed opportunities to strike strategic financings.However, while all these are serious problems, the markets have been factoring all this into Aurora's stock price. The result is that the market cap is a much more palatable $2.6 billion, which is not bad for a premier company in the space. Aurora's AdvantagesEven with the challenges in the Canadian market, it is still a nice source of growth. In the latest quarter, revenues for Aurora spiked by nearly 140% to $22.4 million. The company also has a decent amount of cash in the bank at $316 million.But next year there will be another catalyst for growth in the Canadian market - that is, Cannabis 2.0. This is when it will be legal to sell hemp-based edibles.Now the predictions are wide, with some estimates at over $2 billion. But even if it is half this, it should provide a nice opportunity for Aurora.The company is prepared for this, having invested in offerings like vapes, gummies, chocolates, mints, cookies and so on. There should also be help from Aurora's strategic advisor, Nelson Peltz, who is one of the world's top investors for consumer stocks. Some of his positions are in companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN).It also should be noted that Aurora is not just in the recreational cannabis space. The company actually has a diverse platform, which should help it deal better with market conditions. For example, Aurora has been able to build a strong medical business, with more than 40 researchers who have conducted a long list of clinical trials and case studies. The company currently serves about 84,000 patients and has a global platform that which reaches about 25 countries. Bottom Line on Aurora StockOn the latest earnings call, Aurora CEO Cam Battley had this to say: &quot;The past few months have been challenging for the broader cannabis industry, between issues of governance, evolving consumer demand, and provincial retail bottlenecks. There's been no shortage of negative news. That said, I want to reiterate that our view of the opportunity in the Canadian and global cannabis industry is still extremely robust.&quot;I think he is spot-on. Taking the long view of things is the way to approach companies like Aurora. This means there will continue to be lots of stomach-churning volatility. But we are still in the early days with cannabis - and more importantly, Aurora is positioned to be a winner.Tom Taulli is the author of the book, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction.

2019-12-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is officially returning to the Las Vegas CES technology conference for the first time in decades to discuss its stance on consumer privacy -- rather than pitch a new hardware product.The company’s senior director of privacy Jane Horvath will be speaking on a “Chief Privacy Officer Roundtable” on Jan. 7, according to the CES agenda.Horvath, along with executives from Facebook Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., and a commissioner from the Federal Trade Commission, will discuss how companies build privacy at scale, regulation and consumer demands.Apple’s last major official appearance at CES was in 1992 when then Chief Executive Officer John Sculley gave a presentation at a Chicago version of the summit to introduce the failed Newton device.More recently, Apple’s technology has influenced CES despite the company not officially presenting. It made news last year for a privacy billboard during the Vegas event that exclaimed, “What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.” Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. also touted Apple launching video streaming directly on third-party TVs.Each year, accessory makers fill the CES exhibit halls with cases and other peripherals for Apple devices. Behind the scenes, Apple managers roam the halls to identify future technology and scan the competitive landscape, while members of Apple’s supply chain team meet with component makers to potentially source parts for future devices.While Apple has taken a backstage approach to the conference, rivals including Google, Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. have used the event to promote their latest voice-based products, spur interest from potential partners and try to beat Apple to the punch ahead of major product announcements.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Ed Ludlow in San Francisco at eludlow2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple to Speak at CES Conference for First Time in Decades

2019-12-13,"U.S. stocks might be back on track. After choppy trading since Thanksgiving, two of the three major broad market indices reached new all-time closing highs on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sits just a tenth of a percentage point shy.Source: Shutterstock The catalyst was an apparent, if uncertain, truce in the U.S.-China trade war. And if that roadblock is cleared, there may be more upside ahead for equities. The Federal Reserve seems to have a constructive posture. The U.S. economy has slowed, but unemployment remains at record lows and consumer confidence is intact. It looks like smooth sailing heading into 2020.Friday's three big stock charts, however, focus on stocks for which the outlook is a bit more complicated. All three stocks trade at key levels, either hoping for support to hold or for resistance to give. Those hopes could be boosted if the market-wide rally continues as expected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips J.M. Smucker (SJM)Source: Provided by Finviz The first of Friday's big stock charts, J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM), isn't difficult to decipher. The key question is whether support will hold:  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz Technically, there's reason to argue that it will. $102 has held repeatedly, and looking to the weekly chart, similar levels served as resistance earlier this year. SJM consolidated at that point and began its rally to May highs.  * Fundamentally, the case is intriguing as well. I made the case for SJM stock last year, and while that case hasn't played out, the broad outline still holds. Smucker's pivot into pet food and coffee mimics a similar and well-received effort at General Mills (NYSE:GIS). Other names in the sector have rallied, with stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and McCormick (NYSE:MKC,NYSE:MKC.V) breaking out. Yet SJM stock trades at less than 13x forward earnings.  * That said, those stocks are driving solid earnings growth. J.M. Smucker isn't. FY21 consensus earnings per share estimates are modestly below fiscal 2019 levels. Full-year guidance for FY20 was cut after the fiscal second quarter report last month. There are reasons why investor patience appears to have run out.  * From a near-term standpoint, it might be other companies that determine whether support holds. Both General Mills and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) release earnings next week. Strong reports from those peers could drive optimism toward the sector and lead investors to take a longer look at one of the group's laggards. Weakness, however, could resurrect industry worries -- and lead SJM to bust through support. Ralph Lauren (RL)Source: Provided by Finviz For Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), the second of Friday's big stock charts, the situation is reversed. RL stock is trying to bust through resistance, and here too there's reason for optimism:  * Thursday's 3.7% gain puts RL in position for a breakout. An uptrend has held since August lows, and on decent volume. With the Relative Strength Index at 65, shy of overbought territory at 70, there's probably still some potential momentum behind the stock. If RL can break through resistance, there should be a path toward $122 and then early-year highs at $130.  * The rise in Ralph Lauren stock on Thursday, meanwhile, makes some sense. RL stock spiked 15% after fiscal second quarter earnings in early November handily beat Wall Street estimates. The key catalyst was strength on the Chinese mainland, where revenue increased 22% on a constant-currency basis. Good news on the trade front should help Ralph Lauren -- yet Ralph Lauren stock trades roughly where it did after the post-earnings spike.  * There are risks here on both fronts, however. Resistance has been firm going back to May. Apparel has been a brutally difficult sector. Revenue is guided to rise roughly 2% in constant currency this year; while performance on the Chinese mainland has been strong, protests in Hong Kong have hit sales in that market. At less than 14x forward earnings, RL stock is cheap, but for years now 'cheap' hasn't been enough for apparel stocks, and there's the chance that will be true for Ralph Lauren stock at these levels. UDR, Inc. (UDR)Source: Provided by Finviz Apartment operator UDR, Inc. (NYSE:UDR) already has breached support. The third of our big stock charts suggests the declines could continue, though there are some fundamental reasons for optimism:  * The fall through support is concerning from a near-term perspective. $47 is an obviously key level that held steadily as resistance this summer, and when UDR finally broke through it posted a nice breakout by REIT (real estate investment trust) standards. But the stock clearly has reversed, falling through not just $47 but all three moving averages.  * Thursday's trade news doesn't appear to be much help, either. Treasury yields moved higher on the news, limiting the relative attractiveness of UDR's current 2.95% dividend yield. The sell-off continued the weakness in UDR, which has occurred along with declines in other REITs. Widely held names like Realty Income (NYSE:O), Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), and Essex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) too have pulled back. It does seem like at some point the declines will cease, though UDR's chart suggests the reversal might not be imminent.  * That said, there are some reasons for optimism. Apartment demand is expected to rise over time. A 3% dividend yield may bring in buyers. The current descending narrowing wedge often portends a bullish reversal, and if UDR can claw back into the range it might yet see a bounce. Right now, however, UDR is looking for buyers.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-12-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- He’s making a list and checking it twice, but can’t find a takeover target that’s nice.Warren Buffett is the jolly man of the stock market. However, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has also been a bit of a Scrooge this year, as he continues to pass up acquisitions and instead hoard his money. The billionaire has long been seeking a really big deal on which to spend some of his company’s $128 billion of cash, except everything is overpriced in his view. To make matters more frustrating, Berkshire’s own shares are lagging behind the broader U.S. market by the most since 2009.While 2019 wasn’t Buffett’s worst year, it was surely one of his dullest. With Berkshire’s cash pile reaching new heights, Buffett has said that just the thought of taking over another company — he’s acquired nearly 200 during his career — causes his heart “to beat faster.” Instead, this chart of Berkshire’s stock performance looks like it’s almost flat-lining:Berkshire shares are on track to end the year up a modest 11%, trailing the S&P 500 index by 20 percentage points. That’s even as the company posted record operating profit in the latest quarter.Buffett, who turned 89 in August, is the fourth-richest person in the world, and it’s hard for the fourth-richest person in the world to have too bad of a year. But for one of the most celebrated investors and dealmakers of all time, who also enjoys basking in the spotlight, the deal dry spell isn’t much fun. Without any new acquisitions to rave about, even Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letters — the release of which investors treat like tickets dropping for a Beyonce concert — lately have been shorter than usual and have lacked his characteristic bawdy metaphors. (That’s not to say a retreat from the dirty-grandpa humor isn’t welcomed by this writer.)Berkshire’s last large takeover — the kind he dubs “elephants” — was Precision Castparts, an aerospace-parts supplier, for $37 billion; it was completed nearly four years ago. This year, Berkshire merely provided $10 billion of high-interest financing to help another company, Occidental Petroleum Corp., make an acquisition; that barely put a dent in Berkshire’s cash. It was then outbid in November for software distributor Tech Data Corp. in what would have been a $5 billion deal.(1) Berkshire had considered selling debt in Europe, which might have been a precursor to a significant acquisition overseas, but that never panned out. At the end of the day, the company’s splashiest investment of the year was an $861 million stake in Amazon.com Inc. The closest thing Buffett found to an elephant might just be this stuffed animal, an item sold at RH, a small home-furnishings retailer in which Berkshire recently bought a stake.Though it was a boring year, 2019 marks the end of what was perhaps Berkshire’s most transformative decade. It became the owner of one of America’s most expansive railroad systems, BNSF, while recognizable brands including Duracell and Kraft Heinz (for better or worse) also joined the Berkshire family. At the start of the decade, consumer stocks such as Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. accounted for the biggest share of Berkshire’s stock-market holdings. Now, Apple Inc. and some banks and credit-card companies together comprise almost three-quarters of its portfolio. Buffett also took meaningful steps toward succession planning by promoting Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to oversee all Berkshire’s operations and thus raising their public profiles. Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger — who turns 96 on New Year’s Day — were asked during the last shareholder meeting in May whether their successors will have to transition the company from an acquisition-and-investment vehicle into an entity focused instead on returning capital through stock buybacks and dividends. “That’s certainly a possibility,” maybe even during his time, Buffett said. “But we will have to see how that works out over many years, because certain years huge opportunities present themselves and other years are totally dry holes.” Berkshire spent about $2.8 billion repurchasing class A and B shares in the first nine months of 2019, up from $0 in 2017.U.S. stocks haven’t been getting any cheaper for Buffett. That said, some see his hoarding of cash partly as an insurance policy in case his health deteriorates, so that there’s added financial flexibility for the next CEO. But knowing Buffett, he’ll want to go out with a bang. Finding one last elephant should be his New Year’s resolution. (1) Buffett was also close to doing a “very large” transaction around this time last year, but it fell apart, as did attempted deals involving Unilever Plc and Oncor Electric Delivery Co. in 2017.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

The bull market almost certainly will enter its twelfth year in March (though by some measures, it ended, however briefly, in December 2018). The S&P 500 rose 29% in 2019 alone; the NASDAQ Composite performed even better. Equities are at all-time highs, and valuation multiples seem much the same.Source: Shutterstock Friday's big stock charts focus on three stocks for which the key question is similar to that of the market as a whole. These aren't necessarily stocks that have led, or in two cases even joined, the broader rally. But all three closed 2019 on a high note and in an uptrend.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers As a result, for these names investors can wonder how much of a rally remains. In all three cases, near-term trading could set the tone for the remainder of 2020. And in all three cases, these big stock charts suggest at least some reason for caution.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Provided by Finviz Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was one of the most impressive stocks of 2019. The 36% rise in PG stock perhaps doesn't seem that spectacular relative to the 29% increase in the S&P 500 or even the 22% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which PG is a component. But in context, the move is close to extraordinary.After all, PG is a mega-cap and defensive name. Both characteristics suggest the stock should underperform in a bull market. CPG (consumer packaged goods) stocks as a whole posted smaller returns than the market, yet P&G stock outperformed pretty much every peer. At the same time, the stock managed to reverse a long-stagnant trend: shares gained less than 1% total in the previous four years.With all that backward-looking good news, however, the first of Friday's stock charts suggests a more muted view looking forward:  * PG stock simply has stalled out. Resistance held at $125 in September and October, while a move above those levels last month quickly faded. Shares now are challenging the support line of the multi-month uptrend, and the 50-day moving average after falling through the 20DMA. This looks like a stock ready to roll over, with the next level of support at $120 followed by the 200-day around $115.  * Fundamentally, there's a case for a modest decline as well. After a decade marked by cost-cutting, reorganization, and divestitures, P&G found the recipe for growth in fiscal 2019 (ending June). But there's simply not much left in the way of catalysts. This now is a company likely to post mid-single-digit net profit growth whose stock trades at 25x the FY20 consensus earnings per share estimate. That's a potentially dicey combination, particularly given that historically PG received at most a P/E multiple in the low 20s.  * With third quarter earnings due toward the end of this month, there is a potential downside catalyst if results disappoint. Rival Unilever (NYSE:UL,NYSE:UN) delivered a warning on demand in key regions last month. P&G's own second quarter report in late October was not well-received.  * It's possible the market, as it has in recent years, keeps bidding up names it views as quality. But there's a strong case that at the least, the performance of PG stock this year will be much less impressive than it was in 2019. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Source: Provided by Finviz Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) seems to have found its footing. Shares have bounced about 20% since hitting a six-year low in late August. A cheap valuation, takeover speculation and better results across the sector have contributed.The question looking to 2020 is if the uptrend can hold. Both the second of our big stock charts and fundamental analysis suggest that it should:  * The technical picture still looks reasonably solid after the rally over the past two weeks. WBA stock saw a &quot;golden cross&quot; in November, as the 50DMA crossed above the 200DMA. That pattern didn't have much of an immediate effect, as shares kept falling. But with a bottom seemingly in, and WBA riding the 50-day in recent sessions, the longer-term uptrend seems confirmed at the moment.  * Fundamentally, WBA is one of the Dow Jones' cheapest stocks, at less than 10x forward earnings. Rivals Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) have shown signs of life after their recent earnings reports, with leveraged RAD stock in particular soaring. Walgreens earnings on Wednesday look like a potential catalyst.  * That earnings report, however, presents a risk on both fronts. A sell-off next week would breach the uptrend established since late August. Shares probably would need to rely on the 200DMA for support. And with rivals doing better, a weak report might suggest that Walgreens has execution issues in addition to the margin and sales problems that have pressured the industry in recent years.  * I wrote this week that Walgreens was one of the 2019's losers that likely would be a winner in 2020. I still believe that will be the case. But for that to happen, Walgreens earnings next week need to set a bullish tone. Harley-Davidson (HOG)Source: Provided by Finviz Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) managed to put in a bottom in late August. An eight-year low proved the nadir of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, and a gap up after third quarter earnings allowed the stock to re-test resistance above $40.Since that test failed, however, HOG stock has struggled. And the third of Friday's big stock charts suggests more downside ahead:  * Shares have exited out of an uptrend established from August lows (which actually is a slightly narrowing ascending wedge). They've breached the 50-day moving average as well after a golden cross formed in early November. The 200-day moving average at $36 is the next key level. Below $36, support looks limited, and there's a technical argument for a potentially severe sell-off.  *   Click to Enlarge Source: Provided by Finviz Looking to the monthly chart, the broader trend becomes apparent. And the rally of late looks like an almost parabolic move against that primary trend -- a move that usually reverses. For now, the gains in recent months look more like a &quot;dead cat bounce&quot; than a sustainable reversal.  * Fundamentally, HOG stock looks worrisome as well. Shares are cheap at less than 11x next year's consensus EPS estimate. Progress on the trade war front should help the company. But profits are heading in the wrong direction, and rival Polaris Industries (NYSE:PII) is taking share with its Indian Motorcycles nameplate. Demographics hardly seem to favor Harley-Davidson, either. Both the fundamentals and the third of our big stock charts make HOG stock look more like a value trap than a value play. That in turn suggests investors should look elsewhere for returns in 2020.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2020-01-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s top privacy executive defended the company’s use of encryption after recent clashes with law enforcement and politicians over access to information locked on iPhones.IPhones are prone to be lost or stolen, so Apple needs to make sure the devices are encrypted to protect data such as health and payment information, Senior Director of Global Privacy Jane Horvath said during a panel discussion at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas.She also called terrorism and child sexual abuse “abhorrent” and stressed that Apple helps law enforcement with investigations every day.The FBI recently asked Apple to help it access information on iPhones belonging to an alleged gunman who killed three people at a Florida naval base last month. The gunman is dead and the handsets are locked by a password and encrypted, so federal investigators can’t get the device data.“When the FBI requested information from us relating to this case a month ago we gave them all of the data in our possession and we will continue to support them with the data we have available,” Apple said in a statement on Tuesday.Apple regularly responds to warrants by giving investigators access to data that is stored on its servers, such as users’ iCloud account information. However, the company has refused in the past to help authorities unlock iPhones to get on-device data. It has also argued that iPhone security and encryption mean that it can’t access such information even if it wanted to.Tech companies and governments have clashed for years over balancing law enforcement access and user privacy, most famously when the U.S. sought access to an iPhone from a terrorist who carried out a deadly shooting spree in San Bernardino, California, in 2015. Apple refused to help, and the FBI eventually was able to hack into the handset. Discussions and debate have continued with little progress.Apple, Facebook Clash With Senators Over Encryption, BackdoorsApple has used privacy as a key differentiator, consistently pushing the message that its hardware and services are more secure than competitors. At CES, Horvath described the ways Apple minimizes data collection, or gathers information that is not tied to specific users. She cited Siri pulling up weather data for person’s city, not their exact latitude and longitude.Horvath also said Apple puts a privacy engineer and a lawyer on each team developing new devices.She was joined on the panel by Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, Susan Shook, Procter & Gamble Co.’s global privacy officer, and Rebecca Slaughter, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. Apple often appears on panels to discuss its privacy policies, but this is the first time in decades that that company has had an official presence at CES.Egan said Facebook has “a different business model than Apple, but both business models are privacy protected.” Some hardware running Facebook software, including Oculus virtual reality headsets, process data on device, Egan added. But she said that many Facebook features around sharing require cloud-based processing.Egan also said Facebook only collects information it needs to operating its services and work with advertisers. User privacy is protected on Facebook, Egan said. Slaughter, the FTC Commissioner, disputed that assertion.(Updates with Facebook comments in final two paragraphs.)To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Gurman in Los Angeles at mgurman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Privacy Executive Defends Encryption After FBI Request

2020-01-10,"Equities backed off record highs Friday after the December employment report proved to be a dud, showing the addition of just 145,000 new roles in the final month of 2019, well below the 160,000 new jobs economists were expecting. Unemployment remained at 3.5%.Source: Charts Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 lost 0.29%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched lower by 0.46%  * The Nasdaq Composite retreated by 0.27%  * On a day that should have favored defensive fare, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) paced the Dow with a gain of 1.41%In addition to the jobs number missing estimates and the already low jobless rate holding steady, wages rose just 2.9% last month, below the 3.1% economists expected. In better news, the broader unemployment rate, the one that includes discouraged workers and the underemployed, fell to 6.7%.The October and November numbers were revised slightly lower, adding to the headwinds for riskier assets today. All that taken into account, declines for the major averages to close the week were palatable, though just nine of the Dow's 30 members were in the green in late trading.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pfizer the FantasticAmong the five largest domestic pharmaceuticals stocks, Pfizer was the biggest dog in 2019, but every dog has its day, eventually. That moment could be arriving for Pfizer.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week Upon shedding its generic drugs unit view the Mylan (NYSE:MYL) transaction announced last year, Pfizer is &quot;set to emerge is a best-in-class growth story on [its] smaller, more innovative base,&quot; RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky said in a recent note.On Thursday, Pfizer reached a deal with eFFECTOR Therapeutics calling for a $15 million upfront payment and up to $492 million down the road that gives Pfizer some exposure to the elusive eIF4E market; eIF4E is found in a range of cancers.Effector has zotatifin, an eIF4A inhibitor, that is in clinical trials for testing in solid tumors. Bad News DuoIn late trading, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) were tussling for the dubious distinction of being the Dow's worst-performing name today. In the case of Travelers, the Friday malaise is easy to explain as the stock was downgraded by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods to &quot;underperform&quot; from &quot;market weight.&quot; The research also lowered its price target on Travelers to $125 from $144. That new target is below the $135 area at which the stock closed today.Predictably, Boeing's woes today are a bit more complex. Suffice to say company documents revealing that employees described the controversial 737 MAX jet as &quot;designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys&quot; and that the now grounded passenger plane was subject to &quot;piss poor design&quot; didn't help Boeing stock today.Those communications are dated April 2017, but despite the age, those comments call into question Boeing's ability to get the 737 MAX back in the skies.&quot;We regret the content of these communications, and apologize to the [Federal Aviation Administration], Congress, our airline customers, and to the flying public for them,&quot; the company said. Defensive DueAs noted above, today was the type of day when investors favored defensive names, providing some follow through on Thursday's gains by Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Today's upside for those staples giants was modest, but it was enough to place the stocks among the Dow winners, a small group on Friday to be sure.  * 10 Stocks That Every 30-Year-Old Should Buy and Hold Forever  Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThe big banks start reporting earnings next week, meaning fourth-quarter earnings season is upon us.

2020-01-17,"Editor's note: InvestorPlace's Earnings Reports to Watch is updated weekly. Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Earnings season begins next week. And it's obviously an important stretch for the market. Broad indices are trading at new all-time highs on Thursday, which suggests expectations are reasonably elevated as the earnings calendar picks up.Meanwhile, many companies that report on a calendar-year basis will deliver not only fourth-quarter results, but guidance for 2020. In a market already pricing in a strong year, disappointing outlooks would undercut investor confidence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo earnings reports next week will be closely watched, ahead of an bigger slate the following week. And it's difficult to predict exactly how those reports will be received. After all, the last reasonably significant decline in U.S. stocks began at the start of earnings season in late July. Three months later, third-quarter earnings reports catalyzed the year-end rally.This stretch of the earnings calendar thus seems like a rubber match. And it begins with an interesting group of earnings reports next week across sectors and across the value/growth continuum.The airline sector, which underpins my pick for the Best ETF of 2020, sees reports from the likes of American Airlines (NYSE:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) after a strong report from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) this week.That key sector should highlight consumer confidence, as should apparel play VF Corporation (NYSE:VFC). Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) kicks off earnings from the currently hot semiconductor space.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills But these seven earnings reports look like the most important next week. They include some big names in some important sectors, whose results could signal how the rest of earnings season will play out. Earnings Reports to Watch: International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, January 21, after market closeFor International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Q4 earnings likely will come down to guidance and Red Hat. IBM stock has been rangebound for over four years now, and still trades about one-third below 2013 highs. A lack of growth has been the key reason why.The Red Hat acquisition is supposed to change that, and make IBM a more legitimate player in the cloud. It's still early in the integration of that deal, which only closed in July, but investors will be looking to the 2020 outlook for a key data point in terms of early performance.The concern ahead of Tuesday's release is that the need for growth is nothing new. Third-quarter results in October were similarly important, yet IBM's revenue disappointed and IBM stock fell on the release.As a result, IBM firmly is a &quot;show me&quot; story at this point. It will take both a strong quarter and a positive outlook to change that, and drive IBM stock out of its rangebound ways. Netflix (NFLX)Source: vesperstock / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, January 21, after market closeFourth quarter earnings from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) likely will have the broadest impact of any release next week.To be sure, Netflix's numbers obviously will matter to NFLX stock itself. Options markets at the moment are pricing in a nearly 8% move by the end of next week. Netflix's subscriber numbers have been soft on occasion, most notably in the second quarter and the figure will be closely watched. With competition ramping, Netflix likely has even less room for error than it has in the past.But that competition means the results will matter to other names as well. The &quot;streaming wars&quot; are ramping up. Disney (NYSE:DIS) already has disclosed strong subscriber numbers for its Disney+ service. AT&T (NYSE:T) and others have their own services on the way. Tuesday's release could show whether Netflix has an insurmountable lead -- or whether its rivals have a legitimate opportunity to take market share.  * 10 Cheap Stocks to Buy Under $10 Even outside the sector, the report will matter, given that NFLX is one of the largest and most well-covered stocks in the market. Does NFLX catch a bid after a strong quarter? Or are we, as some fear, at a point where valuations are simply too stretched, particularly among high-flyers? Investors should watch post-earnings trading in NFLX closely, because it could signal the broader sentiment towards valuation and growth at this point in the bull market. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, January 22, before market openFor Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the goal on Wednesday morning is pretty simple: no surprises. JNJ stock has rallied nicely in recent weeks, as the company seems to have put its myriad legal and regulatory issues in the rear-view mirror, at least for now.To keep the rally going, J&J likely needs to provide an earnings beat, which shouldn't be terribly difficult: The company has topped Street expectations on both lines for nine consecutive quarters. And it needs to avoid any new disclosures about additional liabilities or earnings accruals relative to its legal exposure.That combination should be enough. JNJ stock still is reasonably cheap, at just 16x forward earnings. A 2.6% dividend yield is attractive in an environment where the 10-year Treasury offers just 1.8%. Getting back toward normal has been unquestionably good news for JNJ stock; now, the company just needs to keep it that way. Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Wednesday, January 22, before market openAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an interesting name to watch next week. Despite the market rally, ABT stock has been surprisingly stuck, with resistance holding just below $90 going back to this summer. Heading into Wednesday morning's release, shares are nearing that resistance again, setting up an interesting report.A solid gain after earnings could set up a technical breakout. Any weakness, however, and resistance gets even firmer. ABT stock obviously is unlikely to soar or plunge following the report, but post-earnings trading in the stock likely sets its near-term direction.  * 7 5G Stocks to Connect Your Portfolio To But as with Netflix, here too the reaction to earnings will be interesting. The valuations assigned growth stocks like NFLX have garnered much of the headlines. But at 24x forward earnings, ABT is one of many &quot;safe&quot; stocks receiving historically high multiples. Are investors willing to pay those multiples -- or something even higher -- for anything less than a perfect quarter? Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, January 23, before market openThat same question applies to consumer giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). To be sure, the huge rally in PG stock, which has risen 80% in less than two years, makes some sense. A long-running turnaround effort finally has gained traction and driven earnings growth.But at the same 24x forward multiple as ABT, PG stock has a historically high valuation. The last time shares garnered anything close to 24x was in the early to mid-2000's, when P&G's international opportunity was far newer and far larger.As a result, P&G seemingly has little room for error on Thursday morning. And its trading could read across to peers like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), as well as the likes of Abbott Labs and even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In this bull market, investors have steadily paid higher and higher prices not just for growth, but for quality. It's fair to wonder if and when that ends. Comcast (CMCSA)Source: Todd A. Merport / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, January 23, before market openThe question for Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) at the moment is: can it catch up? That's true for CMCSA stock, which has mostly lagged both the broader markets and particularly peer Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR). And it's true for the company's Peacock streaming service, which launches in April.As far as CMCSA stock goes, the key figure to watch might be video subscribers. &quot;Cord-cutting&quot; clearly accelerated in 2019. Faster erosion of that subscriber base won't impact just Comcast stock, but suppliers like AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) and Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA).The other key area to watch will be on the content side. NBCUniversal, whose intellectual property underpins Peacock, too is struggling with cord-cutting. Valuations assigned the likes of AMCX and DISCA show that investors are pricing in steady declines in revenue and profits for media companies.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Are Not Worth a Second Glance A poor report from Comcast would amplify cord-cutting concerns for both the distribution and content businesses, particularly if Netflix's U.S. subscriber numbers impress. With Comcast stock near all-time highs, the streaming launch still three months away, and Netflix earnings on Tuesday, it's easy to see a bearish narrative emerging next week. Comcast doesn't need a perfect quarter, but it does need to avoid the perfect storm. Intel (INTC)Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, January 23, after market closeTexas Instruments does have the first of the chip sector's earnings reports next week with its Q4 release on Wednesday afternoon. But Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has the most important. Like many semiconductor stocks, INTC has rallied nicely in recent months. And investors may discount TXN earnings to some extent, given that company's soft guidance in October proved to be an outlier in the industry.Intel's report on Thursday is likely to move the sector. The question is in which direction. Again, many chip plays have gained, with higher-growth names like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) soaring. The narrative among investors clearly has returned to a focus on future drivers like 5G, automotive and cloud over near-term cyclical worries.The mission for Intel is to keep that narrative intact. Weak demand among cloud providers hit the sector early last year, and that end market no doubt will be the point of focus on Intel's Q4 conference call. First quarter guidance will be key as well.As with many companies in this bull market, it's probably enough for Intel to simply not give investors a reason to sell. If the company does, however, that selling pressure likely will spread to the rest of its industry, at least in regular trading on Friday.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Over night, the Chinese government quarantined the city of Wuhan, a metropolitan area with the population of New York and Chicago combined. Travel authorities in Macau scrapped plans for the Chinese Lunar New Year celebration. However, stocks were able to muster some momentum late in the session and close well off the lows of the day.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 eked out a gain of 0.11%  * The Dow Jones finished lower by 0.09%  * The Nasdaq Composite added 0.20%  * In the &quot;you don't see this everyday&quot; category, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was among the Dow's best-performing names today, jumping 2.8%Over the course of this week, I've been highlighting various earnings reports from Dow components and pointing today as a particularly busy day on that front. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was among the Dow's dogs, but not to be outdone, Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) tumbled 5% after its earnings report. That easily made the insurance company the worst-performing name in the Dow Jones today.Not to diminish the importance of Procter & Gamble and Travelers, but they aren't the biggest names in the Dow and the blue-chip index was able to mitigate losses due to contributions from Boeing and some of its other larger components, including some tech stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn late trading, 13 of the 30 Dow members were in the green. Boeing: Believe ItBoeing has been an easy mark for negative commentary in recent months and the company is to blame for that. However, for one day at least, the stock got going in the right direction. Boeing CEO David Calhoun still has plenty of work to do to restore airlines' and employees' confidence -- it's going to be a long road on both fronts -- but it appears the new CEO is at least being forthright about where the company is at today.  * 7 Healthcare Stocks With 100% Street Support In comments out Wednesday, Calhoun said there isn't a chance that the 737 Max passenger will never fly again.&quot;Even the [Federal Aviation Administration] has a lot of confidence in this airplane,&quot; he said.He expects production of the controversial jet will restart over the next couple of months, but efforts to get the plane in the sky again revolve around the FAA making that call and pilots regaining faith in the safety of the plane. Microsoft on the Prowl?Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hasn't been mentioned here in a bit, but there's good reason to change that today and not just because the stock was among the Dow winners.As is often noted in relation to Microsoft, through its Azure unit, the company is increasingly a dominant force in the cloud computing market. To Microsoft's credit, much of Azure's rapid growth has been organic, but sometimes bolt-on acquisitions help, too.In a note to clients today, Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin highlighted a slew of companies Microsoft could acquire to bolster its cloud unit. It's speculative at this point, but all of the ideas with the exception of one would be easily digestable for Microsoft. More EarningsIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) reports earnings today after the close. Given how much the stock has run up in recent days coupled with the tepid reaction to Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) fourth-quarter results, some caution with Intel may be warranted over the near-term though the stock was one of the better Dow performers today.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy American Express (NYSE:AXP) nudged higher today in advance of its fourth-quarter report Friday before the bell. Analysts expect the credit card company to earn $2.01 a share on revenue of $11.37 billion for the December quarter, compared with earnings of $2.32 on revenue of $10.47 billion last year.

2020-01-24,"The shares of consumer packaged goods giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) dipped slightly recently after the company reported mixed second-quarter numbers. Its profits topped analysts' average expectations, its gross margins expanded, and PG increased its full-year sales and profit guidance. But PG's organic volume and sales growth slowed versus Q1, its expense/revenue ratio rose year-over-year, and the growth of its operating margin slowed versus Q1. PG's results were mixed, but PG stock was priced for perfect earnings.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com PG now carries very real valuation risks, since its shares are about as richly priced as they've ever been. Sure, PG deserves a higher-than-average valuation due to its higher-than-average growth and low interest rates. So as long as Procter & Gamble continues to generate higher-than-average growth and interest rates remain low, PG stock can grind higher.But I'd be careful with PG for two reasons. First, the company's growth is slowing, and history indicates that this trend will continue. Secondly, even if the company's growth doesn't keep slowing, PG stock is fully valued, so any further gains by the shares will probably be limited in the near-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Procter & Gamble's Big Red FlagsThere were two big red flags in Procter & Gamble's Q2 results.Specifically, its volume growth, excluding acquisitions, fell from 4% in Q1 to 3% in Q2, and its sales growth, excluding acquisitions, dropped from 7% in Q1 to 5% in Q2.Even more alarming, this is the first time Procter & Gamble's sales growth, excluding acquisitions, has dropped versus the previous quarter in two years.  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy Thus, it appears that Procter & Gamble's growth is slowing for the first time in a long time.That seems to run counter to macroeconomic fundamentals. After all, global labor markets remain healthy, while monetary policies are becoming more and more supportive and trade tensions are easing.But it pays to remember that, throughout the last decade, Procter & Gamble's sales growth, excluding acquisitions, rose by an average of 3%. Between 2010 and 2018, the company's sales growth, excluding acquisitions, never came in above 5%. Thus, the last few quarters in which Procter & Gamble's top-line growth, ex. acquisitions, has been 5% to 7%, have been unusual.Given that the demand for Procter & Gamble's flagship household and beauty products is usually steady, its exceptionally high sales growth probably won't continue. Instead, it is far more likely that the company's growth will return to a more normal level of roughly 3%.PG's Q2 numbers suggest that this slowdown has begun. If that's the case, PG stock could be in trouble. Procter & Gamble Won't Rise Much FurtherA growth slowdown could spell big trouble for Procter & Gamble because its shares are not priced for a slowdown.Specifically, Procter & Gamble's present valuation is way above average. The stock is trading for 25 times analysts' average 2020 earnings per share estimate. (In other words, the shares are trading at a forward P/E multiple of 25.)  Over the last five years, the average forward P/E multiple of PG stock is 21. Going back to 2010, the average forward P/E multiple of PG stock is closer to 15. Excluding 2019, the highest forward P/E multiple of the shares in the 2010s was about 22.The shares' valuation is high mostly because, as mentioned earlier, Procter & Gamble has been growing at the fastest rate in a long time. Over the past four quarters, its sales growth, excluding acquisitions, has been 5% and up, whereas from 2010 to 2018, they were stubbornly below 5%.But if this high-growth era comes to an end, the high multiples of  the shares could also be over. And, with sales trends slowing for the first time in two years and tough growth comparisons on the horizon, it increasingly appears that Procter & Gamble's era of 5% and higher sales growth is over.As this high-growth chapter comes to a close, the forward P/E multiple of PG stock will likely decline from today's elevated 25 level to a level closer to 20. That means that PG poses meaningful risks. The Bottom Line on PG StockProcter & Gamble is a good company. But its shares are priced for perfection, and the high-growth streak which Procter & Gamble has been on for several quarters will end in 2020. As it does, the high P/E ratio of PG will gradually drop, keeping the shares from trending much higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-24,"Shareholder friendly.Those two words sum up income stocks. It means these stocks have decided to take some of their net income and deliver it back shareholders on a regular basis.It means their businesses aren't run for the most growth, but for steady long-term wealth accumulation. Yes, the stocks rise and the companies grow, but some of that cash for expansion is returned to shareholders on a regular basis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome industries are famous for their income -- real estate investment trusts, utilities, master limited partnerships. But usually, mature companies where explosive growth is no longer the driving force, are the most solid dividend payers. At my Growth Investor service, we own a stable of these companies in our Elite Dividend Payers portfolio.Here, while my Portfolio Grader found plenty of &quot;A&quot;-rated dividend stocks, I wanted to pick stocks that also delivered reliable dividends that would beat inflation as well.  * Invest in America's Most Trusted Brands With These 7 Stocks to Buy These seven &quot;A&quot;-rated dividend stocks to depend on all fit that bill except one, where growth is just too tempting to pass up, so its yield is a little light. Dividend Stocks to Buy: Southern Company (SO)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.6%Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is the second largest utility in the U.S. It runs the power companies for Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama. It also has extensive natural gas operations up and down the East Coast.It's the only utility in the U.S. that is building a new nuclear facility. Then its project management partner and nuke builder Westinghouse went bankrupt. That meant Southern had to take over the entire project.And it has done well. While the completion date has been pushed to 2021 or 2022, things are moving along on schedule.On the growth side, its massive natural gas distribution business as well as its renewable energy business are doing very well. And it's one of the best-run utilities out there.With a 3.6% dividend and 12-month return of 46%, SO stock is a rock-solid pick for any portfolio. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 2.4%Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has been in business since 1837.Wrap your head around that. It has been around for more than 150 years. Martin Van Buren was president when PG launched in Ohio. J. P. Morgan was born that year. There were still border wars with First Nation tribes.When you have been around that long, it means you're doing something right from the boardroom down to the products.Now, there have been some challenges of late, as new generations of less brand-conscious consumers have hit the markets and PG had to readjust its product portfolio.But it is finally through that transition. PG has raised its dividend every year for the past 60 years. That is an accomplishment few stocks can make. And it's that kind of focus on shareholder value that makes this unique.  * The 7 Stocks That Cautious Investors Should Sell Now The 2.4% dividend may not be huge, but it's consistent. And its 33% stock gain in the last year is also a nice kicker. However, if you do also want growth in your portfolio, there are better places to find it going forward. Equity Residential (EQR)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.7%Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) is a Chicago-based real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in upscale apartments in some of the top cities in the U.S. You can find its properties in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Seattle and more.In these types of cities, many people that work for big firms receive relocation allowances to find a place to live until they can settle in. Some firms even lease apartments and allow their employees to use them if they're in town on long-term assignments.That makes these cities' real estate needs unique. And that is a good thing for a niche player like EQR. It can keep its occupancy rate high, as well as its rates, because it offers top locations and quality accommodations in strategic cities.Now that prices in many of these cities have become incredibly expensive, renting has also become a real option for residents that want, and can afford, the convenience of downtown locations.The stock is up 18% in the past year and has a solid 2.7% dividend. Dominion Energy (D)Source: ying / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 4.4%Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) is one of the leading utilities in the country. It can stretch its roots back to 1795, but in its most recognizable form, it's been around for a century.It supplies electrical power to Virginia (which is part of the internet backbone, houses the Pentagon and one of the largest shipbuilding plants in the world) and also has an extensive natural gas production and distribution network that covers the Eastern seaboard and beyond.Dominion also has a number of wholesale power generation plants that extend into the Midwest.Its Cove Point plant in Maryland is being converted from a natural gas import hub to an export port for liquified natural gas (LNG). It will be one of the few on the East Coast and will see a significant rise in business as export restrictions on LNG fall.

And that's a good thing for an income stock. In the past year Dominion stock was up 21%, and it continues to deliver a rock-solid dividend, now yielding 4.4%. Leidos (LDOS)Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 1.3%Leidos (NYSE:LDOS) isn't throwing off a staggering dividend yield, at 1.3%. But this is a growing, dynamic company that is well positioned for the future of defense and security in the U.S. and beyond.It has a storied history that stretches back to 1969. And it has been a private contracting institution since its early days. It has worked on some of the biggest scientific challenges the U.S. government has come up against in the past 50 years.And now, it is focused on aerospace technologies. A recent $1.7 billion merger with aerospace firm Dynetics was announced just a month ago.This put LDOS in prime position for all the space work that is heating up both on the government side -- the Space Force -- and the private side -- the big defense contractors that build the equipment for the government.As a smaller player in the aerospace and defense sector, it can leverage its growth because it is more concentrated.But given the fact that all the major industrial powers now have active aerospace programs, this is the next frontier. And LDOS is already a reliable partner.And while the dividend isn't a big driver, the fact the stock is up 80% in the past year yet sits at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22 means that growth is just beginning. Carlyle Group (CG)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Dividend Yield: 3.6%Carlyle Group (NASDAQ:CG) is one of my favorite companies when it comes to foundational stocks that deliver solid dividends.It's a private equity firm that continues to draw exclusive clients from the corridors of power around the world. The kind of people and families that make decisions that make business happen.You know, royal families from the Middle East. Political dynasties in the U.S. World leaders from around the globe.But CG has always been discreet. It does deals, makes its money, disburses it to shareholders and keeps a low profile in a business that is often just as much about headlines as assets under management. It's the kind of business that deserves consideration for any Growth Investor.It's a steady hitter, not a swing for the fences kind of operation.  * The 10 Best Value Stocks to Own in 2020 But it certainly delivers for shareholders. In the past 12 months, CG stock was up a stunning 95%, yet it continues to deliver a bountiful 3.6% dividend. And it has done all this with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of … 12. PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (PMT)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 8.1%PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE:PMT) is one of my favorite stocks now because it's well positioned for all the good things happening in today's economy.With interest rates low, a solid economy, low unemployment and confident consumers, the housing market is well positioned for strong growth.PennyMac is a great way to play this trend.It doesn't own properties, it manages the mortgages of residential properties. It originates them, manages them, bundles them and resells them.Plus, it's set up as REIT, which means it is obligated to pay its net income back to shareholders, and it chooses to do that via its hefty dividend of 8.1%. Plus, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act now allows REIT investors to deduct 20% of their dividend. Then, the remainder is taxed at the shareholder's marginal rate. Check with your tax professional for more details.The stock is up a solid 19% in the past year and it still trades at a single-digit P/E.That being said, in the big picture, there's been a major development in the technology field I'm especially keen on now: artificial intelligence (AI) The AI Master KeyIf artificial intelligence sounds futuristic, even far-fetched -- well, keep in mind, you're already using it every day.

2020-02-10,"(Bloomberg) -- Edgewell Personal Care Co. is ditching its bid to acquire shaving-supply maker Harry’s -- and the broader takeaway is that big consumer companies may have to think twice before snapping up feisty upstarts that are nibbling away at their market share.The company said it’s abandoning the proposed $1.37 billion deal a week after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds. Its shares climbed as much as 27% on Monday -- the most on record -- after the announcement, which accompanied quarterly earnings, cheered on by investors who felt the company was overpaying.Edgewell had planned to reinvigorate its Schick razor line by putting Harry’s co-founders, Jeff Raider and Andy Katz-Mayfield, in charge. Now it will have to formulate a new path forward for the 100-year-old brand.On a call Monday, Chief Executive Officer Rod Little said the company remains “energized” in its mission to turn Schick around, but acknowledged that “it’s going to take us longer to get there” without the injection of expertise from Harry’s, which was a pioneer of the direct-to-consumer subscription model for shaving goods.The FTC lawsuit could complicate future deals by big consumer-goods companies that hold sway in certain industries and want to grow via acquisitions. The FTC’s opposition to the deal may be a bad sign for Juul Labs Inc., the e-cigarette company whose sale of a stake to an established rival -- Marlboro maker Altria Inc. -- is still under review by the agency.Other companies that roiled their industries in Harry’s-like fashion are seeing valuations plummet. Casper Sleep Inc., the mattress-in-the-mail maker that went public this month, fell as much as 9.5% in trading Monday, valuing the company at just over $400 million.Acquiring EarlyThe lesson may be to acquire young, potentially disruptive startups before they get too big. Harry’s had gained market share behind Procter & Gamble Co. and Edgewell, and the FTC couldn’t allow consolidation at that level, said Peter Carstensen, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who specializes in antitrust matters.Further consolidation by one of the biggest players in a market with few competitors “is not going to be allowed,” he said. “This merger was not going to do anybody any good, probably not even the shareholders.”Last week’s FTC complaint said that Harry’s was a “uniquely disruptive competitor” in the shaving market that “forced its rivals to offer lower prices, and more options, to consumers across the country.”Other DealsP&G last month agreed to buy Billie, which makes shaving products for women and the company has made a series of similar acquisitions in recent years. Unilever purchased Dollar Shave Club in 2016.“We believe we would have prevailed in litigation, and are disappointed by the decision by Edgewell’s board not to see this process to its conclusion,” Raider and Katz-Mayfield said in a statement, adding they were “perplexed” by the FTC action.The Harry’s deal stands out because of its size, with Harry’s and Edgewell trailing only P&G in U.S. shaving market share, according to Carstensen.“This merger was so far over the line that it was a no-brainer,” he said.To contact the reporter on this story: Gerald Porter Jr. in New York at gporter30@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sally Bakewell at sbakewell1@bloomberg.net, Jonathan RoederFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Derailed Harry’s Deal Is a Warning Shot to Startup Buyers
2020-02-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Harry's Inc. billed itself as an alternative to overpriced razors, and the sales pitch worked — too well, in fact.The shaving company’s planned sale to Schick razor maker Edgewell Personal Care Co. officially collapsed on Monday after the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the $1.37 billion deal on anti-competitive grounds.There had been some thought that Edgewell would fight for the Harry’s deal in court, but the company said Monday it’s instead walking away, “given the inherent uncertainty of a potential trial, the required investment of resources and time and the distraction that a continuing court battle would entail.” Shareholders are fine with that: The stock rose more than 20% on Monday after climbing 13% on Feb. 3, when the FTC’s opposition was announced. While investors may be happy to say goodbye to an acquisition that was arguably overpriced, regulators’ opposition to the takeover has wide-ranging ramifications. Among other things, this threatens to close the door on one of the more sure-fire exit strategies for would-be direct to consumer unicorns.In advertisements, Harry's pitched itself as &quot;the shaving company that's fixing shaving.&quot; In its complaint, the FTC argues that Harry’s successfully disrupted an effective duopoly between Edgewell and Gillette-maker Procter & Gamble Co. and forced the incumbents to start lowering their prices for razors. Curiously, it argues that this only happened once Harry’s products migrated out of the e-commerce-only environment in which they launched and started appearing on shelves at Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. stores. Using similar logic, the FTC dismisses Dollar Shave Club – acquired by Unilever NV in 2016 for $1 billion – as a full-blown competitor capable of making up for the loss of an independent Harry's in part because it still mainly sells razors via an online direct-to-consumer model.The idea that firm lines exist between the online and brick-and-mortar worlds — and that pricing dynamics in one don’t affect the other — feels rather silly in this day and age. Most consumers wouldn’t distinguish between the two marketplaces, and increasingly, neither would businesses. The FTC’s decision to block the Harry’s purchase is reminiscent of pushback to the merger of Staples and Office Depot in 2016, where the regulator ignored the stream of sales defecting to Amazon and declined to view it as a strong enough competitor in commercial office supplies. Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc., by contrast, was waved through without a second glance and closed in just two months.Notably, without Harry’s and without the sales from an infant and pet-care business Edgewell sold in December, the company now expects total revenue to decline as much as 5% this year. When Edgewell had announced the Harry’s purchase last year, it projected a $20 million increase to Ebitda by 2023 from annual cost savings and an additional $20 million boost from revenue benefits, including new brand launches and international expansion opportunities. Antitrust regulation isn’t a forward-looking industry and I don’t think anyone would want to task the FTC or the Department of Justice with picking out the winners and losers of the future. But the result is a system that seems ill-suited to navigating the changes to the economy from e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business models. And while regulators may not want to predict the future, their actions will have a significant impact on what unfolds from here.One of the odd messages being sent by this decision is that it may be better for upstart consumer brands to avoid brick-and-mortar stores if they want to sell themselves to a more-established organization down the road. That’s not going to be helpful for Target, Walmart or the bevy of aging department stores trying to compete with Amazon and make themselves relevant to today’s consumer. Another alternative is for startups to sell out before they get big enough to matter, which raises the odds that smaller brands get swallowed up and killed off rather than nourished into viable competitors. The IPO route looks increasingly closed, at least at the valuations many had enjoyed in the private markets. Some brands will still succeed as independent entities – Glossier, Allbirds and Warby Parker come to mind – but the road to making it big arguably just got tougher.To contact the author of this story: Brooke Sutherland at bsutherland7@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-02-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Clorox bleach kills 99.9% of germs, and right now, it’s also beating 99% of stocks. While it probably doesn’t hurt to load up on disinfectants amid the outbreak of a potentially deadly virus, using the same logic to buy shares of the company may not be so prudent. The chlorine-based liquid cleaner is getting a rare opportunity to shine, and unfortunately it’s due to the coronavirus scare. Shares of Clorox Co., which is best known for its bleach and disinfectant products, climbed 2.5% to an all-time high this week — and that’s as most of the S&P 500 index fell. In fact, Clorox’s gains have topped all but two other members of the U.S. market benchmark: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. The two drugmakers are working to develop treatments to combat the illness. Until they do, bleach, it seems, may be one of our best hopes.Clorox generates a third of its revenue from cleaning products for household and professional use, and 85% of its sales occur in the U.S. It’s hardly a fast-growing business, nor is it typical to see large fluctuations in demand, except for in the September quarter at the start of the regular flu season. Sales of Clorox’s cleaning products have held steady at $460 million to $570 million every quarter for the last four years, averaging $508 million over that span. Wet wipes aside, it’s a pretty dry business.But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning that the same flu-like Covid-19 virus that crippled China’s Hubei province and is spreading globally could now threaten the U.S. If that’s the case, Clorox may be about to experience a surge in demand. “So far we’re not seeing an uptick,” Clorox CEO Benno Dorer said during the company’s earnings call Feb. 4, which was before the outbreak grew so severe that there was talk of a pandemic. But “we’re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our health-care institutional customers,” he said. It’s a part of the business Dorer knows intimately, having worked in the cleaning division for years before being named CEO in 2014.The market clearly sees Clorox as a hot commodity. The only problem is that Clorox’s stock is already quite expensive, and it’s not like the sales boost from the coronavirus will be permanent. Clorox trades at 26 times forward earnings, which is 13% higher than its average valuation over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Price-to-earnings ratios for all the consumer-products giants are elevated, but Colgate-Palmolive Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are sill cheaper than Clorox on that metric.Six analysts kept their “sell” ratings on the stock after Clorox’s latest earnings report earlier this month, which showed that two of the company’s other product lines — bags and charcoal — continued to prove troublesome. (Nine have a neutral rating, and only two recommend investors buy the shares.) Clorox had mistakenly raised the prices of its Glad trash bags last year to offset resin costs, but its competitors didn’t follow suit and so it lost market share and had to turn to promotions. The company also said that retailers have been devoting more space to alternative grilling fuels, an area that it’s beginning to move into as sales of its Kingsford charcoal decline; Clorox even renamed that division “grilling” to reflect the shift.In normal times, when the entire planet isn’t raiding supermarket shelves for bleach disinfectant, Clorox’s growth has to come from demand that it creates by developing new versions of its products. When your main products are things like liquid pipe de-cloggers and grease removers, it’s hard to do much in the way of innovation. (Clorox also owns, somewhat randomly, Hidden Valley salad dressings and Burt’s Bees lip care.)With this week’s coronavirus-induced market sell-off, investors are desperate to grab on to shares of the few companies that could stand to benefit from the outbreak. Clorox may play its own crucial role in combating the disease, but its stock is already overheated. To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-03-09,"Stocks are plunging, volatility is skyrocketing and bears are partying like its 2008. The rush into bonds has submerged Treasury yields across the curve -- even out to 30 years -- below 1% for the first time in history. Given the risky backdrop, you'll be forgiven for your desire to sit on the sidelines until some semblance of normalcy returns. But for those brave enough to enter the fray, I have three top stock trades for this week that include some safe stocks to buy.What do I mean by safe? Well, for starters, these stocks have exhibited relative strength during the market meltdown. That is to say, they've fallen far less than the S&P 500. Second, they all boast betas well below the market.So, if the S&P 500 is a hare, these stocks are tortoises.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, two of the three picks are also well-known for their lofty dividend payouts. So in a world where bond yields are seemingly headed toward zero, the appeal of dividend-paying stocks is on the rise.  * 10 Ways to Diversify Your Portfolio at This Time of Crisis That said, here are three top stock trades to consider. Top Stock Trades This Week: Walmart (WMT)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Beta: 0.43The &quot;safeness&quot; of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is on full display this morning. While the rest of Wall Street is having a rough day Monday, WMT stock is not even down 1%. That said, its resiliency is likely a byproduct of two things. First, it belongs to a defensive sector -- consumer staples -- with a history of outperforming during times of turmoil.Secondly, pandemic fears surrounding the coronavirus from China have boosted stocks like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart due to the increased foot traffic as worried consumers snatch-up bottled water, toilet paper and paper products to fill their bunkers.Therefore, because both of these dynamics are likely to remain, Walmart is one of my favorite top stock trades of safe stocks to buy.The Trade: Equity lovers could buy WMT stock outright. Options traders can buy the May $120/$125 bull call spread for around $2.30. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.66Instead of picking individual companies and running the risk that your safe stock suddenly sours, you could opt for a more diversified play using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Moreover, to harness the defensive nature of consumer staples, for example, you could purchase the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP).In addition to Walmart, its top holdings include household names such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP).Compared to the S&P 500's 7% drubbing Monday, XLP is only down 4.5%. Furthermore, from February's peak, the fund off nearly 9%. Meanwhile, the S&P has lost almost 18% of its value over that same time period. The juicy dividend yield of 3.31% for XLP is also likely to keep buyers flocking -- even if prices fall further.Remember, unless the companies comprising XLP start cutting their dividends, the cheaper you can buy the fund, the higher the dividend yield becomes. Which, is the silver lining of corrections and bear markets. Overall, these reasons make XLP a top stock trade for this week.  * 5 High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Great Buyback Programs The Trade: Buy XLP stock. Options traders looking to lever up the potential returns could buy the June $60/$63 bull call spread for $1.50. Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU)Source: Shutterstock Beta: 0.35For our final safe stock pick, we're sticking with the defensive sector theme and choosing the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLU). Utility companies have business models that are less sensitive to economic downturns than virtually every other industry. And as such, they've held up quite well during bear markets of the past.The low beta and relative strength have been on full display this month. Compared to the S&P's whack today and recent peak-to-trough decline, XLU is down 5.7% and nearly 10%, respectively. Additionally, its dividend yield of 2.96% is almost as tasty as the consumer staples ETF.So from a charting perspective, XLU has the best looking chart of all the sectors. It's the only one still above its 200-day moving average. And while the short-term trend is a mess, the long-term picture remains healthy.The Trade: Buy XLU stock. Options traders could buy the June $65/$70 bull call spread for around $2.25.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-03-13,"As poorly as U.S. stocks have performed, there have been bright spots in the market. In past editions of Big Stock Charts, we've tried to highlight some of those bright spots.Source: Shutterstock After Thursday's rout, however, it's almost impossible to do so. Part of the problem is the sheer breadth of the day's declines.Of over 1,500 stocks with a market capitalization over $2 billion, only 14 closed in the green Thursday. And after U.S. stocks fell more than 9% in a single session, only 33 have traded higher over the past month. Many of those names are biotechs or other companies that may actually benefit from the spread of the coronavirus.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Sell as We Enter a Bear Market Friday's big stock charts focus on three consumer names that had held up relatively well during the sell-off that began in late January. Or at least they had, until Thursday. And while the charts look mixed, Thursday's declines are unquestionably bad news. These companies should be able to avoid the worst effects of the coronavirus -- yet their stock prices are plunging anyway. Costco (COST)Source: Provided by Finviz Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) would seem like a potential beneficiary of coronavirus fears. Yet the first of Friday's big stock charts shows a stock clinging to support:  * The technicals look concerning at this point. COST stock is re-testing support that held both in late February (at least relative to its closing price) and in early October. But it's how the stock has returned to support that might be worrisome. Shares quickly fell through moving averages, including a quick plunge through the 200-day on Thursday. And while the stock didn't quite close at the lows on Thursday, it came close.  * That trading is somewhat surprising. After all, there's a case that Costco should benefit from coronavirus fears. Its customers are stocking up across the country. And unlike some grocers, Costco should see a long-term benefit as well, as it picks up new members who presumably will stick around once those fears subside. Add to that a huge opportunity in China as that region gets back to normal, and there's not an obvious reason why COST stock should be selling off along with the market.  * Except for one: valuation. Even after the pullback, Costco stock trades at almost 30x the consensus earnings per share estimate for next year. Even for a company that seems almost immune to competition from Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and one with minimal short-term disruption ahead, that may simply be too high. If it is, that means COST stock is going to keep heading south -- and strongly suggests the rest of the market will do the same. Kroger (KR)Source: Provided by Finviz Even after a 4.8% decline on Thursday, Kroger (NYSE:KR) stock has performed reasonably well in 2020. Shares are modestly positive year-to-date, and have rallied 2.4% over the past month. Looking forward, the second of our big stock charts does suggest some optimism if the stock can avoid another decline today:  * For the most part, the chart does look bullish. A broadening ascending wedge still holds if KR can keep above $29; that pattern actually would predict a bounce to new highs. Kroger stock did fall through the 20-day moving average on Thursday, but held the 50-day. Even with recent volatility, this still looks like a stock headed in the right direction.  * That said, there's not much room for error at the moment. KR can exit the wedge with another decline. It's only narrowly holding the 50DMA. With U.S. futures pointing to another big decline on Friday, KR may see another sell-off. That would suggest a move to late January support around $27 and then the 200-day below $26.  * In that context, KR is an interesting test case for other defensive names. The stock certainly is cheap enough to see buying, at 12.3x Wall Street EPS estimates for fiscal 2020 (ending January 2021). Coronavirus impacts should be limited; in fact, the company could see a short-term boost from consumers stocking up. Fourth quarter earnings last week impressed the market and sent KR stock soaring. This is the kind of name even nervous investors would consider buying. It would be helpful if they started doing so quickly. Clorox (CLX)Source: Provided by Finviz The story with Clorox (NYSE:CLX) sounds similar to those of Kroger and Costco. The third of our big stock charts shows the technical picture is similar as well:  * Here, too, support needs to hold. CLX stock posted a solid and almost textbook rally from November lows, rising steadily and bouncing repeatedly off the 20-day moving average. But the rally has reversed quickly. The stock has posted bearish tests of both the 20-day and the 50-day. CLX now has exited a narrowing ascending wedge, and the last line of support seems to be the 200-day moving average. If CLX breaches that level, the stock could be in trouble.  * As Josh Enomoto detailed last week, the coronavirus seems to be a positive near-term catalyst for Clorox, as it is for Costco. Whether it's a return to bleach ahead of 'natural' and/or 'organic' but less-effective products, or increased sales of disinfecting wipes, nervous consumers should buy more Clorox products for at least the next few months. That tailwind may not fade, either. Yet, as with Costco, investors are selling the stock anyway.  * Valuation is a question. CLX trades at 24x forward earnings despite relatively modest earnings growth. That's not an unreasonable multiple relative to other defensive large-cap consumer plays like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL). But it is a multiple that's exceptionally relatively high on a historical basis. And so the decline in CLX stock may suggest a significant, permanent re-rating of the entire sector, rather than just a panic-driven sell-off.Vince Martin has covered the financial industry for close to a decade for InvestorPlace.com and other outlets.

2020-03-27,"Halting a three-day winning streak, stocks tumbled Friday as investors appeared to sell the news on the House of Representatives passing the $2 trillion stimulus and as coronavirus case data grew increasingly ominous.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 slid 3.37%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4.12%  * The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.79%  * In a best-to-worst reversal, Boeing (NYSE:BA) was the Dow's worst-performing name today after soaring on Wednesday and Thursday.Likely weighing on riskier assets Friday are reports that the COVID-19 case tally in the U.S. is now above 95,000, meaning the U.S. now has far more cases than China. Of course, that's assuming China is publishing accurate numbers, which it probably isn't, but that's a conversation for another time and place.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDeaths in Italy, one of the epicenters of the coronavirus, surged about 10% in a day and the past 24 hours have been deadliest period in the U.S., with the death toll reaching 265.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem New York is being dubbed the epicenter of U.S. coronavirus cases, but confirmations are soaring across the country -- from Nevada to Louisiana and more. The rising case count could be the result of increased testing, which is a positive because more testing allows healthcare professionals to more accurately diagnose and help those in need. However, the pressure on markets is derived from the fact that there simply is no timeline for when life in the U.S. will return to normal.That lack of clarity gets us to an all too familiar scenario: 24 of 30 Dow stocks pointed lower in late trading. Oil WoesExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) may be able to hold their dividends steady, but that might be the extent of the good news coming from the oil giants over the near-term because the energy sector is awash in problems that aren't going away anytime soon.With oil prices poised for the worst quarterly performance in three decades, producers shuttered 40 rigs this week and it appears North American producers are bracing for a significant slowdown as 2020 moves along because there's simply too much supply and not enough demand to stoke anything more than short covering rallies in the oil futures market. Dour News For DisneyDisney (NYSE:DIS) is again proving to be one of the more coronavirus-sensitive Dow stocks. The stock was hammered today after research firm Moffett-Nathanson said Disney could lose $3.4 billion in revenue due to the closures of Disneyland and Disney World.&quot;Putting it all together, despite the fall in Disney's stock price to date, we think the combination of COVID-19 impacts and an ensuing recession will cause unprecedented pain here,&quot; said Moffett-Nathanson. Not Liking What They SeeAnalysts are looking at industrial machinery makers, including Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and unsurprisingly, they don't like what they see with economically-sensitive group.CAT fell about 3% today after Bank of America downgraded the stock from &quot;buy&quot; to &quot;hold&quot; while cutting its price target to from $123 to $115. Analyst Ross Gilardi said investors shouldn't expect energy and mining companies to rapidly boost equipment spending after the COVID-19 scenario abates. P&G PowerAs noted above, there were a handful of Dow winners today, but the real star was Procter and Gamble (NYSE:PG), which jumped over 6% thanks to an upgrade by Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astracha.&quot;We view valuation as reasonable given heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, consistent free cash flow, and current 2.8% dividend yield,&quot; said the analyst in a note to clients. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayEarlier this week, I mentioned that first-quarter earnings season will soon be starting and the results are likely to be ugly. Data confirm my theory as Refinitv points out there have already been 84 negative pre-announcements among S&P 500 members compared to just 39 on the positive side.&quot;The S&P 500 is expected to enter an earnings recession, two consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines, starting in 20Q1 and analysts now expect to see full year 2020 earnings decline 0.2% from the prior year,&quot; said the research firm. &quot;This would be the first full year earnings decline since 2009's -5.8%.&quot;Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-04-17,"A glimmer of hope surfaced overnight in the form of promising coronavirus treatment results from a Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) study, but people shouldn't get carried away.Though the medical news is exciting and the market obviously loves it, some analysts expressed caution. They noted it was a study with no control group, meaning no untreated group of similar patients given a placebo. It's also partial data, not final results. That doesn't mean it isn't worth noting, only that it probably takes more information to really move the needle. GILD expects additional data to become available next month, Reuters reported.Whether or not additional data shows efficacy, it's amazing to see just how much the overall market is responding to any good news right now. It's possible evidence that more of a &quot;risk-on&quot; attitude permeates Wall Street after last month's incredible flight toward safety. GILD shares recently rose double digits, and Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) shares rose sharply as the jet-maker said it plans to reopen production at its Seattle plant. That means 27,000 people coming back to work, which is great news.The market also seems to be getting a lift from President Trump presenting a plan last night to reopen the economy in three stages.More disappointing, but hardly unexpected, were some data that appeared overnight. Chinese Q1 economic growth slid 6.8%. It was the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976. No real surprise there, and it does reflect some pretty dramatic measures China took to slow the virus. What's going to maybe be more interesting is to see what Q2 growth does, now that the country is reopening the economy. Anyway, the news doesn't appear to be having much impact on the market. In crude, there was a contract roll-over last night and it's interesting to see the June CME crude contract (/CLM20) trading near $25 a barrel and barely down for the day. The old May contract expires Tuesday and is more than $6 below the June. Seeing the June contract take the baton with this kind of premium arguably is a sign of economic hope, because higher crude prices in the future suggest firmer global demand. Contracts even farther out are well up into the mid-$30s. This could be a relationship to keep an eye on over time. Another thing to potentially keep an eye on today is Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), which got a big downgrade from Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS). So far, it doesn't appear to be affecting shares.It's been a good week so far, if we can hold this. Last week we had a synthetic Friday (on Thursday) due to the holiday, and things went well. But Fridays have been interesting lately. The last hour of the session could be where things get volatile, and also check to see if there's profit-taking right out of the gate. From a technical perspective, it would be good to see the S&P 500 Index (SPX) hold 2850 by the close. Healthy Check-Up Considering the nature of the global crisis, you might expect the Healthcare sector to be a robust performer. It was exactly that on Thursday, topping the sector leaderboard with a bigger than 2% rise. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) delivered firm Q1 results this week and generated some excitement with its coronavirus testing kits and the stock rolled to new 52-week highs. Something to keep in mind about testing in general, whichever company you're looking at, is these tests tend to be on the cheaper side and may not be big revenue contributors in the great scheme of things.However, if companies can find a way to meet what's expected to be huge demand, they might make up in volume what they lack in price. A company like ABT arguably has the manufacturing bandwidth and financial strength to take big advantage of this, so that's something to consider watching. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) could have a similar scenario addressing the coronavirus vaccine business. No Punishment For Guidance Withdrawal Another thing investors saw with earnings this week is companies like ABT and others pulling their guidance. The economic picture remains too cloudy for anyone to risk giving out numbers now only to change them later and confuse investors. In normal times, a company pulling or declining to give guidance would raise a red flag about possible internal or industry problems. That's not necessarily the case now because there's one big global challenge affecting everyone. Having said that, companies may come under pressure to distribute clearer roadmaps by Q2 earnings season when hopefully the horizon is less foggy. That may be easier for some industries than others, with travel and tourism, Financials, and retail maybe among the ones that could have more challenges than others given the nature of their businesses. Thursday's choppy session ended up on the positive side of the ledger for most major indices, but the small-cap Russell 2000 Index (RUT) continued to struggle as investors worried about the impact on smaller businesses and regional banks (see more below).On Sunny Days, Technology Rolls Up Big Gains As on a lot of recent up-days, Technology found plenty of buyers Thursday, led by some of the big bruisers like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), as well as chip-makers including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD). Many investors appear to be listening to analysts who talk about the importance of finding big names with enough liquidity to possibly weather this situation. As Briefing.com pointed out in a note Thursday, it's almost a &quot;Darwinian&quot; approach playing out among people in the markets.The Nasdaq (COMP), which so many of those tech stocks call home, is actually up almost 7% year-over-year, and that includes a 30% plunge between mid-February and mid-March. It's pretty amazing to look at that chart. While most major indices turned higher yesterday, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped to just over 0.6%, down from the mid-0.7% range last week, in a sign that some investors might be continuing to put their trust in bonds over stocks.The SPX finished just a smidgen shy of 2800 on Thursday and looks to open well above that Friday. That's a level to consider watching next week, too, because it represents approximately a 50% recovery from the March lows back to the February highs and could form an area of technical support.  CHART OF THE DAY: GETTING IN RANGE? For a while there a few weeks ago, it was hard to trade the market because volatility had the S&P 500 Index (SPX--candlestick) gyrating up and down like a jumping bean. Now that volatility has eased a bit, a trading range appears to be forming between the 20-day moving average down near 2570 (yellow line) and the 50-day moving average up around 2870 (red line). The 200-day moving average is the blue line just above 3000. Data Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Chart Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  Taking a Long Look at Volatility: The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) remained just above 40 by the end of the day Thursday, but it almost felt like nostalgia seeing the most major indices move less than 1%. They've already had more 1% or moves this year than they typically have in an entire 12 months, and investors might be getting tired of the whipsaw action. That said, when you see VIX at 40 or above, that's double the long-term average, meaning we can likely expect volatility to continue at high rates over the coming month. After that, the VIX futures complex indicates that traders expect volatility to slowly ease but still not get back to near normal any time this year. VIX futures trade at above 30 through the October 2020 contract as of Thursday, falling to just below 30 for the November and December contracts. At this point, anything under 40 seems relatively mild compared to record-high VIX closes above 80 last month. Even 40, though, is still pretty thin air compared to when VIX traded near 12 earlier this year.Remember, VIX is sometimes called the &quot;fear index&quot; because when the S&P 500 Index (SPX) comes under pressure, the demand for SPX put options increases, which often pushes VIX higher. The VIX is the market's collective estimate of how much the price of the SPX might move up or down over the succeeding 30 days. So a VIX at 14.00 should be interpreted as a 14% annualized level of volatility.Earnings Calendar Starts Filling Up Next Week: Today's earnings included The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB), providing early looks at how one of the big Consumer Staples companies and a major oil field services company are weathering the crisis. Staples have generally been strong as people stock up, while oil fields languish as crude remained at 18-year lows toward the end of the week.SLB shares got a nice boost in pre-market trading after narrowly beating analysts' average earnings per share estimate. PG earnings per share beat Wall Street's estimates, but revenue came in slightly below. Oil field service companies like SLB and Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) saw their shares ride higher earlier this month, but the last week has been tough. Like the cruise ship companies, fundamentals continue to work against any lasting rally. Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE: HON) also reported results today. The calendar next week includes Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), which made new 52-week highs again Thursday as streaming services remain appealing to many investors (and to many of us stuck at home in front of our screens). Other major companies due to report next week include IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM), AT&T, Inc. (NYSE: T), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL), Visa, Inc. (NYSE: V), Eli Lilly and  Company (NASDAQ: LLY), and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL). The following week, earnings really get busy. Things are just starting, so strap in. Smaller Banks Pressure RUT: Drilling down a little further, the weak consumer could be one reason the regional bank-heavy Russell 2000 Index (RUT) continues to lag the broader market. Investors likely are worried about the medium-sized and smaller banks' huge exposure to small business and mortgage loans as the jobless rate climbs and stores and restaurants remain closed. It's hard to see the RUT getting much traction even longer term, because so many analysts expect the recovery to be slow even once things start opening again. Many small businesses might go out of business altogether, and yesterday's dramatically weak housing number could mean trouble for banks trying to make a living with mortgage lending. RUT is getting a boost in pre-market trading this morning, with CME's Russell 2000 futures contract (/RTY) having traded at its overnight limit, up about 5%.See more from Benzinga  * Bleak Picture: Steep Crude Demand Plunge Dogs Energy Industry as Q1 Earnings Results Loom  * Morgan Stanley Misses On EPS, But Shows Strong Trading Results For Q1 As Banks Wrap Up  * Netflix Earnings Preview: With Consumers On Lockdown, Streaming Giant Filling The Void(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

PG posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.17 on revenue of $17.21B. Profits beat Wall Street estimates of $1.13, while revenue missed the mark - the Street wanted to see $17.46 billion out of PG.However, despite missing analyst estimates, PG's quarterly sales in the U.S. still increased by five percent compared to the previous year, thanks in part to the popularity of household staples brands like Charmin toilet paper. For its fiscal year, PG lowered its sales growth guidance to between 3%-4%, down from 4%-5%, which, the company said reflects stronger headwinds from foreign exchange. In February, Procter & Gamble was among many other companies to cut guidance or warn of lower figures for the coming quarter as cases of COVID-19 continued to spread worldwide: PG warned its profits and revenue would be affected as the virus disrupted its supply chain and initially created weaker demand for its products in China.Going into Friday's trading session, shares of PG are down only about 2.5% YTD, while the S&P 500 index (SPX) and Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) have lost about 13% and 17% respectively in that time.See more from Benzinga  * Thursday's Market Minute: Oil Demand Devastated  * Wednesday's Market Minute: Turns Out The Entire Nasdaq Is A Stay-At-Home Trade  * Tuesday's Market Minute: Earnings Season Begins Again",Friday's Market Minute: Can Toilet Paper Save Procter & Gamble?

2020-04-17,"Procter & Gamble Co.  shares rose 1.7% in Friday premarket trading after the consumer goods company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat expectations. Net income totaled $2.92 billion, or $1.12 per share, up from $2.75 billion, or $1.04 per share, last year. Adjusted EPS of $1.17 was ahead of the FactSet consensus for $1.12. Sales of $17.21 billion were up from $16.46 billion last year but below the FactSet outlook for $17.30 billion. P&G says shipment volume on merchandise was boosted by strong consumer demand in North America and certain European markets due to the Covid-19 outbreak, but disrupted in Asian markets for the same reason. The fiscal year 2020 sales outlook has been lowered to a range of 3% to 4% growth from a range of 4% to 5% growth due to foreign exchange pressure. P&G still expects sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%. The FactSet consensus is for sales of $70.35 billion, implying 3.9% growth. The company continues to forecast EPS growth of 235% to 245%, taking into account the impairment charges from the Gillette Shave business in 2019. Adjusted EPS is forecast to rise 8% to 11%.

2020-04-30,"The seasonal suggestion to &quot;sell in May and go away,&quot; an adage spurred by the market's superior performance during certain months of the year, is backed by the numbers more often than not. But whether investors should follow that advice is an annual debate - one that's a lot more complex this year.&quot;The data shows that, on average, the November-April periods outperformed the May-October periods,&quot; says Jodie Gunzberg, chief investment strategist at Graystone Consulting, a Morgan Stanley business. Gunzberg points to monthly S&P; 500 data compiled from January 1928 through March 2020, which shows an average November-April return of 5.1%, versus just 2.1% for May-October.A few other numbers to consider:  * The November-April period delivered positive returns in 65 of 91 years (71%).  * The May-October period delivered positive returns in 60 of 92 years (65%).  * During positive periods, the average November-April return was 11%, versus 8.7% for May-October.  * During negative periods, the average November-April return was -9.6%, versus -10.4% for May-October.Regardless, market strategists and financial experts typically advise investors to avoid timing the market. And this is no ordinary year, as the COVID-19 pandemic has unfurled a global economic slowdown and a frenetic couple months of market action.Let's take a holistic look at the &quot;sell in May and go away&quot; phenomenon as it applies to 2020.

2020-05-08,"It's not like Americans just sit at home watching their calendars and clocks, waiting for this lockdown to end. Things are still going on, the economy is still working. There are still solid consumer stocks to consider. The economy is just operating on a different level and companies that aren't usually headline grabbers -- like toilet paper makers -- are now front and center as consumers refocus their buying priorities.In an economy, there are always bull markets. Sometimes, they're just harder to find.But the fact is, having families locked down means groceries are a big deal, as well as consumer staples. And the kids are likely jumping from Tik Tok to videogames and back again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut companies still run these parts of the economy and there are some great consumer stocks to buy. * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months I have used my Portfolio Grader screening tool to find seven of the best consumer stocks to buy right now. Each of these fit my Growth Investor criteria: * Brown-Forman Class B (NYSE:BF.B) * Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) * Kellogg (NYSE:K) * Hormel (NYSE:HRL) * Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) * Clorox (NYSE:CLX) * Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB)These are pure plays on consumer demand, so this is their prime time. Let's take a deeper look at what makes each of these consumer stocks stand out from the crowd. Best Consumer Stocks to Buy: Brown-Forman (BF.B)Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Brown-Forman started selling Old Forester whisky in 1870. Its primary innovation? Sealed bottles to show they hadn't been tampered with before they got to the customers' hands.It has remained true to its Louisville, Kentucky roots over the 150 years. And the company remains in the hands of a Brown to this day.But the company has added a few brands over the years. It owns eight whiskeys, including Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve; three Scotch brands; three tequilas; one vodka; one liqueur; two wines and a gin.With a $30 billion market cap, it's a good-sized player in the space. And the brands it owns are mid- to top tier names that come with higher prices and higher margins. Also, recent studies have shown that younger generations are buying higher quality liquor and drinking less wine and beer.Plus, this lockdown has seen spirits sales soar. A recent analysis from an industry source says off-premises spirits sales are up 27.4% since the lockdown began.BF.B stock is up 25% in the past 12 months and it has a 1% dividend. This ""sin"" stock is worth a look. Procter & Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Procter & Gamble has been around since 1837 -- Martin Van Buren won the presidency and the Panic of 1837 slammed the economy. The ""panic"" was a major depression that lasted until the mid-1840s.That's quite a time to start a business. But it will teach you to sell what people need at affordable prices if you want to survive. And PG stock has certainly survived over the years.It now has a $280 billion market cap and the kind of economic ""moat"" around its business that even some of my Growth Investor stocks would envy. In fact, it is so big and pervasive that many of its products compete for market among themselves as much as with competitors.This got the company in a bit of trouble a few years ago, when its portfolio was enormous. Fortunately, PG cleaned house and got rid of many of its unproductive brands and refocused its energies on its money makers. Specifically, a very popular brand right now -- Charmin. * 7 Discounted Mortgage REITs to Buy For Juicy Yields PG stock also delivers a very reliable dividend of 2.8%. It's a rock-solid long-term stock, up 8.5% in the past 12 months. Kellogg (K)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Kellogg is another old-school firm that has been in Battle Creek, Michigan since 1906. Not only does it have a prodigious line of cereal products, but it also houses the Keebler Elves cookies, Cheez-Its, Pringles and other snacks and cereals, including the Kashi brand.These are the kinds of comfort foods that already fill the pantries of most houses. But when you're all sitting around the house, these foods are even more prized. These are the go-to brands that generations have grown up on, and that means they're a common denominator when putting together a shopping list.There's no doubt K stock has worthy competitors, but it has been doing well managing its brands and its competition for the past few years. It should be a beneficiary of this time in the economy and even as the economy reopens.K stock is up 11% in the past year, and delivers a healthy 3.6% dividend. Hormel (HRL)Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com Hormel is another company with roots that go back to Austin, Minnesota in 1891.You should be surprised that many of the consumer stocks that have made this list are companies that have more than a century of experience under their belts.As I always point out at Growth Investor, consumers drive this economy. They have for a long time; some of the most durable companies have been selling products that consumers want for decades, if not centuries -- through good times and hard times.This is why these companies are household names. And the best of these companies have been re-focused to compete in the 21st Century in a global economy.HRL stock is a perfect example. While many pork processing plants have shut down HRL is still shipping meats. And before the novel coronavirus, China was in the grips of the African Swine Flu that wiped out 40% or more of its pigs. Hormel was there to augment their demand. * 7 A-Rated REITs to Buy Now HRL stock is up almost 18% in the past year and has a 2% dividend. Activision Blizzard (ATVI)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Activision Blizzard is one of the leading video game producers in the world. Its Activision brand releases games across all platforms, while its Blizzard brand has been involved with many popular games for PCs in particular. It's also very involved in online gaming as well.The Gen Z's, millennials and Gen Xer's have been the target audiences for these games in recent years. But there is growing data that shows a lot of people that put their controller down years ago, are now back online gaming with friends.This is great news for the industry. And again, while much of the economy has stalled, gamers are driving significant demand in these products now.ATVI stock is backed by a $56 billion market cap, which puts it heads and shoulders above the competition. That also means it's more diversified and slightly more stable than some of the smaller players in the space that rely on one or two titles for much of their revenue.ATVI stock is up 22% year to date and 56% in the past 12 months. And Activision in particular has been around since 1979. That means it has weathered plenty of storms, even when gaming was young and volatile. Clorox (CLX)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Clorox started in Oakland, California when Woodrow Wilson became president in 1913. It sold bleach.Now, that might not seem very sexy, but it was good business. As a matter of fact, it didn't have to introduce a second product until 1969. That in and of itself is pretty impressive.Plus, it also means it was growing through WWI, the Great Depression and WWII and beyond, just selling bleach.For a while it was acquired by PG, and even that worked in CLX stock's favor until it unwound the deal and went independent again in '69\. That's when it launched Clorox 2 color-safe bleach and acquired Liquid-Plumr.Today, its cleaning products are flying off the shelves. And this ""boring"" stock is posting returns like it's a tech stock. It's up 37% in the past year; 31% year to date. * 10 Key Stocks to Watch Over the Next Few Months If its sales continue to be strong moving forward, then years from now, CLX stock will continue to deliver for its shareholders. And I've got even stronger buys where that came from. Campbell Soup (CPB)Source: HeinzTeh / Shutterstock.com Campbell Soup was launched in Camden, New Jersey in 1869, four years after the end of the U.S. Civil War.By 1895, it has launched its ready-to-eat tomato soup. And the rest is history.But a few years ago, it looked like CPB stock may well be history. Its famous soups weren't selling and the company was having trouble finding its footing in the grocery aisles.Younger generations weren't reaching for cans of cream of mushroom soup for green bean casseroles and its other standard brands weren't doing much better. CPB stock was off 40% from its 2017 highs by last year.But the company started to make a bigger push into the quality aspects of its brands and refine its product lines. And it has been working. CPB stock is back on a growth track and has regained almost all that loss.In the past 12 months, Campbell is up nearly 30%, and with grocery sales up significantly, that will help improve its earnings even more. It also has a reliable 2.8% dividend.Outside of a crisis, though, consumer staple stocks are tricky if you're looking for growth.That's why I'm more focused on a completely different group, where my favorite stock offers both dividends and huge growth opportunities.

2020-05-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. says the one- and two-day delivery times that shoppers have come to expect should gradually return in coming weeks as the online retailer catches up from a demand surge tied to the coronavirus outbreak.The company on Sunday lifted restrictions on the amount of inventory its suppliers can send to Amazon warehouses and is shortening delivery times -- which had stretched for weeks for some products since the outbreak began -- back to days. The shares rose 2.1% to $2,406 at 10:42 a.m. on Wednesday.Amazon spends months preparing for the surge in consumer demand that usually comes during the holiday season. The Covid-19 outbreak that closed many retail brick-and-mortar stores and sent millions of shoppers online created a month’s worth of Black Friday spending without warning. Once Amazon fell behind, it took several weeks and hiring 175,000 people to get back on track.“We removed quantity limits on products our suppliers can send to our fulfillment centers,” Amazon spokeswoman Kristen Kish said in an email. “We continue to adhere to extensive health and safety measures to protect our associates as they pick, pack and ship products to customers, and are improving delivery speeds across our store.”Even with the delays, Amazon saw a major spike in sales tied to the coronavirus outbreak because shoppers had so few choices. Amazon, big box stores, supermarkets and pharmacies were among the few businesses deemed essential and allowed to remain open. But the delays were starting to tarnish Amazon’s reputation with its customers and its merchants who supply more than half the goods sold on the site.Quick delivery is central to Amazon’s customer promise, helping it attract more than 100 million people who pay monthly or yearly dues for Prime memberships. Prime members spend more on the site than non-Prime members, making it critical for Amazon to get its delivery times back to normal especially as retail stores begin reopening and shoppers have more options.When Seattle-based Amazon was overwhelmed in April, many shoppers saw the long delivery times and shifted their purchases to pickup curbside options offered by Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., said Anthony Ferry, chief executive officer of PriceSpider, which tracks web traffic for more than 1,600 brands, including consumer staples made by Procter & Gamble Co. and Kraft Heinz Co.“Loyal Amazon shoppers left the site when they saw long delivery times or items were out of stock,” he said. “Buy-online pickup-in store has become a much more enticing and desirable solution when people want something now.”Amazon let employees worried about their safety take time off during the outbreak, which increased absenteeism and aggravated the delays. Some lawmakers, unions and workers have criticized Amazon for not doing enough to protect its warehouse workers and continuing deliveries through the pandemic. Company officials have said repeatedly they have taken multiple steps, including extensive cleaning at facilities, to keep its employees healthy.Long delivery times were beginning to erode Amazon’s stellar brand reputation among consumers, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of the New York research firm Marketplace Pulse that monitors the site. Shoppers left 800,000 negative reviews on Amazon’s shopping site in April, double the number in the same month a year ago, with much of the increase attributable to longer delivery times, he said.“Amazon is known for great selection, low prices and fast shipping,” Kaziukenas said. “These all broke during the pandemic. Selection was not always there, prices were not lowest because Amazon sold out, and fast shipping was gone.”Even Amazon’s merchants, many of whom rely on the company to store, pack and ship their products through the Fulfillment By Amazon logistics service, started doing things themselves to quicken the pace of deliveries.Bellroy has been selling wallets, smartphone cases and laptop sleeves on Amazon for seven years and used Fulfillment By Amazon because quick delivery is popular with coveted Prime members. But by the end of March, delivery times for many of its products were as long as 30 days and sales plummeted. Amazon was prioritizing essential items. So Bellroy began packing and shipping many of its products itself, and now does the logistics for about 20% of its sales on Amazon, said Lina Calabria, co-founder and chief operating officer of the company.“When you go to Amazon and see 30-day shipping, our brand is getting mixed in with Amazon’s problems and we don’t want our customers to have a disappointing experience,” she said. ”It seems like we’ve accidentally developed a new strategy for Amazon.”By again reducing its delivery times, Amazon will cut the risk of more merchants defecting from its logistics service, which generated about $14.5 billion, or 19% of its total revenue, in the first quarter. Many sellers are simply waiting for Amazon to clear the delivery clog, said James Thomson, a former Amazon employee who helps merchants sell products on the site through his consulting firm Buy Box Experts.“It doesn’t matter if I advertise on Facebook or Google and redirect people to my site and offer faster delivery than Amazon,” he said. “The biggest problem for a lot of merchants is shoppers just don’t want their products right now.”(Updates with shares in second paragaph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Says Deliveries Returning to Normal After Covid Crush

2020-05-31,"Investors are always ready to buy into a good value, and in today’s markets – with their combination of bear cycle and bull rally – those value stocks are more appealing than ever. Using TipRanks’ database, which features extensive market data collated in real time, we’ve pulled up the details on three great stock market values. All three of these stocks offer investors a solid package: a one-year upside potential of at least 10%, a dividend over 2%, and a history of long-term share appreciation. While all three are down in the current market cycle, Wall Street’s analyst corps sees each of them as a Strong Buy. Even the economic shutdowns, which forced so many companies into losses for Q1, couldn’t derail these three – each showed profits in the quarter, and beat the earnings forecasts. Let’s dive into the details, and find out what makes these three stocks so valuable. Procter & Gamble Company (PG) We’ll start with one of the blue-chip staples of the Dow Jones average. Procter & Gamble showed steady earnings growth through 2019, beating estimates in every quarter, before recording a sharp drop in Q1. That drop, however, needs to be put into context – the company’s calendar first quarter is historically its lowest of the year. Not to mention Q1 2020 reflected both a fifth consecutive earnings beat and a modest year-over-year gain of 4.4%, despite the economic shutdowns. In an odd way, the coronavirus crisis may have even helped PG – the company’s strong presence in the home & consumer health, personal care, and hygiene niches meant that demand for PG products remained strong, even as overall consumer activity declined. In the company’s Q1 earnings release (PG’s fiscal Q3), the company reported 4.2% year-over-year revenue growth. In addition to its solid position in the current environment, Procter & Gamble is also one of the market’s true dividend champs. The company has a 16-year history of steady dividend growth and reliable payments. The current payment is 79 cents, the company raised it by 4 cents in Q1, annualizing to $3.16 per quarter and giving a yield of 2.7%. While that is only slightly higher than the consumer goods sector average of 2.5%, Procter’s dividend is backed by that long history – and it has a payout ratio of 64%, indicating that the payment is easily sustainable with current income levels. Covering PG stock for Evercore ISI, Robert Ottenstein headlines his note “Better, More Resilient, Wiser.” As for forward prospects, Ottenstein writes, “We see Procter as a reliable 6-8% EPS grower, as underscored by the firm’s confidence to raise the dividend by 6% in the face of unprecedented challenges…” Ottenstein keeps his Buy rating on PG shares, and raises his price target from $130 to $140. This implies 21% upside potential for the stock in the coming 12 months. (To watch Ottenstein’s track record, click here) Overall, PG’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 10 reviews, which include 9 Buys against a single Hold. Wall Street is slightly less aggressive here than Ottenstein, but the $133 average price target still suggests an upside potential of 15%. (See Procter & Gamble stock analysis on TipRanks) Linde PLC (LIN) Next up is Linde, an important player in the industrial gas industry. This is not a consumer utility; rather, Linde dominates the market for pure gasses such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and argon, along with compound gasses such as carbon monoxide. All have important uses in industry, especially within the medical and HVAC sectors – which have been deemed essential even during the public health crisis. Like PG above, Linde has a secure niche and product line-up despite the recessionary pressures. The quality of Linde’s market position is demonstrated by the quarterly performance. Where most companies registered declines or even losses, Linde reported Q1 EPS level with Q4. At $1.89, the quarterly earnings beat the forecast by 3.2%, and was the fifth quarter in a row to top the estimates. In another similarity to PG, Linde’s continued profitability is directly related to its strong presence in the healthcare industry. Some 20% of company revenues come from sales in the medical field (oxygen, for example, is a vital item in treating respiratory ailments), and Linde has been able to successfully absorb losses in other segments. With revenues secure, Linde was not shy about declaring its dividend going forward. The company announced that it will pay out 96 cents per share in Q2. That annualizes to $3.85, and gives a yield almost exactly at the S&P average: 2%. Michael Sison, 5-star analyst with Well Fargo, makes the simple case for LIN shares, “[We] believe this stable cash flow business and strong balance sheet make LIN an attractive story in the current uncertain environment.  We also view LIN as a growth story, with the $9.5B project backlog as the pipeline for future earnings growth.  Finally, we continue to expect the company to deliver on additional merger cost and revenue synergies once the recovery starts to take shape, likely before 2021.” To this end, Sison puts a $235 price target on the stock, showing his confidence in a 16% one-year upside potential. With this positive outlook, Sison rates the stock a Buy. (To watch Sison’s track record, click here) LIN is another stock with a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares have 22 reviews on record, breaking down into 17 Buys and 5 Holds. The current trading price is $202.34, and the average price target of $216 implies room for 7% growth this year. (See Linde stock analysis on TipRanks) Raytheon Technologies (RTX) Last on our list is Raytheon, a staple in the aerospace and defense industries, as well as a major contractor for the Pentagon. Raytheon’s better-known products include radars for the Air Force’s front line fighter aircraft and many of the military’s front line air-to-air and air-to-surface guided missiles.  No one ever went broke selling weapons, and Raytheon is a good example of that old saw. The company’s $1.78 Q1 EPS was 60% higher than the estimates. Even more impressive, it was the eighth quarter in a row that RTX beat the earnings estimates. The solid EPS was derived from $18.2 billion in revenues, a figure in-line with both the estimates and the year-ago figure. Raytheon management declared a 47.5 cent quarterly dividend, to be paid out in June. In deference to the difficult economic times, and the possibility of reduced defense contracts as budgets contract, this dividend was a sharp decline from the 74 cents paid out in Q4. The important point for investors, however, is that Raytheon remains committed to maintaining its dividend, with the yield at 2.8%, which is above the industrial goods sector average of 2%. In his note on RTX for Credit Suisse, 5-star analyst Robert Spingarn states, “[We] assume that RTX defense can sustain a 2019-2022 sales CAGR of 6%+ (consistent with its record backlog), and that improving trends for defense margins, working capital, and capex can offset pension headwinds, then RTX defense likely stands to generate ~$5.3 billion of FCF in 2022…” This solid outlook contributes to his Buy rating and $81 price target on the stock. At current prices, this target implies a 26% potential upside to RTX. (To watch Spingarn’s track record, click here) With a share price of $64.52, and an average price target of $75.25, RTX boasts a 17% upside potential for the next 12 months. The consensus on the Street here is a Strong Buy, with 11 Buy reviews and 3 Holds. (See Raytheon stock analysis on TipRanks)",3 “Strong Buy” Value Stocks Gearing up for Gains
2020-05-31,"Investors fortunate enough to have bought Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stock at its March 23 low of $54.22 per share have made a very nice return. Since then, Chevron stock rebounded nicely to trade in the low-$90s for the past month. At $91.70, there's a lot of upside between here and $120, which is where CVX traded for basically all of 2019.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Share prices may very well rise to meet those pre-pandemic levels. And investors will continue to pile on considering its potential upside. But even if they do, I'd stay away from Chevron for several reasons.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Chevron Stock Revenue Per Share Continues SlidingInvestors like to see revenue per share within a given company rise. After all, they give their money to companies for shares of stock. The underlying premise is that companies will invest it wisely, producing increasing revenue, and ultimately, rising stock prices.But Chevron stock's revenue per share has been doing the opposite for the past five years. And that should make investors think twice. Chevron does not have the ability to make money as easily as it did in the past. The dual shocks of recent oil price wars and coronavirus put that truth in stark contrast for the entire oil industry. Not just Chevron. But even before the recent shocks, signs like Chevron's sliding revenue per share year-after-year pointed to the same conclusion …  Oil's heyday has likely passed.  * 10 Penny Stocks to Buy Under $5 That Might Be Worth the Risk Fossil fuel pundits will point to alternative energy, and its inability to thus far supplant oil, to counteract the idea that oil is on the decline. They'll also project that oil will have a resurgence in the coming years because crude prices are near decade lows. And while oil may rise again, the trend toward a more varied energy landscape is an irreversible one. Chevron's stock will feature heavily in this conversation. Gross Margins Are SlippingTo be fair, oil has been having a rough go of it over the last several years. So, Chevron does deserve some leeway in that its industry faces strong external headwinds. But gross margins have been decreasing 5.7% long-term. That means the cost of goods sold has increased relative to revenue. Put another way, it has cost Chevron more and more to make a dollar, each of the past five years. Investors want to buy shares in companies that adapt efficiently, finding new revenue in changing times. Chevron hasn't been able to do that. Being an Aristocrat Isn't Always GreatThe company is a member of the so-called dividend aristocrats. As per Investopedia, the dividend aristocrats are companies distinguished by having paid increasing annual dividends for the past 25 years.>Being a dividend aristocrat is viewed positively by the market. The expectation is that these companies will continue to do what they have done for such a long period of time -- consistently increase their dividends.Part of the reason such established companies pay dividends is as an enticement to investors. Dividend aristocrats are not companies that are going to grow at a fast pace. Such days are well behind these companies. Investors do not purchase a Chevron or a Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) with the expectation of making a significant return on investment via stock price appreciation. Rather, investors purchase these companies under the assumption that dividend income will flow therefrom. And it does -- but this predictability comes at a cost. Chevron Stock's Payout Ratio Is UnhealthyChevron's dividend payout ratio is among the weakest in the oil and gas industry over the past decade-plus. This puts Chevron's management between a rock and a hard place. Investors love Chevron's dividends, but management is hamstrung by them. InvestorPlace's Thomas Neil sees the same inherent dividend problem facing Chevron, adding that recent stock gains are likely to taper off.The problem for Chevron and the other dividend aristocrats is simple. These companies must prioritize dividends each quarter, no matter the circumstances. That gets expensive, and it means that Chevron has to sacrifice that cash for the dividend even when there are other needs within the company. Because the market will react swiftly to punish dividend stocks that unexpectedly miss a dividend payout.There's little risk of Chevron reducing or missing a dividend soon. But that's not really what's important. The more cash Chevron has to earmark quarter after quarter to pay ever increasing dividends, the less it has to reinvest in the company. For Chevron (a company in a changing industry), such cash could otherwise be directed toward investments that improve efficiency, gross margin and revenue per share. Bottom Line on ChevronFundamental stock analysis views all of the problems listed above as red flags. These warning signs don't bode well for Chevron in the medium to long term. As an investor, such factors should give you pause when deciding whether to add Chevron to your portfolio.Technical analysts will view Chevron based much more on the movement of stock's recent price with less regard for underlying financial indicators. And neither school of thought is inherently wrong or right. Each investor views the market through their own particular lens.Personally though, in judging a mature stock like Chevron, I like to first see fundamentally sound financials, and then positive technical indicators. In this case, I see little of the former, giving me no reason to search for any of the latter.As of this writing, Alex Sirois did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-06-04,"Founded in 2015, Insense is a platform that allows brands to create custom assets and run influencer campaigns at scale, such as for short-form videos. This is definitely a red-hot category because of the growth and dominance social media sites like Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), TikTok and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Well, interestingly enough, you can also invest in Insense stock.Source: Shutterstock How? The company is currently running an equity crowdfunding campaign on Republic. So far, it has raised $25,924 from 63 investors.So let's get some background on this startup. The founders include Danil and Anton Saliukov, who are brothers that grew up in the Russian city of Ufa (Alexander Fedorenko soon joined them as another founder). Before starting Insense, Anton operated an advertising agency and Danil was a content manager at Qiwi (NASDAQ:QIWI).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut the brothers got the entrepreneurial itch. They saw that they could leverage their online marketing experience and they also had first-hand experience of some of the pain points, such as with Instagram.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts So, they set out to create a service to provide more transparency, better ad metrics and an easier process for connecting with influencers and professional creators. How It WorksThere are five main steps when using Insense. Here's a look:  * Brief: You will fill out a form, which will include the campaign goals, the content needed and so on. Insense will then review it and provide feedback. After this, the brief will be sent to creators (there are over 35,000 in the networks).  * Responses: In some cases, a creator will provide a proposal within a few hours. Although, for the most part, there should be enough responses within about three days. Keep in mind that there are no middlemen, such as agencies.  * Chat: As you cull through the responses, you can then setup chat sessions, which are integrated in a centralized profile that helps to manage all the communications.  * Content: In several days, you will then start getting samples of creative content.  * Publish: Once you have the content you like, Insense has tools to get distribution. For example, there is a Facebook Ads Manager integration, in which you can run targeted ads.Of course, when it comes to evaluating Insense stock, the key is the traction. Then, how has the company done so far?  According to the investor profile, the year-over-year growth is at 2x and the gross sales are estimated to hit $3.8 million by the end of 2020. The company makes money from two main sources: a content production fee, which can be up to 30% of the campaign, and there is a premium monthly subscription that has three pricing tiers.Consider that there are over 30 clients with 65 brands. Some include Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), Uber (NYSE:UBER) and L'Oreal (OTCMKTS:LRLCY). Insense notes that its approach is four times faster in delivering video assets and ten times cheaper than traditional studios. Bottom Line on Insense StockFor the crowdfunding round, the valuation for Insense is set at $10 million and the minimum investment amount is only $100. The company is also offering a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) instrument to investors. This means that equity is not allocated until there is a ""trigger event,"" such as an acquisition or IPO.However, on such an event, the investor will get a 20% discount to the valuation.But as with any early stage startup investment, there are considerable risks. No doubt, the online marketing category is intensely competitive, with operators like Vidmob, Animoto, Genero and Vidsy.co. Moreover, it is difficult to build a thriving marketplace, as there needs to be significant scale and a balance for the buyers and sellers.In other words, before making an investment in Insense stock, it's important to do your own research and analysis.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price.

2020-07-02,"China's disciplined approach in isolating and treating those infected with the novel coronavirus allowed the country to re-open sooner. The rest of the world is following China's lead. As the world economy restarts, international stocks will fare the best. Its geographic diversity will work in its favor as strong growth in re-opened countries offsets a temporary shutdown in other places.Savvy investors may build a geographically diversified portfolio, but that is not easy. There are currency exchange rate risks to consider. So, buying worldwide conglomerates may pay off in the long-run. Plus, investors get the benefit of spreading out risks.There are seven international stocks to buy as the world economy restarts:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips* The Unilever Group (NYSE:UL)* The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)* Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)* Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)* Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM)* Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB)* AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN)  * 7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring Dividends Together, these international stocks give investors exposure to a wide variety of sectors. Consumer goods, e-commerce, automotive, and drug manufacturing all have their growth potential. Plus, a re-start will accelerate the near-term growth of companies in their respective markets. Unilever Group (UL)Source: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.com First up on this list of international stocks is Unilever. The Unilever Group is in the news after joining other firms in boycotting ad spending on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for the rest of the year. This is an unfortunate decision and does signal some risks in holding UL stock. The company reported flat sales growth in the first quarter due to the stay-at-home order. But stockpiling last quarter and the re-opening should lift results.In Q1, Unilever signaled its confidence in its cash flow growth by keeping its dividend levels. As consumers return to stores, Unilever's sales should recover. Still, the company must adjust to the ever-lasting impact of people staying at home. So, instead of relying on ice cream and food that restaurants and cafes buy, the company needs to pivot.Unilever stock has a strong overall rating. As a bonus, the stock offers a good dividend for income investors.Source: Data courtesy of Stock Rover Increasing its focus on laundry detergents, hand sanitizers, and soap products should give profit margins a lift. In the near-term, expect a better entry point approaching. Analysts have a $48.42 price target (according to Tipranks). And if more restaurants are open, Unilever's sales should bounce back in the next quarter. The Procter & Gamble Company (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Procter & Gamble's priority of ensuring the health and safety of everyone around the world already makes the company a recession-proof holding. Looking ahead, family demands for maintaining health, hygiene, and cleaning will only grow. The devastating virulence of the coronavirus will only increase such needs.In the first quarter, P&G increased its dividend by 6% to about 79 cents a share. And as consumers choose their brands first, sales will increase as people slowly return to their normal lives. From fiscal 2012 to Fiscal 2016, P&G created $10 billion worth of growth and value. It will repeat that feat from the fiscal year 2017 to 2021.By disrupting the market, the company comes out ahead in a variety of sectors. This includes beauty, grooming, family care, and health care.According to Stock Rover, PG stock is worth $160.53. It scores well on quality.PG Industry S&P 500 Quality Score 87 61 79 Gross Margin 49.90% 38.50% 29.10% Operating Margin 21.90% 18.60% 13.20% Net Margin 7.10% 10.10% 8.70% Data courtesy of Stock Rover  * 9 Florida Stocks to Avoid as Coronavirus Rates Spike Expect P&G to expand its operating margin as the economic rebound unfolds. Its net margin could exceed that of the industry next. Alibaba (BABA)Source: Colin Hui / Shutterstock.com Alibaba still trades at a discount. The strong growth in e-commerce every quarter suggests that markets continue to underestimate their potential. With China leading the economy's reopening, Alibaba's digital economy business will expand. In the fourth quarter, Alibaba's digital economy gross merchant volume exceeded $1 trillion (slide 3). It now has 960 million global annual active customers (AAC).Investors may forecast Alibaba's revenue growing by at least 17% or higher in the next five years annually. With the following input, Alibaba stock has a fair value of $265.42.Source: Data courtesy of finbox At 780 million China and 180 million international AAC, Alibaba is in a strong position to grow its market share. Plus, consumers will spend more time buying things online. Furthermore, the e-commerce giant has a chance to increase its food and grocery business as customers grow accustomed to buying these goods online.In the cloud computing space, Alibaba Cloud continues to benefit from the increasing demand for video content consumption. Remote working and learning also lifted demand.At a price-to-earnings (P/E) below 30 times, BABA stock has an excellent growth profile against its deep value. Coca-Cola Company (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com Just as Unilever cut its ad spending, Coca-Cola said it would do the same. The pop drink supplier is pausing all social media ad spending for July. Again, this suggests that the company's revenue growth is slowing and that its ads are not effective in reversing that decline.KO stock lost nearly one-third of its value in the last five years:Chart courtesy of Stock RoverAccording to Tipranks, analysts have a $51.40 price target. At an 8% discount rate, a 5-year discounted cash flow model would arrive at a similar fair value.Source: Data courtesy of finbox The economy's restart should put KO stock in firmer territory as it cuts unnecessary spending. And as sales recover, profits will expand at a better pace than ever. Collectively, beverage companies &quot;spent over a billion dollars to advertise sugary drinks and energy drinks in 2018.&quot; So, strong brand recognition should lead to continued double-digit sales of Coca-Cola products despite the ad spending freeze.  * 10 Value Stocks to Keep on Your Short List At a price-to-earnings below 20 times, Coca-Cola shares are too cheap to ignore, especially as international markets reopen. Toyota Motor (TM)Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Automotive companies faced slumping sales at the height of the pandemic-driven lockdown. The easing should lead to a rebound in sales. International stocks like Toyota Motor not only trade at favorable valuations of around 10 times earnings, but have a good performance record.Toyota makes reliable cars that require minimal maintenance. Those who have to go to work and want to avoid public transportation will want to buy a Toyota.Still, Toyota's sales rebound will not happen until after July at the earliest. The company forecasts a 10% drop in production volume in July. This is a solid improvement from the 40% decrease in June.  As global demand recovers, domestic production will bounce back. Toyota forecasts sales will recover to last year's levels by the end of 2020. Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Source: Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.com In a long-term trading range of $130 - $145, Kimberly-Clark stock is ready to break out to the upside. In the first quarter, the company posted non-GAAP earnings of $2.13 a share. Revenue grew 8.2% from last year.KMB stock held up well because of the crazed demand for toilet paper in the last quarter. Looking ahead, the company has a few priorities that will sustain its growth. In addition to protecting the health and safety of its employees and customers, it will manage its global supply chain and manage the business for volatility.For instance, CEO Mike Hsu said: &quot;Like other companies, we haven't significantly pared back our SKU count, and that we've done that in partnership with our customers, who have been very supportive along that journey. And that has increased our theoretical capacity because we have fewer changeovers and less complexity in the plants.&quot;  * 5 Penny Stocks Under $10 to Buy in June By running efficiently, KMB shares could bounce higher as demand patterns recover in places like Asia, Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. AstraZeneca (AZN)Source: Shutterstock Last on this list of international stocks is AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca is not only an international stock idea but it is also a coronavirus vaccine play. The company signed a $127 million deal to produce an experimental vaccine for the Brazilian government. The country will receive material to produce 30.4 million doses later this year. The deal will bring 100 million vaccines. This accounts for nearly half of Brazil's residents. AstraZeneca will transfer the technology if the vaccine works.Brazil is one of the hardest-hit countries of the virus and has more than a million confirmed cases.The company's AZD1222 vaccine is a co-development with the University of Oxford. Italy's pharma giant, Catalent, will manufacture the drug starting in August 2020.AstraZeneca shared its data on three cancer studies. Tagrisso, which treats adjuvant lung cancer, is in Phase III. Imfinzi is in Phase III and treats extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. And Enhertu is in Phase II trials in gastric, lung, and colorectal cancers.On Stock Rover, AZN stock has an 87/100 score on quality. Its gross margin is 49.9% and may potentially rise as the economy re-opens.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

By 2030, the company will cut those emissions in half and invest $100 million over the coming decade in nature-based projects, such as tree planting, to offset the rest. But direct emissions, known in climate accounting as Scope 1 and 2, make up only a small fraction of P&G’s total greenhouse-gas footprint: about 4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.The rest of the company’s emissions, accounting for more than 98% of its annual total, are produced in its vast supply chain or through the use of goods by consumers running washing machines with Tide detergent or showering with Pantene shampoo. Virginie Helias, P&G’s chief sustainability officer, says the company has initiatives to reduce the Scope 3 total, such as ensuring that 70% of laundry loads are run on low-energy wash cycles and eliminating deforestation caused by its palm-oil suppliers. But the company has no explicit goals set for all of its Scope 3 emissions.P&G is trying to catch up to its peers on setting and meeting ambitious sustainability goals. P&G Chief Executive Officer David Taylor says it’s taking urgent steps to address emissions: “We believe, with everything we know today, that we must move faster and move more significantly.” Those moves, for now, rely more on offsets than emissions cut. P&G will fund offset programs that aid reforestation in Brazil, tree-planting in California and Germany, and protection of mangroves in Philippines. Each of these projects is run by a respected environmental group: World Wildlife Fund, Arbor Day Foundation, and Conservation International, respectively. These efforts promise to capture on average about 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year—less than 2% of the total emissions P&G disclosed in its new sustainability report. (The company may invest in additional nature-based climate solutions, Helias says.)Taylor in an interview stood by P&G’s reliance on offsets, even while acknowledging the limitations. “I don’t disagree that offsets should not be the first thing,” he says. “We’re working very aggressively with our goal to reduce [Scope 1 and 2 emissions] by 50%, but we have some areas where we’re not able to.”Even with the new cuts, P&G can still do a lot more to directly reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The company gets about 70% of its electricity from renewable sources right now, and aims to reach 100% by 2030. “Carbon offsets are really the last choice on the list of solutions”Dependence on nature-based offsets has become controversial among environmentalists. Trees take decades to grow and capture the promised amount of CO2, and many projects fail to monitor and verify whether the carbon savings are real. “Carbon offsets are really the last choice on the list of solutions,” says Carole Ferguson, head of investor research at CDP, which runs a global environmental disclosure system.One of P&G’s global rivals, U.K.-based Unilever Plc, recently announced a plan to zero-out a large chunk of its emissions by 2039, including about a third of those under Scope 3. In contrast to P&G, Unilever said it would wait as long as possible to invest in carbon offsets. The company plans to spend $110 million each year over the next decade on nature-based solutions but won’t count those against its emissions.“We could announce that we are carbon neutral today by just spending money on offsets,” Marc Engel, Unilever’s global head of supply chain, told Bloomberg Green in June. “But we have deliberately decided not to do that.”Unilever’s goal accounts for the Scope 3 emissions from its supply chain but not those from its customers. Both P&G and Unilever say they have the least control over how people use their products.As companies face increasing pressure to cut emissions, the use of offsets is set to grow rapidly. In February, for instance, Delta Air Lines committed to spend $1 billion on offsets over the next decade.“Ten years ago, most of these companies would not even have us in the lobby. Now they are bringing up topics like climate, plastics, recycling and even biodiversity into the C-suite,” says M. Sanjayan, chief executive officer of Conservation International, an environmental group that provides offsets to large companies such as the Walt Disney Co. “It’s been a remarkable transformation.”Not having any Scope 3 targets is becoming less acceptable. The corporate sustainability-oriented Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), run by a group of environmental organizations that includes CDP and WWF, is pushing its partners to address this large subset of emissions. Any company with more than 40% of its total emissions coming from its customers and supply chain must set Scope 3 reduction target for its plan to align with the Paris climate agreement, according to the most recent standards outlined by SBTi.P&G says that its science-based targets were approved by SBTi in 2018 and align with the goal specified by Paris of keeping global temperature rise “well below 2°C.” SBTi updates its target-setting criteria annually, however, and the group says the criteria for Scope 3 targets look different today than two years ago.“We are already working on further Scope 3 [emissions targets]—business by business,” says P&G’s Helias. “Our goals need to drive the right behavior and the greatest impact.”That doesn’t placate P&G’s critics, including CDP’s Ferguson, who singles out the new commitment’s focus to offset only Scope 1 and 2 emissions. “I just don’t think it’s good enough,” she says.(Updates seventh paragraph with a more recent renewables goal.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Procter & Gamble’s Climate Commitment Leaves Most Emissions Untouched

2020-07-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The balkanization of the internet continues.The European Union’s top court called a halt on Thursday to the main way companies transfer data across the Atlantic. The Privacy Shield, as it is known, allows for data from Europe to remain subject to the region’s data privacy laws when shifted to the U.S. However, the European Court of Justice ruled that U.S. law made such data vulnerable to intelligence snooping, breaching privacy regulations.The case was elevated to the ECJ after years of legal challenges by privacy campaigner Max Schrems against Facebook Inc. in Ireland, the adtech giant’s European base. While the ruling might make some processes trickier for the tech behemoths, their global scale means they are better placed to handle its fallout than smaller firms.Companies are now exposed to greater legal risk if they decide to transfer data out of the region. The ECJ left a mechanism called Standard Contractual Clauses (or SCCs) in place which will allow firms to do so, but the conditions are strict, according to Tamara Quinn, a lawyer at Osborne Clarke in London. It will be a lot easier to handle for the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft Corp. or indeed Procter & Gamble Co., all of whom have significant international footprints, than it will a small business.Take a company’s human resources department, for instance. Until now, employee data could be easily transferred between Europe and the U.S., meaning a Seattle firm could readily manage payroll for European employees from the other side of the world. That’s now tricky. But if you’re P&G, with more than 30,000 employees in Europe, it’s likely to make less of a difference than if you’re a Texas-based widget-maker with 100 employees that just opened a one-person sales office in Munich. Suddenly you may have to add more back-office jobs in Europe when holding employee and customer data in the region.It may be even more troublesome for companies whose business is digital. Whereas a San Francisco-based startup could previously launch an offering in Europe without any physical presence there, that might no longer be feasible. And European startups who outsource some data analysis to third parties, or even have engineering teams in the U.S., will also encounter greater difficulty.Continuing business won’t be impossible, because of those SCCs, which comprise agreements between sender and recipient that aim to protect the individuals whose data is being transferred. But it’s a tougher legal hurdle that could gum up the process.Again, these dynamics play into the hands of the cloud computing giants whose existing European data centers could make their legal compliance a selling point. There could even be more re-shoring of capabilities to Europe.It looks like another repercussion of intelligence threats impinging upon the free flow of trade. The ruling falls the same week as the U.K. banned gear made by China’s Huawei Technologies Co. from its next-generation communications networks. Just as the Edward Snowden leaks revealing the extent of U.S. espionage collaboration with the tech industry prompted Schrems’s campaign, it was U.S. fears that China might co-opt Huawei equipment for its own ends that helped bring about the U.K. ban.

2020-07-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China’s cosmetic brands may finally be ready to face down their foreign rivals, thanks to the Covid outbreak and a wave of patriotic buying. The rising popularity of domestic makeup products is an example of how the pandemic upheaval and geopolitical tensions are creating unexpected winners and losers.Shares of Proya Cosmetics Co., Guangdong Marubi Biotechnology Co. and Shanghai Jahwa United Co. have soared this year, outpacing the gain in Shanghai’s benchmark index. Meanwhile, mid-range cosmetics makers such as Japan’s Shiseido Co. and South Korea’s Amorepacific Corp. — those most vulnerable to the rise of Chinese competition — have sunk by more than broad market indexes in their home countries.To understand the shift, look at the change in consumer habits brought about by the coronavirus. Lockdowns have forced people to stay at home while unemployment has pummeled incomes, encouraging consumers to spend more time online and to search for lower-priced goods. China’s digital-savvy makeup brands were perfectly positioned to take advantage.Companies such as Proya have been ahead in using tools such as livestreaming and online celebrities to sell their products. The Hangzhou-based cosmetics manufacturer hired singer-songwriter Cai Xukun as a brand ambassador, and holds livestreaming sessions on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Taobao shopping site that last as long as 16 hours a day. As much as 86% of local cosmetic products are sold online in China, versus 58% for multinationals, according to a June report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.The virus has helped in another way, by spurring demand for products that can soothe skin irritated by constant wearing of face masks. Dr. Yu, a face cream sold by Shanghai Jahwa, chalked up a 500% surge in surge in revenue in the first quarter compared with a year earlier.Tensions with the U.S. and a series of spats with countries from the U.K. to India have also driven China’s consumers to turn away from overseas products and seek local alternatives. The disputes have stoked nationalistic fervor among younger people who already hold a less favorable view of foreign brands and are more adept with digital commerce. Dr. Yu was named as as one of the top patriotic brands in a report by the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post earlier this year.Others have benefited, including closely held Shanghai Pehchaolin Daily Chemical Co., the country’s biggest domestic skincare company. As of last year, its 89-year-old Pechoin brand had 7.3% of China’s mass skincare market, second only to L’Oreal SA, according to Euromonitor data. Chando, owned by Shanghai-based Jala Group, was tied for third place on 5.5% with Procter & Gamble Co.’s Olay. The trend is disturbing a long-established order. Color cosmetics and skincare are two of the product areas where overseas multinationals have traditionally held sway. With money trapped at home and consumers “reshoring” their spending, that’s under threat.If China’s neighbors are any guide, this shift could have a lot further to run. Multinationals still account for as much as 46% of the country’s mass-market cosmetics revenue. In Japan and South Korea, their share is in the low to mid-teens. There’s plenty more skin in the game for the likes of Dr. Yu. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nisha Gopalan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and banking.

2020-07-30,"Over the past three months, shares of Procter & Gamble Inc. (NYSE: PG) rose by 12.30%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Procter & Gamble has.Procter & Gamble's Debt Based on Procter & Gamble's balance sheet as of April 20, 2020, long-term debt is at $23.31 billion and current debt is at $12.70 billion, amounting to $36.01 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $15.39 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $20.62 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Procter & Gamble has $118.56 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.3. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. For example, a debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: Procter & Gamble Q4 Earnings  * Earnings Outlook For Procter & Gamble  * Afternoon Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-30,Economic & Earnings Data Deluge,Economic & Earnings Data Deluge
2020-07-31,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic has given rise to some big changes in consumer behavior. We’re all familiar with the obvious ones by now, including more meals at home, fewer trips on airplanes and a dearth of reasons to buy high heels or suits. But after a batch of big-name consumer companies reported earnings in recent days, it’s become clear those changes were just the beginning.The Covid-19 situation has created a spider web of indirect, secondary shifts in shopping habits and consumer appetites that are just as consequential for brands and retailers as the bigger, broader trends. How companies respond will serve as a key test of their adaptability and creativity. Here are just a few examples: A Skincare Star Fades: In recent years, the upscale SK-II beauty brand has been a bright spot in Procter & Gamble Co.’s portfolio. The skincare line, which counts $299 “facial treatment essence” and $325 serum among its offerings, has regularly been called out as a catalyst of sales growth in the company’s beauty division. But in the quarterly results reported Thursday, SK-II turned out to be a blemish, with the company saying sales declined “double digits” in the brand. Why? Blame it on empty airports. Executives said travel disruptions exacted a major toll, meaning that the closure of duty-free shops – or the lack of foot traffic to them – caused sales to evaporate. International travel patterns aren’t likely to return to any semblance of normal any time soon, so P&G must figure out how it can work with retail partners such as Sephora, Bluemercury, and to a lesser extent, department stores, to plug the gap.Gum Gets Bitten: Packaged-food giant Mondelez International Inc. said Tuesday that sales at its gum and candy division plunged 33% in the quarter from a year earlier, a decline it said was mostly attributable to chewing gum. It’s not that customers suddenly had an aversion for its Trident or Stride brands. It’s that gum consumption is very dependent on people being away from their homes. It’s chewed on the go to have fresh breath for meetings or first dates – activities that are largely on pause right now. It doesn’t help that gum is often a convenience-store or drugstore impulse buy, seeing as those kinds of shopping trips are being foregone with more people embracing online shopping for groceries and household essentials. This suggests that Mondelez would be wise for now not to waste advertising dollars or promotional spending on gum, and instead funnel it toward brands such as Oreo and Ritz that have a better chance of making people’s shopping lists.  If You’re Going Out, Get Me One, Too: Starbucks Corp. reported earnings Tuesday, and as you might expect — given that many of its U.S. cafes were closed for much of the June quarter — U.S. traffic slumped from a year earlier by a whopping 52%. At the same time, though, average ticket, or the average total bill, rocketed 25% from a year earlier. This isn’t because some strange subset of people was suddenly mainlining caffeine; it’s because customers were placing far more group orders. Think about it: If you visited Starbucks in pre-pandemic times, it was probably to grab a single drink to slurp at your cubicle. Now, with the whole family stuck at home, a trip to Starbucks might include a latte and breakfast sandwich for your spouse and a donut for each of your kids. This bundling of orders is not necessarily a bad thing for restaurants. In fact, it makes the economics of delivery orders more attractive and could help keep drive-through lines from getting off-puttingly long. But it does require careful thinking about how to allocate labor and tailor operations to make sure big-batch orders are given to customers fresh and hot.  Scrapping for Beer Cans: The widespread closure of bars across the U.S. and Europe in the spring hurt quarterly revenue for Molson Coors Beverage Co. to the tune of a 14.3% drop from a year earlier (adjusting for currency fluctuations). But its so-called off-premise business suffered in the U.S., too. CEO Gavin Hattersley said on a Thursday earnings call that while demand for party-friendly kegs all but vanished in this market, demand for 12-ounce cans “went through the roof.” That became an issue when the company struggled to get enough aluminum cans to keep up with this new consumer preference, and sales suffered as a result. The company is already doing the smartest thing it can to adapt, which is work with suppliers to ensure availability of the packaging materials needed to accommodate the stay-at-home lifestyle. We’re Staying Home This Year, Kids : U.S. tourism has suffered tremendously from the Covid-19 outbreak, creating headwinds for airlines, hotels, theme parks, restaurants, and even retailers such as Macy’s Inc. and Tiffany & Co., whose Manhattan flagships are magnets for out-of-towners. But the effects from this drop-off ripple even further. Executives of Carter’s Inc., the baby and kids’ clothing chain, said on a July 24 earnings call that sales at their stores in tourist-centric locations were down 20% from a year earlier upon reopening, while at non-tourist-centric locations, they were up 15%. Given that tourist-centric stores accounted for about 10% of its locations but 20% of its store sales last year, this represents a real obstacle for the apparel giant. Carter’s has no power to change global tourism trends, but it can try to offset those challenges in other ways, such as trumpeting its new curbside pickup offering and leaning more on its wholesale relationships with the likes of Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. – retailers that have remained extremely busy during the pandemic.These wide-ranging and somewhat idiosyncratic business situations illustrate how the pandemic is truly leaving no corner of the economy and our daily routines unchanged, right down to gum-chewing. And the situation is still playing out. More than ever, companies need to be tuned in enough to the latest trends to spot shifts as they are happening, and flexible enough to make quick adjustments. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-08-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When U.S. antitrust laws were first written more than a hundred years ago, the word “data” had a slightly different meaning, referring mainly to facts and manually-compiled information. You didn’t hear it much in everyday language, and it certainly wasn’t associated with trust-busting. In the digital world of today, it’s come to mean the measurable tidbits and inputs that add up to make every program and app — and thus much of the world’s economy — function. And the fact that it isn’t anywhere to be found in antitrust rules is a big problem.To have data is to have power, and collecting it is the lifeblood of four of the most valuable companies in America: Facebook Inc., Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Together, they are worth more than $5 trillion by market cap. That’s like adding up the market values of Walmart Inc., Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Procter & Gamble Co., Pfizer Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Nike Inc., McDonald’s Corp. and Walt Disney Co. — and then multiplying that sum by two. Calling it “Big Tech” doesn’t even do it justice.These leaders of social-media, online-search, e-commerce and smartphones are so embedded in consumers’ lives that it’s nearly impossible to avoid interacting with them on a given day and handing over reams of data, all for free, in the process: Checking emails, “liking” a post about Taylor Swift, clicking on an enchiladas recipe, joining a group for novice knitters, searching for bug spray and new eyeglass frames, looking up the UPS store’s hours and directions to it, downloading a fitness app and geo-tagging a selfie at the beach — innocuous activities that are meticulously tracked to build a profile of who you are and predict how you’ll spend your money.That power hasn’t gone unnoticed by regulators, Congress and other critics, many of whom wonder whether the companies’ dominance is a sign that current antitrust laws have come up short in regulating this relatively new industry. The answer is, they have — and that’s not all that surprising considering current laws were written with largely traditional businesses in mind, in which a tangible product or a service is built using suppliers and then sold to an end user. How Big Tech makes money can feel a bit more nebulous to an outsider, as well as who exactly is hurt by some of the industry’s practices. Their customers are advertisers and other large and small businesses. The product is, well, you.Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, appeared last Wednesday over video chat before a Congressional committee that’s investigating whether the industry has a monopoly problem. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining whether past acquisitions by these companies were anticompetitive. The industry doesn’t see it that way; when the members of Congress pointed to known instances of data misuse or overreach, the CEOs often chalked it up to one-offs or minor mishaps, rather than patterns of harmful business practice aimed at squelching competition. Where critics see an anticompetitive move, Big Tech sees a noble effort to improve service for consumers.It’s time that antitrust laws were updated so that regulators can better chaperone the industry — and its treasure trove of data — for it is both an immense intellectual and economic national asset and an opaque force with the power to capitalize on unknowing consumers and suppress rival businesses. Even with the best of intentions to create beneficial services that keep the world connected and informed, the result of Big Tech having such unchecked power over reams of valuable information has been to leave consumers and third-party partners comparatively powerless.Amassing so much data isn’t inherently anticompetitive — nor does it directly hit people’s wallets — but regulators need to look at how it’s collected and used and take action when competition is harmed in the process. Amazon makes for the simplest example of how it can become problematic: The company has been accused of using the highly detailed information it gathers from sellers on its marketplace to inform what products to make for its own private label, AmazonBasics, and to undercut the competition. That’s a major conflict of interest and an unfair advantage over third-party sellers, but there’s nothing those sellers can really do about it — Amazon is practically the only game in town. (Would any reasonable person consider Etsy Inc. or even EBay Inc. to be substitutes?) Bezos said using seller data to aid Amazon’s own brand would be a company violation, but he didn’t deny that it happens and said he’s looking into the issue.This type of accusation against Amazon is the clearest example of monopoly power. Others aren't so clear-cut. My colleague Tae Kim summarizes more of the complaints about the companies here and explains why issues around Google are particularly thorny. This is precisely where the U.S. antitrust framework gets tripped up by the digital-data industry. Take the U.S. guidelines on mergers, which state:A merger enhances market power if it is likely to encourage one or more firms to raise price, reduce output, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm customers as a result of diminished competitive constraints or incentives.Rising prices are the most obvious way mergers can be harmful. But small acquisitions by Big Tech tend to fall into that all-encompassing “otherwise harm” category described above. Facebook’s 2012 takeover of Instagram was harmful because it left social-media users with few alternatives, forcing them in effect to accept the company’s terms and further widening its lead over newcomer apps. Even if regulators couldn’t have predicted this at the time, it’s indisputable now that Facebook dominates social media and that spinning off Instagram would restore competition. (It would probably be good for shareholders, too, as Tae Kim has argued.)The FTC says that antitrust laws were intentionally written in general terms, allowing them to be broadly applied and interpreted in changing times on a case-by-case basis. But it may be that they are overly broad to the point of being antiquated, or at least not specific enough to effectively govern Big Tech. For example, the idea of “prices” should also include the price social-media users pay — the level of data they must fork over and the loss of control they have over that data. Another steep price that can be paid in the digital era is a privacy breach. Facebook’s controversies involving its data aren’t merely public-relations matters — they stem from competitive dominance and insufficient regulatory oversight.Antitrust enforcement also comes down to how regulators define markets. “In the absence of price competition, market definition can be difficult,” Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a November speech regarding the data industry. “Antitrust enforcers may need to play an even greater role in zero-price markets,” he said. Rather than a zero-price market, Google and Facebook would argue that they compete healthily in the $333 billion global digital-advertising space, with Amazon nipping at their heels in the U.S. and Apple’s devices serving as conduits. But the ad market provides an incomplete picture, and that framing implies these companies are merely a powerful foursome. Defining the market more narrowly — and more accurately — shows how each one has instead become a monopoly of sorts, having carved out its own silo with few, if any, true competitors.Advertisers may regularly adjust how much money to allocate to each site, but they generally need to be present on all of them. Facebook provides the ability to target ultra-specific subsets of people. Google isn’t just a search engine, it’s the primary verb people use for search, and it further feeds that dominance by scraping useful information from other pages, making its products priority destinations. For sellers of goods, Amazon’s marketplace offers the best reach. App developers don’t have much choice than to agree to the Apple app store’s onerous terms and fees. Consumers don’t pick and choose between these products and services either — they must use them all or accept life under a rock. Regulators would also be more effective if antitrust laws specified how data can be used and with what limitations, as well as requirements for safeguarding it. That would prevent Amazon from having such porous walls between its marketplace and internal brand. It could put an end to Google’s practice of paying to keep its search engine dominant and being able to direct so much traffic toward its own sites. Data should no longer be thought of as just an input for effective advertising, but rather the focal point of the question of whether Big Tech has too much power. If the answer is yes, and the remedy is creating an environment that would allow more Instagrams and Googles to flourish, wouldn’t everyone benefit? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-08-04,"Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved up to $132.85 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2021-01-15  * Strike Price: $115.00  * Volume: 634  * Open Interest: 52103 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * A Look Into Procter & Gamble's Debt(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-12,"Typically, investors consider consumer staple stocks as safe bets during economic slowdowns or recessions. The defensive nature of consumer staples and attractive dividends make them desirable during challenging times.Generally, consumer staples do not deliver spectacular sales growth rates. However, COVID-19 changed that for some companies like Clorox. Heightened focus on sanitizing and cleaning led to a major spike in Clorox’s sales. Procter & Gamble is another staples company that benefited from higher pandemic-led demand for some of its products.Using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we lined up the two staples alongside each other to see which stock offers the most compelling investment opportunity right now.Clorox (CLX)Clorox has been experiencing an unprecedented demand for its disinfecting and cleaning products since the COVID-19 outbreak. The company finished fiscal 2020 on a strong note with consumers stocking up its namesake Clorox bleach brand and other cleaning products to fight the pandemic. Despite additional capacity, many of the company’s products went out of stock due to the elevated demand.In the fiscal fourth quarter (April to June quarter), Clorox’s sales surged 22% year-over-year to $1.98 billion. The top line was supported by double-digit growth across all the four segments – Health and Wellness, Household, Lifestyle and International. The Health and Wellness segment’s sales were up 33%, driven by strong sales of cleaning products.The stay-at-home mandates helped in driving higher sales of bags and wraps as well as grilling products and led to a 17% increase in the Household segment’s sales. The Health and Wellness and Household segments together accounted for over 71% of Clorox’s fourth-quarter sales. Impressive fourth-quarter sales led to an EPS of $2.41, reflecting a 28.2% year-over-year growth. However, higher manufacturing and logistics costs as well as advertising investments were a drag on the bottom line.Increased cleaning and hygiene needs might continue to benefit Clorox. However, the rate of sales growth might not be as strong as that in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company’s fiscal 2020 sales and EPS grew by 8.2% and 16.5%, respectively. Clorox predicts a flat to low single-digit rise in its fiscal 2021 sales and a mid-single-digit decline to mid-single-digit growth in EPS.Clorox aims to boost its sales through innovation. Also, recent strategic partnerships with United Airlines, Uber Technologies, AMC Theaters and Cleveland Clinic to maintain safety protocols amid the pandemic are expected to further enhance sales.Clorox stock has gained 52% year-to-date. Despite robust sales momentum, several analysts are on the sidelines due to valuation concerns. Following the fiscal fourth-quarter results, Credit Suisse analyst Kaumil Gajrawala raised the price target for Clorox stock to $200 from $185 while maintaining a Neutral rating.He noted, “Clorox delivered a strong quarter behind continued elevated demand across its portfolio due to COVID-19. Capacity shortage, particularly in cleaning and disinfecting products, has been met with inventory drawdowns and new co-packers. Firm is investing aggressively behind its brands and increased production. This should support high rates of growth through the remainder of 2020 as consumption shows little signs of abating and inventories (both company and channel) still need to get replenished. Valuation keeps us on the sidelines.”Overall, Clorox has a Hold analyst consensus rating from the Street based on 2 Buys, 5 Holds and 2 Sells. The average price target of $223.33 implies a possible decline of 4.3% over the next year. (See Clorox stock analysis on TipRanks)Procter & Gamble (PG)Leading staples firm Procter & Gamble is recognized worldwide through several popular brands, including Ariel, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Pampers and Tide. Since the COVID-19 crisis, Procter & Gamble has been experiencing higher demand for categories like fabric care, home cleaning and dishwashing products, as well as baby, feminine and family care products. The company’s personal health care business also gained from pandemic-led demand.However, movement restrictions and travel disruptions to curb the virus have hurt the sales of some of the company’s beauty and grooming products. Overall, Procter & Gamble’s fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $17.7 billion were up 3.5% year-over-year. The fourth-quarter adjusted EPS grew by 5.5% to $1.16. Higher sales coupled with productivity savings drove the earnings growth.Summarizing fiscal 2020, the company’s sales and EPS rose 4.8% and 13.3%, respectively. Looking ahead, Procter & Gamble expects sales growth of 1% to 3% in fiscal 2021. It predicts fiscal 2021 adjusted EPS growth in the range of 3% to 7%. The company’s conservative guidance compared to fiscal 2020 reflects the impact of a challenging macro environment, the corona crisis and intense competition.Procter & Gamble stock has risen 7% year-to-date and several analysts raised their price target for PG following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter results. Berenberg Bank analyst James Targett upped his price target to $136 from $123.In a research note, he explained, “We understand investors’ current attraction to P&G due to its categories, balance sheet, buyback and dividend. These factors position it well into FY21. P&G is showing encouraging market share momentum (up 50bp globally in Q4), with higher shares online, and management again reiterated that P&G’s product offer is better positioned than in the previous recession.” However, the analyst maintained his Hold rating owing to “less exciting” valuation.Procter & Gamble has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating based on 8 Buys and 4 Holds. The Street’s average price target of $141.08 reflects an upside potential of 5.21% over the next 12-months. (See Procter & Gamble stock analysis on TipRanks)So which stock is better?Both Clorox and Procter & Gamble might continue to enjoy strong demand for certain categories, especially cleaning products, even when the pandemic fades. However, Wall Street consensus rating, upside potential and Clorox’s comparatively lofty valuation make Procter & Gamble a more compelling investment. Procter & Gamble’s current dividend yield of 2.36% compared to Clorox’s 1.90% also acts in its favor.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-17,"(Bloomberg) -- The relentless rally in Tesla Inc. shares has driven its valuation beyond consumer product behemoth Procter & Gamble Co., as investors bet on the electric vehicle maker’s ability to dominate the automotive market of the future.The stock closed up 11% at a record $1,835.64 in New York on Monday, despite reports of a drop in the registrations of Chinese-made Tesla cars in July. China is a key market for Tesla, and the Elon Musk company is ramping up production there after starting deliveries from its massive Shanghai plant around the beginning of the year.Tesla shares are now up 339% this year, fueled by growing anticipation that the company will be included in the S&P 500 Index. The carmaker’s plan to split its stock 5-for-1 to make shares more accessible for individual investors is also expected to drive up demand. Tesla was the eighth most popular stock on the Robinhood app on Monday, according to data from Robintrack.net.Meanwhile, Wall Street has warmed to the stock, as evidenced by a steady stream of upgrades and price target boosts. The latest came from Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who raised his target to $1,900 from $1,800, saying Tesla has seen strong demand in Europe and China so far in the third quarter, with the U.S. market softer.“The China growth story is worth at least $400 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this electric vehicle penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote. He kept his bull-case target at $2,500.Tesla’s market value is now around $342 billion, surpassing P&G’s $337 billion. The maker of Pampers and Crest is the 10th largest stock in the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg data. Walmart has the ninth largest market capitalization in the S&P 500 at $384 billion.(Updates stock move, valuations, changes headline)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Tesla Value Surpasses Consumer Giant P&G, Next Stop Walmart"

2020-08-27,"(Bloomberg) -- British e-commerce company The Hut Group Ltd. plans to sell 920 million pounds ($1.2 billion) of new shares in an initial public offering, breathing life into an IPO market that has seen little activity this year.Holders of existing shares also will reduce their stakes, the company said in a statement Thursday, without detailing the size of this portion of the offering. If the IPO proceeds, there will be a free float of at least 20% and an equity value of 4.5 billion pounds before any new capital is raised. At 920 million pounds, the listing would be the largest by a British company in London since online rail-ticketing company Trainline Plc debuted in June 2019.The offering includes a feature that’s unusual in the U.K.: The company is awarding its co-founder, Chief Executive Matthew Moulding, a so-called golden or founder share that will give him power to veto any hostile takeover attempt for three years. That wrinkle means The Hut Group doesn’t meet the corporate governance standards for a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, and thus is ineligible for inclusion in benchmark indexes such as the FTSE 100, according to the LSE.“We very much needed that founder share,” Moulding said in an interview, adding that company had received takeover interest from numerous parties. The news of the IPO also piqued such interest, he said, adding the company was focused on expanding into a “major, global player” rather than selling.Moulding said he was keen to keep the Manchester-based business headquartered and listed in the U.K., although founders of high-growth businesses often have headed to the U.S. in search of enhanced voting rights. Moulding said he doesn’t plan to sell any stock in the IPO and after the listing will own a 25.1% stake in the company, which operates websites including myprotein.com and Coggles.com that sell beauty and nutrition products.Because newly listed companies that employ multiclass voting share structures are excluded from many stock indexes, The Hut Group will miss out on flows from passive managers tracking those benchmarks.Still, the founding share hasn’t given investors any cause for concern in early-look meetings the company has held, Moulding said, adding that the IPO was “hugely covered with incredibly strong interest levels.”In another twist, shares in the listing will be sold at a fixed price. Most European IPOs are marketed with an initial price range for as long as two weeks, with bookrunners typically pricing the shares based on investor feedback a day before the listing.IPO activity has been hampered by the economic effect of the coronavirus pandemic and volatile markets. Only seven companies have managed to go public in London this year, a 65% drop on the same period in 2019 and the lowest since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The IPO market is slowly picking up pace, but the only companies that have been able to list are those that benefited from, or proved resilient to, the impact of virus-induced lockdowns.The Hut Group’s listing comes amid a boom in e-commerce fueled by Covid-19 restrictions. The trend has been especially pronounced in the U.K., an early leader in online sales that’s seen downtown shopping districts decimated by the shift.Accelerating GrowthThe company has been one of the country’s biggest digital success stories, drawing a visit from Prime Minister Boris Johnson during the general election campaign in December. Starting out as a white-label provider of e-commerce services in 2004, it now works with global brand owners such as Nestle SA and Procter & Gamble Co.The Hut Group said its growth has accelerated this year, with revenue climbing almost 36% to 676 million pounds in the first half, as the pandemic curbed sales in brick-and-mortar stores.The company has supplemented its business-to-business operations with its own beauty and sports-nutrition brands, including Lookfantastic. THG, as it’s known, employs more than 7,000 people, double the number four years ago.The Hut Group is adding about 2,000 employees a year and the pandemic hasn’t disrupted its plans, Moulding said. Most of its office staff are working from home, with employees going into the workplace twice a week, he said, adding that social-distancing measures have been in place in the company’s global distribution centers for much of the year.“Migration to online shopping, an expanding portfolio of products, and a growing, loyal customer base have historically helped THG to push its topline,” S&P Global Ratings said in a report before the pandemic struck. “We believe these factors will continue fueling trading momentum over the next few years.”Besides Moulding, the company’s shareholders include other members of management, Old Mutual Global Investors, funds managed by BlackRock Inc., Sofina, Merian Chrysalis Investment Co., Balderton and KKR & Co.Moulding was previously chief financial officer of 20:20 Mobile, the distribution division of telecommunications company Caudwell Group, where he served for eight years before its sale to private equity. He leads The Hut Group with its other co-founder, John Gallemore.JPMorgan Cazenove, Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Jefferies and Numis are arranging the deal.(Adds details on the company’s founder share, CEO comments)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",The Hut Group’s Planned $1.2 Billion IPO Breaks London Lull

Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Procter & Gamble's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q4, Procter & Gamble posted an ROCE of 0.07%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on PGReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.In Procter & Gamble's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q4 Earnings Insight Procter & Gamble reported Q4 earnings per share at $1.16/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.01/share.See more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-04,"Despite not including electrifying stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and therefore missing out on its historical gains, the Dow Jones Index still has quite a few winners under its umbrella. Although Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) had their worst-performing days since March yesterday, the drop was followed by their peers Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon. One bad day cannot erase the massive rally of these tech stocks which literally bloomed throughout the pandemic, or more precisely, the first two quarters of the year.Apple shares rose nearly 70% to date with the market value surpassing a $2 trillion market cap. Moreover, Apple is no longer dependent on its 'sacred cash cow', iPhone, as it showed it is successfully reshaping its business model to services. But even the iPhone is doing well, as Omdia's research showed that iPhone 11 was the most popular smartphone during the first half of 2020.Microsoft's latest revenue of $38 billion exceeded expectations of $35.5 billion. Earnings per share of $1.46 exceeded the estimate of $1.36. If we look at Intelligent Cloud alone, revenue amounted to $13.4 billion. The story of Microsoft's rebirth is greatly owed to its Intelligent Cloud business. During the fourth quarter, Intelligent Cloud brought in a revenue of $13.4 billion. This a 17% increase compared to the same quarter last year. If the pandemic has shown us anything is that tech is crucial for business resilience and faster recovery. Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA) also turned to Microsoft for its simplicity and seamless integration.Microsoft's gaming business also saw skyrocketing growth of 64%, amounting to 1.3 billion, as Xbox hardware revenue jumped 49%. The Xbox Series X is also coming in November. Microsoft has over a billion enterprise users and it can be found in nearly every enterprise of the planet. From early March to the end of April, Microsoft Teams grew from 11 million to over 75 million users. Users want systems that can work together without complexity and Microsoft delivered on that promise.Although AstraZeneca plc (NYSE: AZN) is the leader in the vaccine race, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) has ample financial resources along with an array of brands to boost its chances. Yesterday, Reuters reported that Johnson & Johnson announced its coronavirus vaccine prevented hamsters from getting severely ill. Although we need to wait for human trials to begin next month, this is something to be excited about. Its pharmaceutical segment still stood strong amid the devastating second quarter. Despite falling earnings, the company continued to pay dividends. Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend Aristocrat, a company that not only continuously pays dividends but also keeps increasing them. The bottom line is that it is diversified enough to survive the storm while also expecting to expand earnings for fiscal 2020 despite delivering losses in the second quarter.Despite the focus on performance chemicals, Dow Inc (NYSE: DOW) portfolio is actually quite diversified. During the second quarter, some of Dow's sales did suffer as it was the worst quarter of the year all over the globe. But despite plummeting sales of big items such as new homes, furniture, and cars, sales of cleaning and disinfecting products, which also use Dow's chemicals, increased. People started cooking at home, increasing the demand for food packaging. Professional construction chemical sales dropped, but do-it-yourself home improvement rose and pulled paints and coatings along. This diversified portfolio allowed Dow to outperform expectations. More importantly, it generated plenty of cash to fund its dividend.Pharma titan Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) and recently expelled from the Dow, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), appear to be two of the most evenly matched competitors in the pharmaceutical sector. But unlike Merck, Pfizer is limping besides the pandemic creating an opportunity for a vaccine. Merck also has two vaccine candidates. Chief executive Kenneth Frazier announced on Thursday that human testing is starting fairly soon. Over the last half of a decade, Merck's stock has consistently outperformed Pfizer's. Merck's value grew by 6% whereas Pfizer's dropped 3.1%.Over the next three years, Merck will invest $19 billion into expanding its oncology, vaccine, and animal health segments. Its cancer immunotherapy is expected to continue fueling its sales as Keytruda sales were 46% year-over-year.The Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) had its best fiscal year in more than a decade. Despite all of us being germ-conscious in this new pandemic era, we still have cravings such as donut and coffee. Procter & Gamble has already teamed up with Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (NASDAQ: DNKN) owned Dunkin' Donuts to promote the use of its cleaning products in restaurants, but it is looking for more partners with fast-food, hospitality, transportation and healthcare companies. At the end of the day, it's more than revenue- it's free publicity. Sales gains managed to beat management's target for the fourth consecutive quarter, and cash flow and profitability reached new highs. But most importantly, the outlook is even brighter with further market share expansion. Fiscal 2020 results are evidence that P&G can invest aggressively in growth strategies while still boosting profitability.So, there you have it. Big Tech, medical devices, pharmaceutical and consumer goods Dow winners of the pandemic. And there's no reason to doubt that the post-COVID era will be just as kind to them as they provided meaningful service and products that actually made a difference during these unprecedented circumstances.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

Picking the right stocks to invest in and use to build a sound portfolio can be a daunting task. This is especially true for people who are new to investing. However, there are a few rules that can help identify stocks to buy for beginners, and help new investors make overall smart choices.
These rules include “buy what you know” — or pick stocks of companies you understand. Choosing stocks of companies that have “strong fundamentals,” or solid balance sheets, is another rule. And, of course, “diversifying your investments,” or making sure that you don’t put all your eggs in one stock, is also an axiom to live by.


					7 Innovative Stocks Pushing Our World Ahead				

Here we look at seven excellent stocks to buy for beginners;:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)
Apple (NASDAQ:APPL)
Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B)
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG)
Costco (NASDAQ:COST)
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)
FedEx (NYSE:FDX)

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: Amazon (AMZN)
Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com

	
Online retail giant Amazon ticks all the boxes when it comes to investing rules. The company is a well-known brand that people understand and use in their daily lives — ordering everything from toilet paper to television sets online. The company has a solid balance sheet and is super profitable. And Amazon is an increasingly diverse company, branching out into everything from artificial intelligence to the streaming of movies and TV shows. Brands include Amazon Web Services, Whole Foods Market and Prime Video, to name a few.
The stock is not cheap by any means. At more than $3,000 a share, it is the most expensive security on this list. Nevertheless, AMZN is a solid growth stock for beginner investors.
Recently, Amazon has been expanding into cloud computing and focusing on developing its own content to compete in the streaming wars against the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu. But its bread-and-butter e-commerce business continues to go gangbusters and has gotten a boost during the pandemic as more people order goods online.
AMZN stock has essentially doubled from its March lows to $3,220 a share today. Again, not cheap, but definitely worth the price to add powerful growth to a portfolio.

Apple (APPL)
Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com

	
There is no bigger name in consumer technology than Apple. The company co-founded by Steve Jobs out of a garage in the 1970s has been responsible for many of the biggest consumer tech products developed over the past 45 years — from the Apple II and Macintosh computers to the iPod and iPhone. All investors are familiar with Apple and its highly visible products.
The company has a strong balance sheet and rock-solid business model. It also has a competitive advantage in most of the markets in which it has a presence, having effectively developed its own technological ecosystem with iPads and Apple Watches.
Not content to rest on its laurels, Apple is always pushing into new frontiers. Most recently, the company has focused on offering new services through products such as Apple Pay and Apple TV. These new products and services are increasing its cash flow and broadening the Apple brand. Streaming content through the subscription Apple TV+ service is another way that the company is diversifying its business.
AAPL stock has doubled from its March low and the company recently undertook a 4-for-1 stock split that now has its shares priced at $115 each. This makes them more affordable and attractive to individual retail investors. This is a stock that people can buy, hold and retire on.

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com

	
Investors are in trusted hands with Berkshire Hathaway. In fact, you’re in the hands of the most successful investor in history — Warren Buffett. And his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns a lot of different businesses and investments, from being the largest shareholder of Apple to owning the GEICO insurance company. Berkshire Hathaway has an impeccable track record of making smart acquisitions and investments.
Buffett’s buy-and-hold investment strategy has also proven to be unmatched in terms of its success. From 2008 to 2018, the company saw cumulative growth of 119.7%, compared to 73.2% growth for the S&P 500. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway has what is often called a “fortress balance sheet” that includes more than $120 billion in cash. The huge pile of cash allows the company to provide financing to other distressed companies at extremely favorable terms. While the company’s class A stock trades at $323,000 a share, new investors can purchase the company’s class B shares for $215 per share.
For new investors who may be uncertain of which stocks to buy, they can rest easy putting money into Berkshire Hathaway.

Procter & Gamble (PG)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com

	
In addition to profits, investors can also earn dividend payments from the stocks they hold in their portfolio. And one of the most stable and best paying dividend stocks is consumer goods company Procter & Gamble. Commonly known by the acronym P&G, the company has a strong track record of delivering exceptional dividends to shareholders.
In 2020, for example, Procter & Gamble raised its dividend for the 64th consecutive year, and this year marked the 130th consecutive year P&G has paid a dividend since incorporating way back in 1890. As of October 2020, P&G’s annual dividend payment is $3.16 a share for a dividend yield of 2.29%.
Another good reasons to buy PG stock is its many well-known consumer products ranging from Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent to Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste. Sales have gotten a boost during the pandemic as people have stocked up on essentials while sheltering in place at home. PG stock has risen 43% since the market crash in March and now trades at $140 a share.

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: Costco (COST)
Source: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com

	
Grocery retailer Costco is a simple but powerful business that is familiar to most Americans. The company’s warehouse setting and wholesale pricing have revolutionized the retail sector and changed the way people shop and consume food.
While its approach has been replicated, Costco retains a competitive edge and commands huge brand loyalty among consumers. These facts make the company a worthwhile investment, especially beginners who want a stock they know and understand.
Like other companies on this list, Costco has seen a bump in sales during the Covid-19 pandemic as people spend more to stock up on food and other essentials. In addition, Costco has been growing its online sales. E-commerce sales nearly doubled, rising 90% in the quarter ended Aug. 30. Online sales represent a huge and growing source of revenue for the retailer. That said, Costco continues to open brick-and-mortar stores, planning to open nine new locations by the end of 2020 — six in the U.S. and three in Canada.
Costco stock has increased 500% since 2010 and is up roughly 40% from its March low to $367.

McDonald’s (MCD)
Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com

	
The Golden Arches is a good investment in good times and bad. Despite intense competition, McDonald’s remains the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain with nearly 40,000 locations in 100 countries. And while the company’s dine-in restaurants closed during the pandemic, its drive-thru windows remained open, helping to keep revenue buoyant.
The company also continues to experiment with its menu and change things up with the food and beverage offerings. McDonald’s café that serves a variety of coffees, cookies and muffins has proven to be a hit with the public.
MCD stock has been on an uptrend recently following an analyst upgrade by Bank of America, which raised its 12-month price target on the stock to $250 a share. McDonald’s stock currently trades at $225 a share and has increased 64% since its March bottom.
Going forward, McDonald’s has a new CEO and is testing out delivery services and plant-based burgers. This is a company and stock that is both familiar and innovative, giving it plenty of growth potential for investors.

Stocks to Buy for Beginners: FedEx (FDX)
Source: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com

	
You can count on Federal Express, and not just to deliver packages to your house or business. The company also delivers for shareholders. FDX stock has been a major outperformer in recent months, more than doubling since March when shares were trading at $90. Today, the stock is changing hands for $271 per share.
The reality is that the Covid-19 pandemic has been a massive accelerator for the private delivery company as people and businesses order and ship a growing number of products. The company’s most recent quarterly results handily beat analysts’ expectations.
Moving through the final quarter of the year, FedEx expects to see a further boost to its business during the busy holiday shopping season as people avoid malls in favor of ordering gifts online. Indeed, demand shows no signs of slowing down and FedEx is successfully fending off competition from rivals such as Amazon. For beginner investors, FDX is a solid blue-chip stock with enormous growth potential. The company is also a trusted and established brand that does one thing and does it extremely well — deliveries.
On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL, BRK.B, BAC, MCD and FDX.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily.

2020-10-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Procter & Gamble Co.’s shareholders approved a proposal that the maker of Charmin toilet paper publish a report on its efforts to halt deforestation amid pressure from environmentalists.The vote at the shareholder meeting Tuesday went against a recommendation from P&G’s board of directors that investors reject the measure, which was proposed by Green Century Equity Fund. P&G’s toilet paper and tissue sourcing has come under fire by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, and other forestry advocates, which say the company’s production practices contribute to climate change.“It’s a clear call from investors that P&G needs to do more to protect forests,” said Shelley Vinyard, who manages the NRDC’s campaign to curb deforestation in Canada.Environmentalists are scrutinizing P&G’s manufacturing for its reliance on carbon-rich trees from Canada’s Northern Boreal Forest. P&G says its practices are sustainable and that a tree is planted for every one that is cut down, while groups like the NRDC say this isn’t enough to compensate for clear cutting. The battle has intensified after consumer stockpiling during the pandemic led to record-breaking toilet paper sales.Prior to the vote, P&G Chief Executive Officer David Taylor defended the company’s practices, saying the company is “a leader not a laggard” on sustainability. He also said the company has to find ways to balance consumer demand for softer, premium tissue with sustainability questions.Climate PressureThe shareholder vote is a signal that even the biggest companies are facing growing pressure on climate-related issues. In addition to Green Century Equity Fund, BlackRock Inc. said it supported the proposal. With 6.6% of P&G’s shares as of June 30, BlackRock is the company’s second-largest investor. The timing of the deforestation report will be decided by executives and the board of directors, the company said. In the report, P&G would assess “if and how it could increase the scale, pace and rigor of its efforts to eliminate deforestation and the degradation of intact forests in its supply chains,” according to the company’s proxy statement.Competitor Kimberly-Clark Corp. has revamped its climate goals to address its sourcing. The company has said it will reduce its sourcing of wood fibers from forests such as the Boreal by 50% by 2025. Consumer staples companies have benefited this year amid consumer stockpiling. P&G shares rose 15% this year through Tuesday’s close, while Kimberly-Clark shares gained 12%. Both have outpaced the advance of the S&P 500 Index. Green Century Shareholder Advocate Jessye Waxman said it’s imperative for companies to adopt ambitious environmental commitments.“P&G leadership should heed this clear call to increase its efforts to mitigate deforestation,” Waxman said.(Updates to include share performance in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",P&G Holders Rebuke Board With Vote for Deforestation Report

P&G's growth was led by higher sales volumes, but average prices also rose.",Procter & Gamble Raises Its Outlook After a Strong Q1
2020-10-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Companies ranging from industrial majors to consumer heavyweights boosted their full-year guidance Tuesday, pointing to earnings strength despite the pandemic -- and in some cases, because of it.At least seven companies raised their forecasts before market opened, including aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp., consumer-products company Procter & Gamble Co., Philip Morris International Inc. and Prologis Inc. Although only 67 companies in the S&P 500 companies have reported third-quarter earnings, so far the trend is positive, with more than 80% beating estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The results helped lift U.S. stocks, which also got a boost from hope for a stimulus deal before the Nov. 3 election. The S&P 500 has recovered all the losses triggered by the pandemic, though it’s pulled back from last month’s record close amid concern about rising coronavirus case numbers and further economic fallout.Among the companies that reported Tuesday morning, Procter & Gamble Co. rallied the most in six weeks, while Lockheed Martin and Philip Morris slipped.F-35 jet maker Lockheed Martin Corp. boosted its full-year earnings per share and sales guidance even as the U.S. government, its biggest customer, runs a record deficit due to pandemic-related spending.Procter & Gamble was the most obvious beneficiary of people spending more time at home. The consumer giant reported its best organic sales growth since 2005. The maker of Charmin toilet paper and Tide detergent also raised its revenue growth outlook to a range of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year that ends in June 2021.“This isn’t a flash in the pan,” Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told Bloomberg. “I don’t see any reason that we shouldn’t be able to sustain strong results.”Philip Morris also boosted its full-year earnings guidance for the second time in recent months despite a nearly 10% drop in cigarette volumes in the third quarter. Its IQOS tobacco-heating device saw a 19% surge in sales in the quarter, indicating growing consumer appetite for cigarette substitutes.What Bloomberg Intelligence says:The early part of 3Q earnings season looks a whole lot like 2Q with extremely high and widespread beats, confirmed by stronger-than-expected revenue growth as S&P 500 companies shake off the pandemic-fueled recession. The second straight quarter of record beats doesn’t seem to have inspired much confidence, though, as price reactions have been negative and forecasts remain stagnant.Though only about a 10th of S&P 500 companies have reported so far, 84% have exceeded EPS estimates, the highest rate in 30 years of BI data, Martin Adams said. Almost all sectors are showing positive estimate momentum for 3Q earnings, suggesting analysts were likely caught off guard by the recovery in the period.&#92;-- Gina Martin Adams, Chief Equities StrategistKey Developments:U.S. futures trimmed gains after reports that federal prosecutors will file an antitrust lawsuit against Google.Traders are backing away from bets on chaos after the Nov. 3 elections.The U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc.’s Google, accusing it of abusing its monopoly in search.Analysts expect Netflix Inc. to report 3.32 million new subscribers in the third quarter after markets close Tuesday.Here’s today’s top earnings news by sector:ConsumerProcter & Gamble raised its outlook after posting its best organic sales growth since 2005 amid a boom in at-home consumption of toilet paper and cleaning supplies. The maker of Tide detergent and Dawn dish soap now sees organic revenue growing 4% to 5% in fiscal 2021, an increase from the previous outlook of 2% to 4%. Shares rose as much 2.7%.Albertsons rose as much as 7.4%, the most on record, after virus-wary Americans cooking at home led to another jump in sales growth. Identical-store sales, a key gauge of a retailer’s health, climbed 13.8% for the three months ended Sept. 12. The supermarket chain sees that metric for the full fiscal year coming in at 15.5% or more.Philip Morris raised its earnings forecast a second time and said that smoke-free products such as IQOS expanded to reach a quarter of total revenue. Cigarette volumes fell 9.8%, less than analysts expected, and an outperformance in markets such as the European Union led the company to raise the forecast a month after the last increase. The stock was down 0.3 in early trading.AMC Entertainment sank almost 12% after the cinema chain reported preliminary third-quarter revenue of $119.5 million, below analysts’ consensus estimate of $163 million as compiled by Bloomberg. The company also agreed to sell as many as 15 million shares of its stock to contend with a liquidity crisis that threatens its ability to remain a going concern.InsuranceTravelers rose more than 3% after posting better underwriting results in the third quarter while also benefiting from a rebound in markets that took hold after an initial pandemic-induced slump. The insurer reported a record quarter for premium revenue and a 7.9% gain in its investment portfolio. However, Travelers was stung by Mother Nature in the quarter with catastrophe costs totaling $397 million before taxes, up 65% from a year earlier.IndustrialsLockheed Martin boosted its earnings per share and net sales forecasts for the full year. The defense company also beat estimates for net sales for the period. The stock was trading little changed after falling as much as 0.9%.Paccar shares swung between gains and losses after its third-quarter net sales and revenue topped analysts’ expectations. The truck manufacturer estimates that it will invest between $575 million and $625 million in capital projects next year.Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.’s forecast for capital expenditures for the full year met analysts’ expectations.

Organic sales came in a bit stronger than expected at 3%.",Kimberly-Clark Loses Ground to P&G in Q3
2020-10-23,"On Tuesday, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) managed to beat estimates and raised forecast amid strong demand for its household products. Its shares rose 2% in morning trading.Key figures Fiscal first-quarter sales rose 9% as the pandemic fuelled higher demand for cleaning and laundry products, exceeding the prior quarter's 6% increase. Net sales amounted to $19.32 billion, topping expectations of $18.38 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, also rose 9% in the quarter. This sales boost was enabled by stronger demand in P&G's largest market, North America.Sales growth resulted in a net income of $4.28 billion, or $1.63 per share. Not only is this figure higher than Refinitiv's average of $1.42 per share, but it is also an improvement from last year's $3.59 billion, or $1.36 per share, a year earlier.Improved Forecast Supported by these strong quarter results, P&G also raised its outlook for fiscal 2021. Overall sales growth is now expected in the range between 3% to 4%, up from its prior forecast of 1% to 3%. As for organic revenue, the forecasted range also improved from 2% to 4% to a new range between 4% and 5%. The outlook for its core earnings per share growth has also improved from the prior forecast of 3% to 7%. While the early retirement of debt will reduce its net income up to 20 cents a share this fiscal year, core earnings per share are still forecasted to grow between 5% to 8%. As for the impact of after-tax foreign exchange impacts and freight costs, they are estimated to impact earnings at approximately $375 million.The ""antiseptic"" cleaning boom Although the laundry care and healthcare divisions were standout performers as consumers prioritized home cleaning spending, all of P&G's five business segments enjoyed organic sales growth. Moreover, U.S. consumers did not opt for cheaper brands which were expected to the absence of a new stimulus package.Fabric and home care, which includes Tide, saw the highest jump. Organic sales rose 14% in the quarter. The home care segment alone saw organic sales soar 30% due to a boost in demand for home cleaning products, like Mr. Clean.Health care, which includes Oral-B,s saw a double-digit organic sales growth as more consumers bought its digestive and wellness products.View more earnings on PGIts beauty segment saw organic sales growth of 7% with the launch of Safeguard hand soap and hand sanitizer as well as new products from Olay that lifted North American sales for skin and personal care. It's already a known fact that skincare became the new ""lipstick index"" during the COVID-19 pandemic.Organic sales for its grooming business rose 6% in the quarter. However, Gillette and Venus brands saw flat organic sales as men don't appear to be shaving as much during the pandemic. But women's razors and blades rose by single digits.The company's baby, health and family care segment reported organic sales growth of 4%, including Pampers diapers, paper towels and toilet paper.Outlook It didn't take long for Procter & Gamble to leave its conservative fiscal 2021 outlook behind. As consumers spend more time in their households, watching TV and engaging with their social media profiles, P&G is putting more money into advertising to put its brands front and center. The overall image is that P&G's strong results and growth were enabled by increase in sales volumes, but average prices also rose. P&G did a great job in catching the cleaning boom wave which is why the company expects only a modest slowdown from pandemic-influenced growth rates that result in spiking sales over the recent months.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-10-28,"Consumer staples stocks are generally considered a safer bet amid challenging economic conditions due to the non-cyclical nature of goods like food, cleaning products and personal care items sold by companies in this sector. Also, these stocks are preferred by income investors for their consistent dividends and attractive dividend yields.After experiencing a major spike in the demand for their goods due to stockpiling amid lockdowns, many consumer staple companies are now seeing a moderated sales growth rate. Keeping these changing trends in mind, we will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to compare Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble to see which consumer staples stock offers a better investment opportunity.Kimberly-Clark (KMB)Sales of Kimberly Clark, which is well-known for its brands like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex and Scott, have been quite lackluster in recent years amid rising competition. In 2019, sales were almost flat at $18.5 billion. Panic-buying in the initial phase of the pandemic drove an 8% rise in Kimberly-Clark’s 1Q sales. However, 3Q sales grew 0.9% Y/Y to $4.68 billion, indicating that demand is returning to normal levels.Organic sales growth in 3Q was 3% while adjusted EPS declined 6.5% to $1.72 due to higher expenses. The company’s Consumer Tissue segment continued to benefit from pandemic-led demand in 3Q and delivered organic sales growth of 10%. The Personal Care segment’s organic sales growth was 5%. However, organic sales of K-C Professional segment were down 15% as sales to enterprises were impacted by the work from home arrangements.Meanwhile, Kimberly Clark is trying to improve its sales through innovation with an emphasis on premium products. For instance, last year the company launched its most premium diaper in the US—Huggies Special Delivery, which comprises naturally sourced materials.The company sees significant growth prospects in the international markets, especially in developing and emerging economies. Recently, it acquired Softex Indonesia for $1.2 billion in line with its efforts to accelerate its growth in the personal care category in developing and emerging markets. As per the company, Indonesia’s diaper market is the sixth largest globally and is projected to nearly triple in size over the next decade.To improve profitability, Kimberly-Clark initiated a restructuring program in 2018 that aims to reduce its cost base by cutting down overheads and streamlining its supply chain. The company plans to close or sell about ten manufacturing facilities while expanding production capacity at some plants. Kimberly-Clark also intends to exit or divest some lower-margin businesses that contribute about 1% of the company’s overall sales.As part of the restructuring program, Kimberly-Clark is also reducing its workforce by 5,000 to 5,500. The program is expected to be completed next year and generate cost savings in the range of $500 million to $550 million. The company is also pursuing its FORCE program to optimize its end-to-end supply chain.Kimberly-Clark raised its full-year guidance following the 3Q performance and now expects organic sales growth of 5% and adjusted EPS growth in the range of 9% to 11%. (See KMB stock analysis on TipRanks)In reaction to the recent results, Berenberg Bank analyst Fulvio Cazzol reiterated a Buy rating for Kimberly-Clark but lowered his price target to $177 from $181. He commented “We believe the lfl [like-for-like] sales slowdown for KC in 2021 could be less severe than the market expects. Visible Alpha expectations for 0.4% group organic sales growth in 2021 are too conservative (we forecast 1.4%).”“In addition, improved execution, supported by higher investments and more agile operations, will underpin a higher market share performance in 2021 and beyond.”The rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about Kimberly-Clark. A Moderate Buy consensus is based on 3 Buys, 4 Holds and 1 Sell. With shares down 2% so far in 2020, the average analyst price target of $158.50 suggests a possible upside of 17.6% in the coming months.Procter & Gamble (PG)With brands like Tide, Gillette, Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Ariel and Pampers, Procter & Gamble has a strong presence in about 180 countries. Unlike many of its peers who are now experiencing moderated sales growth after the stockpiling phenomena amid lockdowns, consumer staples giant Procter & Gamble continues to enjoy robust demand as demonstrated by its recent results.The company’s 1Q FY21 (ended Sep. 30) sales grew 8.5% Y/Y to $19.3 billion. Organic sales growth was 9% and reflected further strength compared to a growth of 6% in 4Q FY20.Moreover, the company experienced sales and volume growth across all its key divisions in 1Q. Notably, Health Care and Fabric & Home Care divisions generated organic sales growth of 12% and 14%, respectively. Overall, robust sales growth and productivity cost savings helped in driving a 19% growth in 1Q FY21 EPS to $1.63 on an adjusted basis.Following the impressive 1Q performance, Procter & Gamble raised its full-year outlook and now expects sales growth between 3%-4% and adjusted EPS growth in the range of 5%-8% in FY21. (See PG stock analysis on TipRanks)Aggressive marketing and continued innovation are major aspects of Procter & Gamble’s growth strategy and are helping in gaining additional market share in key categories. Also, e-commerce growth is a vital part of the company’s strategic plans, especially amid the pandemic. In 1Q FY21, e-commerce sales grew 50% and accounted for 11% to 12% of the overall sales.Further, under its current productivity and cost savings plan, the company is reducing costs in its supply chain, certain marketing activities and also bringing down overhead expenses. It recorded $1.5 billion pre-tax restructuring costs in FY20 and expects to incur restructuring costs in the range of $250 million to $500 million in FY21.Meanwhile, Berenberg analyst Fulvio Cazzol increased his price target for Procter & Gamble to $156 from $149 after 1Q results. However, he reiterated a Hold rating, saying that further upgrades to the guidance are already priced in. The analyst expects more upgrades to the management guidance based on “Based on 1) a strong start to the year, and importantly a more diversified growth profile; 2) better-than-expected productivity, which is likely to be reinvested to support future growth; and 3) a strong execution track record.”Turning to the rest of the Street, the Moderate Buy consensus breaks down into 9 Buys versus 4 Holds. With shares already rising 14% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $153.46 implies further upside potential of 7.8%.The Better BuyBoth Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark are known for their consistent dividends. Currently, Procter & Gamble’s dividend yield of 2.22% is lower than Kimberly-Clark’s yield of 3.13%.If we look at the most recently reported results, then Procter & Gamble definitely fared better than Kimberly-Clark and appears poised for strong long-term growth. However, taking into account more upside potential, lower valuation and a higher dividend yield, Kimberly-Clark would seem to be the better stock pick than Procter & Gamble currently.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-11-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.S. economy is badly wounded, and shoppers’ behavior remains cautious and unpredictable. The turbulent times, though, have created breakout moments for some stars of the consumer startup universe. Food-delivery heavyweight DoorDash Inc. filed for an initial public offering on Friday, signaling a new chapter in its corporate life not long after raising $400 million in a private fundraising round. Instacart, a grocery-delivery app, is reportedly preparing an IPO at an eye-popping $30 billion valuation on the heels of a $200 million financing round it announced in October. These familiar names were hardly alone in getting a vote of confidence this year from venture capitalists. It turns out, 2020 is shaping up to be one of the best times ever for consumer startups. Deals and financing for such companies totaled more than $6.6 billion in the third quarter, according to CB Insights. Funding for the full year is projected to reach nearly $18 billion, an all-time high. Some of that reflects splashy deals by unicorns, such as when plant-based milk maker Oatly AB of Sweden raised $200 million this summer from investors including celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z. But CB Insights tallied 414 deals in the sector for the quarter, not far off the average number of quarterly deals in recent years, showing the spoils aren’t going to an unusually small coterie of stars.  I was initially surprised this activity hadn’t been frozen up by the pandemic. Sure, insurgents like DoorDash and Instacart have benefited, by nature of their focus on catering to those at home. But I assumed other factors would give investors pause about a wider basket of consumer businesses. Wouldn’t they be put off by the pile-up of store closures and bankruptcies the retail world has seen in recent months? Or deterred by comments from Procter & Gamble Co. executives and others in the industry about consumers returning to big, trusted brands? Didn’t they see a warning in the IPO flop of Casper Sleep Inc.? That’s only part of the reality, though. While the pandemic has sped up the decline of some already-struggling retail chains, it has also acted as an accelerant for many of the trends startup founders and venture-capital investors have been betting on. People were already embracing casual dressing and athleisure styles before stay-at-home living made sweatpants a daily uniform. That was surely a helpful backdrop for Allbirds, the sneaker unicorn that announced a $100 million fundraising round in September and has recently added clothing to its line-up.Health and wellness is another area that was a growing focus for consumers even before the public-health crisis offered a reason to rethink self-care routines and develop coping strategies. Now, the growing attention to this area could be a boon for fitness startups such as Tonal or a meditation app such as Calm, which Bloomberg News reported in October was exploring a fundraising round at double its 2019 valuation. In these cases, it’s not like venture capitalists need to revamp their investment theses, they simply need to reassess a timeline for them to play out. And many of them have ample capital to deploy. In some instances, the pandemic has cast existing consumer trends in a different light. Meat substitutes, for instance, were already making their way onto chain-restaurant menus and grocery store shelves as plant-centric diets become more popular. Then, in the early days of the pandemic, meat shortages demonstrated the vulnerabilities of that sector’s supply chain, giving investors more reason to back alternative protein makers such as Impossible Foods, which announced a $200 million fundraising round in August. It’s a cliche that startups must look for “white space,” and the pandemic has certainly created some, with incumbent retailers closing thousands of stores and packaged-goods brands dumping unproductive items. The disappearance of familiar stores and products leaves consumers no choice but to reconsider their previously autopilot shopping routines. That could work out well for newcomers, especially those that are tailored to e-commerce and offer some sort of feel-good component, like being made from sustainable materials. Kirsten Green, managing partner at Forerunner Ventures, said some consumers appear to be “buying less, but they’re buying better,” as stay-at-home living nudges them to be more thoughtful about purchasing, right down to how much packaging is needed for their online orders. The key challenge for consumer startups is navigating the more subtle ways that the world of dealmaking has shifted since the pandemic began. Caitlin Strandberg, a principal investor at Lerer Hippeau, said deals are happening especially fast right now – in part because it’s a highly competitive environment, but also because the rise of virtual meetings means everyone can simply cram that many more confabs into a day without getting on a plane. And she said the transformed shopping environment shapes what she listens for in a pitch. Amid the surge in online shopping, “the Amazon question has become even more important,” she said, referring to the decision of whether to sell on its website or not. The pandemic has rattled consumer demand and shopping patterns in a way that has flattened many incumbents. But it also has opened the door even wider for startups. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-11-16,"Shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) increased by 6.10% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Procter & Gamble has.Procter & Gamble's Debt Based on Procter & Gamble's financial statement as of October 20, 2020, long-term debt is at $23.95 billion and current debt is at $7.71 billion, amounting to $31.66 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $13.39 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $18.26 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Procter & Gamble has $119.90 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.26. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc., Elon Musk’s 17-year-old upstart carmaker, took a giant step toward blue-chip respectability, getting named to one of the world’s most famous stock indexes in an action that will greatly broaden its investor base.The announcement on Monday that Tesla will enter the S&P 500 on Dec. 21 follows months of speculation, and one temporary setback, after the stock failed to make the cut during the index’s quarterly rebalancing in early September. The anticipation has helped drive a nearly fivefold rally in the stock this year to almost $390 billion, making the electric vehicle pioneer the biggest company ever to be added to the gauge. It will also be one of the index’s most influential constituents with a weighting that falls around those of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble Co.It’s so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices said it is seeking feedback from the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once or in two separate pieces. The company that Tesla is to replace in the index will be named later, the index provider said.Tesla shares jumped 13% in early trading Tuesday to $460 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York. The stock is up about 450% this year.The news of S&P 500 inclusion “will of course likely drive a rally in the stock today,” JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha wrote in a note to clients before the market opening. “We think there is still upside,” he said, adding that Tesla should be valued like other “category killer” companies such as Apple Inc., instead of compared with other car companies. Osha reiterated his market outperform rating and price target of $516. “This was a little unexpected happy day for me,” said Ross Gerber, chief executive officer at Gerber Kawasaki Inc. Tesla is the top holding for the Santa Monica, California-based wealth management firm, with approximately 130,000 shares worth about $55 million as of Monday’s close.After analyzing the index just last week, “it was just kind of mind blowing that Tesla still wasn’t in the S&P,” Gerber said in a telephone interview. “So sure enough, here it is.”While entry into the benchmark is a rite of maturity that may dim some of Tesla’s cult stock appeal, membership comes with benefits, including forced purchases by index-tracking investors and mutual funds. The inclusion and the rapid rally over the past few months mean money managers overseeing passive funds will have to sell tens of billions of dollars worth of shares in their existing S&P holdings to make room for Palo Alto, California-based Tesla. On the other hand, longtime investors looking to exit their positions may now try to get out, knowing that index funds have to buy.These crosscurrents may mean more trading volatility, though that is not new for Tesla. Ever since going public in 2010, the company’s popularity with Musk acolytes and legions of day traders has made it one of the more volatile stocks of its size in America. A steadier, more institutional ownership base could help to eventually ease those swings.Unorthodox StyleTesla has solidified its position as the leading electric carmaker globally, even though competition is slowly heating up. It has overcome challenges including sometimes-severe production snarls, a massive cash burn rate and concerns about the demand for battery-powered vehicles in an industry dominated by gas-powered cars. In mid-September, Tesla reported a fifth consecutive quarterly profit, quieting critics who questioned its ability to make money.Indeed, all it had taken was Musk hinting at the second-quarter profit -- the company’s fourth consecutive profitable quarter -- in a letter to employees in late June to trigger a 66% surge in the stock over a span of 17 trading days, since the results checked off the last requirement for S&P 500 inclusion.Tesla’s sky-high share price also prompted a 5-for-1 stock split, a move aimed at making it more accessible to individual investors. The shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on Aug. 31.“We believe the sustained profitability trajectory as evidenced in the September quarter was the final straw that got Musk & Co. into the S&P 500 this time around,” Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors. He has a neutral rating on the stock.Joining one of the world’s most exclusive clubs is a validation for Musk and his unorthodox management style. His chief lieutenants are little known and rarely made available to the media or investors, and Musk courts controversy like few other corporate captains. He has picked fights with securities analysts, smoked marijuana during an interview and been sued for fraud by securities regulators for tweets claiming he had “funding secured” to take the company private.He also has complained more than once that Tesla’s stock price is too high. But that hasn’t deterred investors.Tesla has tapped into that investor goodwill with multiple secondary share offerings over the past decade, raising $14 billion through February and another $5 billion in September. That’s helped it fund new vehicle development and rapidly expand manufacturing capacity.Global AspirationsMusk’s latest mission is to make Tesla more of a global player in markets such as Asia and Europe. The automaker recently opened a plant in Shanghai and is building a factory in Berlin, which Musk visited last week for meetings with local officials. Tesla also has a second U.S. plant under construction near Austin, Texas, which is expected to expand the company’s model range to include a pickup called the Cybertruck.Musk is intent on cementing first-mover advantage in the market for EVs as the entire auto industry shifts to embrace electric powertrains, and his company’s valuation has topped Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co. combined.While Tesla is being rewarded by investors for dominating the global electric-car market, demand is still a small fraction of new vehicle sales -- amounting to less than 3% of U.S. sales last year. That presents plenty of growth opportunity, but illustrates the challenge of making battery-powered cars more of a mainstream choice.Still, the company’s recent success and its burgeoning valuation has also forced a spotlight on the entire electric vehicle space, sparking a surge in shares of several new entrants, some of whom still have a ways to go before production begins. Shares of China’s Nio Inc. rose 44% in October, and the company currently commands a market value that is bigger than GM.(Updates with opening shares Tuesday in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Tesla to Join S&P 500 Next Month as Largest-Ever New Member

2020-12-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. released one product and unveiled another designed to warehouse, analyze and keep track of data, taking on Amazon.com Inc. and Snowflake Inc. in a growing market for cloud-based tools that help companies do more with reams of information. Microsoft widely released its Azure Synapse Analytics tool and announced a preview of a new product called Purview, which is meant to help companies keep up with data security and compliance needs. ABN Amro Bank NV is using Synapse to figure out what financial services products are best targeted at which customers, and Wolters Kluwer NV, which helps develop medical software, built an artificial intelligence system that better predicts which patients will get a rapidly spread hospital-borne infection. Companies like FedEx Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. are also using the new software, Jason Zander, Azure executive vice president, said in an interview. Too many customers aren’t able to effectively use the data generated from a variety of different programs and devices, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella will tell customers Thursday at a virtual event. “Today, we are generating data faster than we are able to understand it,” Nadella will say, according to prepared remarks provided by Microsoft. “It’s relegated to internal and external silos or simply ignored.” Half of Fortune 1,000 executives say they don’t treat their data as a “business asset. It’s not because they don’t think it matters. They just don’t have the process or capability to get there.”Azure Purview adds data governance, security and compliance features. The service lets users find confidential data and allows executives responsible for securing it to get a high level view of all the information in various programs, including those from rivals like Amazon and SAP SE, Zander said. Microsoft’s new products come as the market for such tools is heating up, part of why Snowflake’s September initial public offering hit a record for a software company and was the biggest in the U.S. this year. Amazon’s AWS cloud unit has been improving its Redshift data warehouse. The market for cloud data management services will be worth $13 billion next year, according to estimates from Forrester, as customers try to make sense of information that’s stored in the cloud, corporate data centers and devices disbursed around offices, factories and other sites. “There's been this no-man’s land between where the data sits and how you are using the data,” said Michele Goetz, an analyst at Forrester. “There’s a lot that needs to be done to transform the data into something that’s usable and contextual.”Microsoft’s own finance department saw the need for these tools. When staffers had to locate some sort of information or insight, 70% of time they had to manually collect data— before the company introduced its new tools.“It was pretty demoralizing,” said Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood in a video that will be shown at the event. “You have great talent and you want to make a difference and instead they’re spending time explaining to me how much time they spent in cut, copy and paste.”Now the finance team has combined 120 different data sources in Azure, which also cut costs. The ability to better see all the information let Hood’s team improve financial forecasting. “We were OK at it — we weren’t great at it,” she said about their work before using the new products. After, her team cut the variance of forecasts in half. “People may say, gosh is that lot? Well going from 3% to 1.5% is the difference frankly between being right and being wrong and saving hundreds of millions of dollars,” she said.Some of the technology also came from the work Microsoft did to comply with European data privacy regulations, Zander said.“We built out all of these custom tools and work in order to handle exabytes of data,” Zander said. “We're taking all that technology that we use ourselves and making it available to our customers.”The new products and the focus on data management will also intensify competition with companies like SAP, Salesforce.com Inc. and Oracle Corp., Goetz said.

2020-12-09,"Earlier this week, Wells Fargo initiated coverage of a handful of household products. Chris Carey initiated or transferred coverage of the following stocks:Coty Inc (NYSE: COTY): downgraded from Equal-Weight to Underweight with a price target lifted from $4 to $5.Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL): initiated at Underweight, $80 price target.Clorox Co (NYSE: CLX): initiated at Overweight, $250 price target.Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG): initiated at Overweight, $160 price target.Coty: Valuation Concerns: Coty's stock is expensive after gaining 150% in the past six months and implies a valuation of around 38 times 2021 estimated EPS and 21 times 2022 estimated EPS, Carey said in the downgrade note.This is not only ""historically expensive"" versus the stock's average multiples but a 50%/8% premium to the home and personal care group and an even larger 64%/24% premium to the S&P 500 index, the analyst said. The stock's recent momentum followed the company's first-quarter report, whichshowed a strong operating profit beat.The company missed on the top line, and organic sales fell more than expected, he said. ""The only way we see for COTY to drive a sustainable turn in profit and work into its now historically high multiple is sales growth.""Related Link: Wells Fargo Taps Coca Cola, Monster In The Beverage Stock RaceTough Decisions Ahead For Colgate-Palmolive: Colgate's management faces ""tough decisions"" ahead, and no outcome necessarily bodes well for the stock, Carey said.First, management can sustain near peak ad spend and risk margin upside if the top-line deleverages on more normalized category growth, the analyst said. Second, management could cut ad spend to protect margins at the expense of losing sales, he said. Despite an uncertain path ahead, a bearish case for Colgate's stock does not imply ""all is not well,"" Carey said.Rather, the analyst said the company looks more exposed to headwinds versus peers that don't need to make similar decisions.Clorox's 'Comp The Comp' Story: Clorox has three tailwinds working in its favor that should allow the company to ""comp the comp"" on the top line, Carey said. They are: 1) expectations for an incremental $500 million of sales from inventory restocking, 2) a fast-growing and margin-rich professional business and 3) investments in advertising and promotions in fiscal 2021 that should support growth or at least give management flexibility to drive earnings growth.""In the long run, CLX's categories are on trend and CLX can leverage its portfolio for better shelf space and stickier placement,"" the analyst said.""We believe demand for cleaning products is likely to sustain regardless, but especially the longer COVID cases remain high.""Procter & Gamble's Best Quarter In Decades: P&G just reported what could be its ""best quarter in decades,"" and this signals that all the ""hard work is done,"" Carey said. Specifically, the company's organic sales growth of 9% was the highest seen since 2005, while sales leverage helped bring in the highest quarterly operating margin in at least 20 years, the analyst said. The Street is underestimating the company's outlook moving forward as fiscal 2022 estimates might be $4 billion too low if the recent momentum continues, he said.Also, P&G is growing faster in the U.S., and this will translate to higher margins, superior positive cash flow and EPS growth, Carey said. Finally, expectations for ""significant earnings flexibility"" means the company can return additional cash to shareholders, likely through share repurchases, according to Wells Fargo.

2020-12-20,"(Bloomberg) -- If you worry about all the waste generated by the annual rush of holiday shopping and gift giving, it’s nothing compared to the mountains of discarded packaging that comes from a single event in China.On Nov. 11 each year, the world’s biggest consumer market goes into overdrive as e-commerce giants like Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. and JD.com Inc. lure shoppers with huge bargains during the Singles’ Day bonanza. Alibaba reported almost 500 billion yuan ($76 billion) of sales this year, nearly four times U.S. Black Friday and Cyber Monday spending combined. On its Tmall platform, transactions reached a peak when 583,000 orders were made in a single second.All those purchases meant 675 million packages had to be delivered, a 26% increase from 2019. Online shopping in China generated 9.4 million tons of packaging in 2018, according to Greenpeace, which projects that the amount could rise to 41 million tons by 2025, about the same as all the waste produced by Japan in a year. Greenpeace estimates that Singles’ Day generated 52,400 metric tons of CO2 from manufacturing, packaging and shipping in 2017. The national railway has to employ hundreds of high-speed trains to help with deliveries every year.As President Xi Jinping pushes for stronger environmental protection and consumers grow more eco-conscious, the nation’s e-commerce giants are under pressure to find greener ways to handle the annual extravaganza, starting with plastic. China’s soaring use of the material has become one of the world’s most pressing environmental issues, but switching to other materials is costly for smaller businesses and the government has struggled to implement a plan to phase out single-use plastics. Zipper BoxesE-commerce companies are trying to stem the tide. For Singles’ Day this year, Alibaba’s logistics arm Cainiao designed recyclable corrugated cardboard boxes that don’t have to be sealed with plastic tape. The company offered the packaging to more than 500 sellers on Tmall, including brands like Nestle SA and Procter & Gamble Co. The so-called zipper boxes cost twice as much as their usual packaging, but sellers that opt to use them get extra promotion on the website. Cainiao says it used 190,000 plastic-free boxes and 3 million biodegradable bags to package Singles’ Day orders this year. While that’s a step forward, it’s just a fraction of the total increase in packaging this year.At one of Cainiao’s warehouses in Langfang city southeast of Beijing, the zipper boxes appeared frequently on the assembly line as employees worked in shifts around the clock to meet demand during the busiest week in November. Cainiao emblazons the boxes with dolphin images to “raise awareness of how plastic pollutes the oceans,” said Tang Linrong, a member of the company’s packaging solutions team. Tang said his team plans to promote the zipper boxes at other shopping events throughout the year. The nation is making other efforts to cut shipping waste. China’s State Post Bureau says 96% of the country’s delivery services have adopted digital waybills and switched to thinner packaging tape to reduce plastic use. Suning.com, an appliance seller, last year launched shared delivery box programs in 13 cities.  But it’s the millions of smaller retailers which are the backbone of China’s consumer goods industry that are the sticking point.Unlike Tmall, which mostly caters to established brands and international companies, Alibaba’s Taobao platform allows these vendors to sell directly to customers. Prices are so competitive that reducing packaging and shipping costs are crucial for sellers to make a profit. Angela Cai, Cainiao’s head of international communications, said Taobao will give retailers who join their green initiatives special perks to help them attract customers.Red TapeStill, without government regulation, companies are left to decide if they want to use more sustainable packaging. Online shopping has become such a key driver of China’s domestic economy, especially during the pandemic, that authorities have been reluctant to institute rules that could hurt the industry. The environment ministry, which drives climate policies, doesn’t have the power to mandate greener packaging.“There is a mismatch between which department has the power to manage, what can they manage and what needs to be managed,” said Tang Damin, Plastics Campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia. “The regulator in charge of packaging in the delivery sector can do nothing more than give suggestions to the e-commerce business.” China officially banned free plastic bags at markets in 2008 and has said that non-degradable plastic straws should be eliminated by 2020, but those declarations have largely been ignored by the public. Plastic bags are freely available at most markets. Days before the deadline for eliminating straws, drink shops in Beijing’s most upscale neighborhoods still provided them. An ambitious mandatory recycling pilot program that was rolled out in cities including Shanghai and Beijing has struggled to take off. Experts caution that the degradable plastics many Chinese companies are switching to aren’t necessarily more environmentally friendly. The majority of degradable plastic, for example, breaks down within six months only in facilities with temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius and certain humidity conditions. These plastics often end up in landfills, where they can remain intact for much longer.Switching to cardboard also has its environmental issues. Cardboard production is water intensive, generates emissions and runs the risk of encouraging deforestation if not sourced sustainably. It’s also hard to recycle if contaminated with food or other waste. Ultimately, the most effective way to curb the surge in packaging may be to encourage people to consume less. Days after this year’s Singles’ Day, staff at a recycling station on Beijing’s Beixinqiao street were still working overtime to sort through the tons of plastic, cardboard and polystyrene foam that had poured in.“The government put out slogans on garbage sorting everywhere, but I see more and more unsorted trash,” said a worker surnamed Zhao. “I guess it’s easy to talk about the environment but it’s hard to resist the temptation to buy.” For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",China’s Online Shopping Addiction Is Killing Its Green Packaging Drive

2020-12-31,"Intelligence operatives, colloquially known as spies, often reference the fear of going to the “fingernail factory.” You can imagine why. Some countries take a very dim view on their national security being violated. But if I were involved in the clandestine services, I’d fear arriving at the “dentist’s office.” There’s a fine line between service and torture in this industry. But that shouldn’t deter you from dental stocks to buy.
Prior to the novel coronavirus pandemic – and believe me, I’m going to get to that shortly – the cleaning sector, so to speak, offered a reliable upside pathway. During the old normal, industry experts predicted that the global dental market in 2020 would haul in $35 billion, while the following year would generate $36.8 billion. These were hardly unreasonable estimates given prior tallies, thus supporting the case for dental stocks to buy.
Of course, SARS-CoV-2 had a thing or two to say about this sector and so many others. Naturally, with the exploding crisis and government shutdown orders, many elective medical procedures were put on hold. Further, with dentists and their assistants at great risk due to Covid-19 being a respiratory disease, the pandemic had a detrimental impact on this market segment.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Nevertheless, it’s important to realize that dental stocks to buy cover a wide range of products and services. For instance, the size of the global oral care market was projected to be nearly $46 billion before the crisis, potentially reaching $53.3 billion by 2025. Frankly, I don’t imagine that these numbers will change all that much. If anything, they might increase.
How so? With the lockdowns impacting dentists’ offices throughout the world, most people likely realized how important self-sufficiency is regarding their health. Therefore, Covid-19 played a sector evangelism role for the industry, which bolsters these dental stocks.

Because of the highly variable nature of this industry due to the coronavirus, many of these names are not what you call direct plays. That’s on purpose as the dental industry still has some distinct headwinds to overcome. By spreading out the risk across both direct and indirect investments, you’ll likely have a better outcome with these dental stocks to buy.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL)

One of the biggest names among dental stocks to buy is Colgate-Palmolive Company. This descriptor was appropriate well before the pandemic. With the crisis raging to unbelievable levels in many parts of the world, CL stock offers an elementally direct pathway to profitability. Obviously, with another round of shutdowns in place in key economies, there’s never been a more important time for self-care.
Not only that, the fundamentals match the technicals, which is exactly what you want to see with stable investments. On a year-to-date basis, CL stock is up 23%, which is tremendous when you think about it. No, going to the dentist’s office doesn’t rank highly for either patients or dental professionals, especially today. But such an awful dynamic highlights the importance of stocking up on toothpaste and related hygienic accessories.
As if you needed another reason to consider including CL in your list of dental stocks to buy, a Colgate laboratory test demonstrated “that toothpastes containing zinc or stannous and mouthwash formulas with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) neutralize the virus that causes COVID-19 by 99.9 percent.” That’s good enough for me.

Procter & Gamble (PG)

Among the powerful household goods brands in the global markets, Procter & Gamble is also a worthwhile idea out of the dental stocks to buy. Primarily, this is due to its oral care brands, which include Crest, Oral-B, Scope and Fixodent. As with CL above, PG stock has been a cynical beneficiary of the shutdowns, with consumers laser-focused on personal hygiene products.
Though Procter & Gamble doesn’t quite measure up to Colgate-Palmolive in the technical department (PG stock is up nearly 11% YTD), I do appreciate the former company’s broad household exposure. For instance, when the coronavirus first breached our borders, everybody began rushing for essential goods. Obviously, oral hygiene ranked highly during this panic.

But it’s not just about that. Many folks stocked up on toilet paper despite Covid-19 being a respiratory disease, not an excretory one. Whatever, Procter & Gamble still benefited, thanks to its Charmin brand of TP. As well, the company was the go-to choice for laundry products, baby care and other personal needs which we don’t need to discuss because you have an imagination.

Henry Schein (HSIC)
Source: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.com
	
At the time I’m writing this, Henry Schein shares are barely above parity. We’re talking just under 1% for the year so far, which is not great. Also, holding HSIC stock is a matter of speculating on capital gains as the company doesn’t pay a dividend. That’s not necessarily high on growth investors’ priorities but it does stink when you’re returning less than 1%.
Of course, that’s better than losing money so we should count our blessings. Nevertheless, HSIC stock could bounce back on a societal and economic recovery. It’s probably not one of the dental stocks to buy right now but it’s definitely worth putting on your radar.
As a distributor of dental and medical products, Henry Schein obviously needs some normalization. Fortunately for the beleaguered organization, the Covid-19 vaccine research, development and distribution have truly happened at warp speed. Theoretically, once we achieve herd immunity, the concept of pent-up demand can lift shares higher.
Don’t believe me? As a guest expert on CGTN America, I discussed that people are buying Christmas-related products out of desperation for normalcy. Once it’s safe, these same folks will likely purchase services that are truly meaningful.

3M (MMM)
Source: JPstock / Shutterstock.com
	
Unlike Henry Schein above, industrial giant 3M is in red ink for the year, at least as of this writing. However, the company pays a dividend, which must be accounted for if you’re going to make holistic return comparisons. The other difference with 3M is that this is one of the companies that’s on the margins of what you might consider dental stocks to buy. So, why bother mentioning MMM stock?
If you’re thinking N95 masks, you’re spot on. And it also means I’m becoming terribly predictable, something that should be my new year’s resolution to change. But taking that aside, I believe this will be a critical factor moving forward.
According to DentistryIQ.com, the pricing for N95s lacked transparency. Then, with the Covid-19 crisis, an explosion in pricing – I’m not going to call it price gouging because otherwise, I’d get trolled by those defending billionaire executives’ honor – caused chaos within the sector.

But if there’s a positive here, it’s that we all learned that production of critical products should never be outsourced. This sentiment shift should benefit MMM stock, which has been slowly rising since this year’s March doldrums.

Dentsply Sirona (XRAY)
Source: Cineberg / Shutterstock.com
	
For the vast majority of patients, Dentsply Sirona is a brand of comfort. As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of dental equipment and supplies, the company does its best to make sure that what is sometimes an unpleasant experience is as tolerable as possible.
That is unless you’re an intelligence operative captured by unfriendly forces. Then, Dentsply Sirona may be a distinctly unpleasant brand. But that’s a different topic for a different day.
Unfortunately, XRAY stock also found itself in the dentist’s office, if you get my drift. If you don’t, then check out the equity unit’s YTD performance, which is almost 9% in the red. Since around election day, shares were moving higher. But then coronavirus cases started worsening, and not even the promise of mass vaccinations could help direct dental stocks to buy.
Does this mean you should avoid XRAY stock? For the time being, I’d probably end up waiting on the sidelines. With how much this pandemic has spiraled out of control, I’m not sure when people will feel comfortable going back to see their dentists. However, keep it on your watch list because a return to normal could strongly benefit from pent-up demand.

CVS Health (CVS)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
	
CVS Health isn’t what you call a direct play on dental stocks to buy. But that doesn’t make it any less relevant to oral hygiene. Indeed, if you find yourself needing whatever common health and wellness product, your local CVS store (many of which are open 24/7) will likely be able to help.
This latter point – accessibility/availability – is a lot more crucial for the narrative of CVS stock than some folks might realize. If you think back to the initial wave of shelter-in-place orders, one of the biggest disruptions to our daily lives was loss of convenient access. Suddenly, retailers that were open all hours or well into the night introduced Covid hours. And that put frontline workers who were working non-traditional schedules into a bind.
Naturally, the importance of this convenience thesis faded until recently. With daily Covid-19 cases surging, resulting in a worrying spike in hospitalizations, many jurisdictions have re-imposed strict lockdown measures. Cynically, this helps CVS stock as it’s an essential investment.

Moreover, I like that CVS isn’t just related to oral hygiene but to a wide range of common needs. Should this crisis worsen in the near term (which is probable), you’ll want to keep tabs on CVS.

Throughout this year, Johnson & Johnson has been in the news not as an opportunity among dental stocks to buy but as a Covid-19 vaccine provider. While leaders Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) have dominated headlines, JNJ stock is still relevant in the space because its underlying vaccine is a single-dose approach which doesn’t require frozen storage.
As you know, frozen storage is a bit of a problem regarding the practicality of mass vaccinations. But anyways, that’s a different theme. Here, we’re discussing dental stocks to buy and Johnson & Johnson provides investors with a stable brand that can ride out multiple storms.
First, if we do have that return to normal (or somewhat normal), JNJ stock is primed to benefit. The underlying healthcare giant has a dental professional arm, which sells products like toothbrushes and floss in bulk.
Second, if our trajectory doesn’t lead us to normalcy in an ideal timeframe, then the company offers a full spectrum of oral hygiene products. As we’ve seen with toilet paper runs, common household goods have become top commodities and they could be that way again.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)

Like Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline entered the Covid-19 vaccine sweepstakes. Unlike its rival, GSK stock probably isn’t the most viable play on the pandemic. To be fair, one factor that I appreciate is that the company utilizes a more proven subunit approach. However, Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) has the clear lead in that department. Still, anything can happen, I suppose.
But the lack of credibility in the coronavirus space may have helped contribute to volatility in GSK stock. Certainly, this is one of the ugliest dental stocks to buy from a YTD perspective. However, shares could enjoy surprising upside due to the underlying company’s Sensodyne brand of toothpaste for people with sensitive teeth.
According to a survey of U.S. dental offices, one-in-eight people have sensitive teeth. Sadly, with the pandemic getting out of control, it’s just not feasible for people to head on over to their local dentist. Sufferers must deal with their pain on their own for a while, which cynically lifts GlaxoSmithKline’s investment profile through increased sales of Sensodyne toothpaste.

2021-01-19,"Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) announces its next round of earnings this Wednesday, January 20. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Wednesday's Q2 earnings announcement.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Analysts covering Procter & Gamble modeled for quarterly EPS of $1.51 on revenue of $19.28 billion. Procter & Gamble EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $1.42. Sales were $18.24 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin.View more earnings on PGThe analyst consensus estimate would represent a 6.34% increase in the company's earnings. Revenue would be up 5.7% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the Procter & Gamble's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past:Quarter Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020  EPS Estimate 1.41 1.01 1.13 1.37  EPS Actual 1.63 1.16 1.17 1.42  Revenue Estimate 18.35 B 16.97 B 17.46 B 18.35 B  Revenue Actual 19.32 B 17.70 B 17.21 B 18.24 B  Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 7.8%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders can relax going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement.Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call.

Over the past month, the stock fell by 3.45%, but over the past year, it actually increased by 5.32%.

The stock is currently under from its 52 week high by 10.40%.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued.

2021-01-20,"Over the past three months, shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) moved lower by 4.46%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Procter & Gamble has.Procter & Gamble's Debt Based on Procter & Gamble's financial statement as of October 20, 2020, long-term debt is at $23.95 billion and current debt is at $7.71 billion, amounting to $31.66 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $13.39 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $18.26 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Procter & Gamble's $119.90 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.26. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-01-21,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported FY 2Q21 adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share that came in ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1.51 per share as consumers piled up on cleaning and cosmetics products during the coronavirus pandemic. The consumer goods giant generated second-quarter revenue of $19.7 billion, reflecting growth of 8% year-on-year. Analysts had been looking for $19.3 billion. Shares closed at $131.93 on Jan. 20. The company earned $1.47 per share on a diluted basis, up by 4% year-on-year. For FY21, P&G (PG) expects diluted earning per share (EPS) to grow in the range of 8% to 10% from FY20 EPS of $4.96. “We delivered another strong quarter of results across all key measures – top line, bottom line and cash. We remain focused on executing our strategies of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and improving P&G’s organization and culture,” commented P&G CEO David Taylor. “These strategies enabled us to build strong business momentum before the COVID crisis, accelerated our progress in calendar year 2020 and remain the right strategies to deliver balanced growth and value creation over the long term.” Additionally, P&G raised its FY21 sales outlook. The company now projects revenue to grow in the range of 5% to 6%, up from an earlier range of between 3% to 4%. The lifted FY21 outlook includes headwinds from currency fluctuations, higher freight costs, and higher interest expense. Furthermore, P&G intends to pay around $8 billion in dividends in FY21 and expects to buy back shares of up to $10 billion during the same period. (See PG stock analysis on TipRanks) Ahead of the earnings results, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy on Jan. 19 reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but reduced the price target from $169 to $168. “We expect PG to lift its FY21 guide w/strong demand, USD weakness, and productivity, partially offset by commodities. PG (and staples) continue to lag S&P 500 leaving shares at ~22.5x NTM P/E, which is relative low vs. mkt since ’08-09 downturn,” Grundy wrote in a note to investors. Overall, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the stock and the consensus is a Moderate Buy with 4 analysts suggesting a Buy and 3 analysts recommending a Hold. The average price target of $155.43 implies 19% upside potential to current levels. As per the TipRanks Smart Score system, Procter & Gamble scores a 9 out of 10, which indicates a high likelihood of outperformance.

2021-02-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the biggest names on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley—JPMorgan Chase, Advent International, Khosla Ventures among them—are pumping billions of dollars into mom-and-pops selling everything from tea kettles to jock itch remedies on Amazon.com Inc.Investment banks, venture firms and private equity shops are backing so-called Amazon aggregators—often led by e-commerce veterans—that are betting they can take up-and-coming sellers, who often operate out of their garages, and transform them into global brands. The aggregators say they have the expertise to select strong products and avoid faddish ones that flame out before they have a chance to grow. The latest entrant, Branded Group, said Tuesday it had purchased 20 houseware and leisure brands. Formed last summer and flush with $150 million raised by the Berlin venture firm Target Global, Branded will be run by Pierre Poignant, who previously led the southeast Asian online marketplace Lazada, and Michael Ronen, who spent almost 20 years in mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs and was a founding partner of SoftBank’s Vision Fund.“We want to be a multi-billion dollar company,” says Poignant, who oversaw the sale of Lazada to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Poignant acknowledges that “buying businesses is one thing. Scaling them is another.”About 40 Amazon aggregators have emerged in the past few years, according to people following the trend, with most of them still quietly seeking deals behind the scenes. Eight have announced fundraising rounds totaling more than $2.5 billion since 2019.Thrasio, launched in 2018, has the deepest pockets and has already purchased 90 companies with $1.75 billion in funding and debt from backers that include the private-equity firm Advent International. Perch, founded in 2020, has raised $130 million and gobbled up almost 30 brands. Several private equity firms have launched websites to court Amazon sellers without disclosing how much they’ve designated to buy them.The demand for Amazon mom-and-pops reflects the maturation of the e-commerce giant’s third-party marketplace, which accounts for more than half of all products sold on the site. The web store has grown so large that deep-pocketed investors can prospect for tomorrow's big hit among the millions of merchants competing on the site. “The emergence of these companies reflects how selling with Amazon offers small businesses powerful opportunities to build their brands and reach millions of customers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email. Thrasio, based in Walpole, Massachusetts, was early to the game but has attracted well-financed competition since the pandemic pushed millions of consumers online, possibly changing shopping habits forever. The news that Thrasio had surpassed a $1 billion valuation in June pulled in even more investors. Aggregators look for consistent money-makers with annual sales up to about $10 million; they generally offer three to four times a target’s annual profit, including the salary the owners pay themselves. The buyers don’t focus on specific categories the way a Procter & Gamble Co. does but are content to jam together a potpourri of brands. Perch, for example, sells maternity belts, auto upholstery tools, peppermint-based athlete’s foot cures and virtual-reality headsets.The synergies happen on the back-end, where experts in global logistics, search engine optimization and Amazon advertising can apply their knowhow to any profitable product with good reviews. Beyond expertise, the aggregators have the funds mom-and-pop businesses often lack to expand internationally. The aggregators also consolidate their purchasing power with manufacturers and shipping companies to negotiate lower prices.“Amazon sellers are salivating right now because all of these investors are lining up around the block to buy them,” says James Thomson, a former Amazon executive who now advises online merchants. “Many many more aggregators will emerge before this starts to slow down.”The gold rush is happening despite perceptions that Amazon is a hostile environment where merchants can be kicked off after a few bad reviews or bogus counterfeiting charges and sometimes spend months trying to get reinstated. Over the years, some sellers have built decent businesses only to watch Amazon start selling its own versions of their products.The aggregators say those risks are real but worth taking given the potential rewards of being on a site that captures almost 40 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S., a figure they expect to keep growing even as stores reopen and people get vaccinated for Covid-19. Their north star is Anker Innovations Technology Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that started selling cell phone chargers on Amazon and grew into a global electronics brand worth more than $10 billion whose products have graduated from Amazon’s web store to the shelves at Walmart Inc. and Target Corp.“Amazon is building a massive economy comparable to the gross domestic product of entire countries,” says Branded’s Ronen. “I mostly see an opportunity to partner with them. Our interests are aligned.”For Amazon merchants who can’t afford to expand or are simply burned out, the swarm of aggregators offer a viable exit strategy. Tony and Carol Meibock, a husband and wife team from Calgary, Canada, carved out a niche selling soaps and foot soaks made from peppermint and tea tree oil to treat dry skin, jock itch and athlete’s foot. With annual sales in the millions of dollars and their company, Truremedy Naturals, turning a profit, Tony quit his software job to help run the business.Then demand surged during the pandemic, and the couple found themselves working nonstop to resolve one supply-chain headache after another. To keep growing required hiring more people, which would have hurt profits and made the company worth less to a buyer. Tony Meibock, 54, had already made connections with potential acquirers in the tight-knit community of online merchants, so it wasn’t hard to spread word that he was interested in selling. His phone and his email inbox blew up.Not that it was easy letting go of a business they’d built. “My wife was attached to it. It was her baby. But we also realized we needed a break,” he says. “Of course we wanted to make some money, but we cared about the brand and wanted to leave it in good hands.”He spoke with about five interested parties last summer and sold to Perch in January for undisclosed terms. Carol is enjoying time with the grandkids; Tony will try advising other firms that sell on Amazon. Ski trips are on the agenda.Perch was founded by Chris Bell, a Boston entrepreneur who learned how to value businesses while working in mergers and acquisitions at Bain & Co. Later, he got e-commerce experience running Wayfair Inc.’s delivery operations. Bell attended a New York conference for Amazon sellers in 2019 and was surprised to encounter big crowds at a session on how to sell your business. The attendees had the same manufacturing and shipping problems he had learned to solve, and Bell got interested in rolling up sellers.He half hoped friends would talk him out of it. Instead, a pal pulled up the Amazon website, searched for faucets and marveled that obscure brands dominated the results. Kohler Co., a mainstay at home-improvement chains, was nowhere to be found. “All of these big brands with all of these advertising dollars don’t dominate Amazon,” Bell says. “It's just a different playing field. The winners are these small guys who don’t have enough capital to expand into Europe.”He went out on his own and connected with Alex Finkelstein at Spark Capital. An early Wayfair investor who watched the furniture and housewares store prosper despite Amazon, Finkelstein knew there was room for many companies to do well online. “I view Amazon as a partner and not a competitor,” he says.Once an aggregator buys a business, typical first steps include finding more inventory to expand into Europe and Australia. Bigger factory orders help them negotiate better prices with manufacturers, materials suppliers and shippers. Sometimes small changes go a long way. Perch squeezed silicon straws into smaller packages and shaved 5% off Amazon’s shipping fees. And sometimes it’s a matter of deploying data scientists to determine how much to spend on advertising and search terms to maximize sales and profits.It’s not always smooth. Amazon suspended a maternity belt brand from the site three weeks after Perch purchased it. For reasons that remain unclear, Amazon suspected the products were counterfeit and halted all sales for two months, costing the aggregator about $500,000 in sales. “No one got much sleep,” Bell says. Finally, Amazon turned the spigot back on. Aggregators can take such body blows since their sales are spread over more brands, he says. “Now we know where the landmines are.”Thrasio is already a relatively big business. The aggregator has rolled up more than 90 companies that sell more than 15,000 products, mostly on Amazon. The company says it generated more than $100 million in profit on $500 million in sales last year. Co-founder Josh Silberstein says small Amazon businesses tend to see their margins decline as sales grow from $1 million to $10 million because they suddenly need expensive outside help to resolve logistical issues, legal matters and customer service. “As they get bigger, they get less good at covering all of these different functions,” Silberstein says. Thrasio is set up to handle such challenges for multiple products. It also created a streamlined system to quickly determine the value of an Amazon business so Thrasio can close an acquisition in as little as 35 days, a sweetener for moms and pops looking to get out.As more aggregators pour into the market, bidding wars are breaking out, and prices have spiked more than 30% in the past year, according to people involved in deals. So far, acquirers are willing to pay for proven Amazon brands, says Mark Daoust, whose Quiet Light Brokerage closed 70 transactions totaling $110 million in 2020, up 40% from the previous year and expects to close more than 100 deals this year.Idan Barzilay, 39, a Tel Aviv mechanical engineer who started selling virtual-reality smartphone headsets on Amazon a few years ago, was all set to offload his company last year. Then the buyer backed out when the pandemic hit. No matter. Sales of Barzilay’s headsets took off because homebound parents were desperate to distract their kids—even if it meant more screen time. Soon his company was more valuable than ever, and he sold to Perch for confidential terms.“The sellers, we are like fish in a lake,” Barzilay says. “There are a lot of fishermen, which means it gets harder and harder for them to catch a nice fish.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Wall Street Is Investing Billions to Scale Tiny Mom-and-Pop Sellers on Amazon

2021-04-02,"Blue-chip stocks are typically cornerstones of most long-term portfolios. They’re large capitalization businesses with relatively long histories, a broad range of resources, strong brands, stable earnings and cash-flow growth. These businesses benefit from economies of scale and can quickly invest in new technologies. The 30 stocks included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are blue-chip stocks. So, today I’m introducing you to seven DJIA blue-chip names that could work for buy-and-hold investors. The companies in the DJIA represent a wide range of industries. Following the market lows seen in spring 2020, they have also rebounded significantly. In fact, the broad-based market rally since November has taken the index to new highs in recent days. Year-to-date (YTD), the index is up over 8%. Similarly, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:DIA) — an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the returns of the DJIA — has also returned over 8%. April means the start of a new earnings season, which typically brings increased volatility to broader markets. Are you worried that further choppiness may put pressure on many stocks that have gone up double digits in the past 52 weeks? Then it may be time to look for solid blue-chip stocks that could brave possible further headwinds in second quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Cheap Stocks with Growing Tailwinds With that background in mind, here are seven of the best blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones. I believe these names have strong business models, clean balance sheets, proactive management and strong competitive positions. They should create shareholder value for many quarters to come: American Express (NYSE:AXP) Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Merck (NYSE:MRK) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: American Express (AXP) Source: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $72.61 – $151.46One-year change: Up about 86%Dividend yield: 1.19% First up on this list of blue-chip stocks, American Express offers charge and credit payment card products as well as travel-related services across the globe. With significant exposure to the travel and leisure sectors, though, sales have been negatively affected over the past year. The company released Q4 and full-year metrics back in late January. Revenue for the quarter was $9.35 billion, down 18% year-over-year (YOY). That also showed little improvement from Q3. Net income also came to $1.43 billion, meaning a decline of 15%. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $1.76, a decrease of 13%. However, EPS is expected to be between $5 and $7 in 2021. That would mean a partial recovery from the Covid-19-related decline seen in 2020. CEO Stephen Squeri noted: “While we remain cautious about the pace of recovery, we are focused on achieving our aspiration of being back to the original EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022, and for the company to be positioned to execute on its financial growth algorithm.” Currently, AXP stock’s forward price-earnings (P/E) and price-sales (P/S) ratios are 22.4 and 2.93, respectively. With expected increases in travel spending in the coming months, the company’s revenues will possibly improve during the year. However, given the upcoming earnings release in late April, shares could be volatile. A potential decline toward the $135-level would offer better value. Intel (INTC) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $43.61 – $67.44One-year change: Up about 24%Dividend yield: 2.15% Intel is one of the largest chipmakers in the world. Its products range from personal computing to data-center applications and it delivers computer, networking, data storage and communications platforms. In fact, Intel is one of the most important providers of central processing units (CPUs) for laptops, desktops and servers. What’s more, recently Intel has been in focus, thanks to an increase in the share price following the announcement that Pat Gelsinger would be the new CEO. Over the past several years, the performance of INTC stock has lagged behind the semiconductor sector. Now, though, the company is taking steps to enter the foundry business. The Street seems to approve of these plans. In late January, Intel announced Q4 and full-year metrics. Quarterly revenue was $20 billion, down just 1% YOY. Non-GAAP net income was $6.2 billion, down 6% YOY. Furthermore, EPS was flat at $1.52 on a non-GAAP basis. In 2020, the group also generated a record $35.4 billion cash from operations and $21.1 billion of free cash flow during the quarter. Bob Swan, Intel’s CEO at the time, noted: “We significantly exceeded our expectations for the quarter, capping off our fifth consecutive record year […] Demand for the computing performance Intel delivers remains very strong and our focus on growth opportunities is paying off […] Intel is in a strong strategic and financial position as we make this leadership transition and take Intel to the next level.” The 8 Biggest Growth Stocks of the First Quarter This pick of the blue-chip stocks has forward P/E and P/S ratios of 14.01 and 3.60, respectively. I believe the chipmaker deserves to be on your radar screen. However, a potential decline closer to $60 would improve the margin of safety. Merck (MRK) Source: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $71.72 – $87.80One-year change: Up about 4.5%Dividend yield: 3.37% Next up on this list of blue-chip stocks, pharma giant Merck develops leading treatments against cancer and infectious diseases. The company’s research and products also extend to animal health. Keytruda, an antibody used in cancer immunotherapy, is one of the leading sources of revenue for the company. In early February, Merck released Q4 and full-year results. Worldwide sales during the quarter were $12.5 billion, up 5% YOY. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.32 for the quarter. Further, worldwide revenue for the fiscal year rose 2% YOY to $48 billion, while full-year non-GAAP EPS was $5.94. Management expects full-year 2021 sales between $51.8 billion and $53.8 billion as well as non-GAAP EPS between $6.48 and $6.68. On the results, CEO Kenneth Frazier commented: “Our scientists continue to advance our internal pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines, including in oncology, HIV, and pneumococcal disease, and, more recently, therapeutics for COVID-19. These pipeline developments provide us with increasing line-of-sight to significant potential growth drivers later this decade and into the next.” Merck’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 11.84 and 3.74, respectively. This name is well-known as a reliable dividend company that also buys back shares. So, any decline in MRK stock during the upcoming earnings season would make it a strong candidate for dividend growth and passive income portfolios. Microsoft (MSFT) Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $152.19 – $246.13One-year change: Up about 59%Dividend yield: 0.92% Tech darling Microsoft needs little introduction on this list of blue-chip stocks. The firm is best known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. Recent years have seen operations also extend to its cloud-based Microsoft Azure, which now competes with Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS). Generally over the past year, MSFT shares have benefited greatly from the digitalization trend. Microsoft announced Q2 2021 results at the end of January. Revenue was up by 17% YOY and came at $43.1 billion. The biggest revenue driver was the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment, with a 23% YOY increase. Additionally, net income increased 33% and reached $15.5 billion. Diluted EPS also jumped by 34% to $2.03. Finally, total cash and equivalents at the end of period stood at $132 billion. Amy Hood, CFO of Microsoft, commented on the earnings call: “[F]or FY21, with our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our outlook for Q3, we expect to deliver another full year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth, as well as healthy operating margin expansion even after excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and COVID-related savings.” Management expects as much as $13.6 billion in revenue from the Productivity and Business processes segment in Q3. For the Intelligent Cloud segment, top line is estimated to be between $14.7 billion and $14.95 billion. Finally, the Personal Computing segment is anticipated to see $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion in revenue. 7 Oil Stocks Being Squeezed by Weak Demand Right now, shares of MSFT stock are trading at a forward P/E of 32.88 and P/S of 11.16. Moving forward, analysts expect the company to become a leading name in artificial intelligence (AI) as well the Internet of Things (IoT). However, a potential decline toward $225 would improve the risk-return profile here. Procter & Gamble (PG) Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $111.25 – $146.92One-year change: Up about 23%Dividend yield: 2.36% Procter & Gamble is one of the most important consumer goods manufacturers worldwide. Billions of global citizens use its brands, including Ariel, Crest, Dawn, Gillette, Pampers, Tide and more. Altogether, the company has a strong market share both stateside and globally. Plus, the pandemic has meant increased sales for many of its household products. Over the past several years, PG’s management has focused on making the company a leaner organization, narrowing its offering to approximately 70 to 80 brands. As a result, organic growth has been stable. These restructuring efforts have also led to significant cost-cutting. Like other blue-chip stocks on this list, this company announced fiscal year 2021 Q2 results in late January. Net sales of $19.7 billion meant an increase of 8% YOY. Net earnings were $3.8 billion, up 4% YOY. Diluted net EPS was $1.47, also up 4%. Finally, free cash flow as of Dec. 31, 2020 was roughly $4.9 billion. Altogether, PG came out of 2020 with strong financials. President and CEO David Taylor noted: “We remain focused on executing our strategies of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and improving P&G’s organization and culture. These strategies enabled us to build strong business momentum before the COVID crisis, accelerated our progress in calendar year 2020 and remain the right strategies to deliver balanced growth and value creation over the long term.” However, PG stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios of 23.60 and 4.38 point to an overstretched valuation level. So, interested investors might want to wait for the next quarterly results and a potential pullback toward $125. With a wide moat and dividend-aristocrat status, though, PG stock should appeal to a range of passive income seekers. Salesforce (CRM) Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $131.66 – $284.50One-year change: Up about 63%Dividend yield: N/A Our next pick of the blue-chip stocks, Salesforce was added to the DJIA back in August 2020. This group provides customer relationship management (CRM) enterprise products. Its well-known platform includes marketing and sales automation, customer service, digital commerce, analytics and collaborative productivity tools. What’s more, the company has been increasingly focused on cloud-based offerings. Salesforce announced Q4 and full-year results back in February. Quarterly revenue was $5.82 billion, up 20% YOY. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.04. Cash from operations for the quarter was also up 33%, at $2.17 billion. Total cash and equivalents came at $11.97 billion. Furthermore, management raised its first-quarter fiscal 2022 revenue guidance to between roughly $5.88 billion and $5.89 billion, which would be growth of about 21%. On the results, CEO Marc Benioff noted: “We had a record quarter and year by innovating more and faster than ever, enabling our customers to be successful from anywhere, and becoming more relevant and strategic than ever.” 8 Small-Cap Stocks With Plenty of Cred CRM stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 63.58 and 7.82, respectively, pointing to an overextended valuation. Investors have recently started to rotate away from technology stocks. Therefore, a potential decline below $200 is possible in the coming weeks. Personally, CRM is on my strong wish list in Q2. As one of the largest software-as-a-service (SAAS) businesses, it has a bright future for the next decade. Verizon (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $52.85- $61.95One-year change: Up about 10%Dividend yield: 4.31% Our last entry on this list of blue-chip stocks, Verizon is an important telecommunications group for the ongoing digitalization trend in the United States. It provides provides products and services in tech, communications, information and entertainment. It is also becoming a significant player in 5G. With its voice, data and video services, the company generated revenues of $128.3 billion in 2020. Verizon announced Q4 and full-year results in late January. Quarterly revenue was $34.7 billion, down fractionally YOY. Net income was $4.7 billion, which was down 9.6%. Adjusted EPS was $1.21, too. Finally, the company ended 2020 with free cash flow of $23.6 billion, an increase of about 32% YOY. CEO Hans Vestberg commented: “[Verizon] witnessed a mass shift toward virtual collaboration, touchless retail and delivery, remote work, distance learning, and telemedicine […] We continued to execute our multi-use network strategy; we were recognized by RootMetrics as the best overall wireless provider, undefeated in all categories; and we continue to be the partner of choice for the world’s most innovative brands. Today, we are excited to lead technological advances beyond mobile devices, and create new opportunities for growth across multiple industries.” VZ stock currently has forward P/E and P/S ratios of 11.49 and 1.81, respectively. All in all, 2020 became the year when consumers needed faster networks. Verizon succeeded in offering that. As a result, it has a dependable stream of revenue and cash — both crucial qualities in a dividend player.

2021-04-09,"No matter what stage an investor is at in their stock market journey, dividend stocks inevitably become a focus. For some, it’s a focus that lasts a lifetime. For others, their interest is fleeting. In any regard, these holdings play a large role when it comes to how the individual investor deploys their capital. As you’ll see in some of the examples below, many of these stocks have been big-time winners over the decades. However, those returns inflate even more once the dividend is taken into consideration. In many cases, a company’s dividend can be fleeting. Many end up needed to cut the dividend because the business environment became too difficult, because a recession occurred or cash flows tightened. In many cases, these companies may not eliminate the dividend. Instead, they may simply reduce the payout or take a couple years off from giving it a raise.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 However, nothing is better than owning a stake in a consistent business with great leadership, that gives us a raise each year. Let’s look at seven dividend stocks with more than 50 years of rising dividends: Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) Federal Realty Trust (NYSE:FRT) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) Dividend Stocks: Procter & Gamble (PG) Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 64 Let’s begin this list with the company that has the longest streak of the stocks we chose: P&G. The company has made its dividend raise a habit at this point, with more than six decades of consecutive increases. Investors can count on the sun rising in the east, setting in the west and Procter & Gamble raising its dividend each year. Over the years, Procter & Gamble has cemented itself as a staple in the consumer packaged goods business. The company has found a way into nearly every corner of the consumer’s home. Whether that’s paper towels or toilet paper, baby wipes or diapers, tampons, toothpaste, razor blades, shampoo, laundry detergent, dish soap — you name it. These products are essential. It doesn’t matter if we’re in a booming economy or a deep recession. Either way, consumers are still going to use deodorant and brush their teeth. Thus, P&G has raised its dividend for decades on end. Look for that to continue. 3M Co (MMM) Source: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 63 3M Company doesn’t lag far beyond Procter & Gamble in the dividend department. Kicking out a 3.1% dividend yield and this one is on income investors’ radar. This stock has not had the best performance, though. While shares are up nicely from the March 2020 low, they remain about 26% off the all-time high, set in January 2018. The stock was locked in a multi-year downtrend before the novel coronavirus swept around the world. 3M has not been firing on all cylinders, although the industrial and consumer goods company has really turned things around lately. Analysts expect decent growth, too. Revenue forecasts call for growth of 6.7% and 4% this year and next year, respectively. That’s alongside roughly 10% and 9% earnings growth estimates in those years, respectively. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 Shares trade at a reasonable 20 times earnings. That’s not a bad valuation for this type of growth and the dependability that comes with 3M’s dividend. Further, the stock is taking out last year’s high and looks to have some decent momentum on the technical side. Federal Realty Trust (FRT) Source: Shutterstock Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 53 Federal Realty is one of the most interesting names on this list, in my humble opinion. Over the years, Federal Realty has become one of the most coveted blue-chip REITs in the business. With more than five decades of consecutive dividend increases, there’s not many companies in the industry that can challenge FRT. When we run into dividend stocks with this many years of consecutive increases, it can be hard to find a meaty payout. Despite the rebound we’ve seen in the stock price – Federal Realty is up 62% from the 2020 lows – it still has a solid yield of 4.1%. This diversified real estate player has a proven history of strong operations and dependable income. To put this stock’s yield in a bit more perspective, FRT hasn’t had a yield north of 3.6% in the past 10 years. That is, until 2020. Given the beating that the REIT space took last year, it looks like a solid opportunity for long-term investors. Dividend Stocks: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Source: Niloo / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 58 This company truly has a lot going for it. Not only is J&J a dependable dividend stalwart with almost six decades of consecutive pay increases, it’s a staple in the healthcare sector, too. With multiple business units within this space, J&J has its patients covered. Whether that’s medical equipment in the hospital or at-home care via Tylenol and Band-Aids, the company’s products are dependable. The company has a foothold in the pharma space, medical devices and consumer products – all with relatively wide-ranging reach. It’s one reason this stock commands a $432 billion market capitalization. However, its latest accomplishment may be one of the most commendable. J&J has developed a vaccine for Covid-19. It’s now one of three companies vaccinating against the vaccine here in the U.S., joining Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). While the U.S. has tremendous vaccination momentum, the rest of the world isn’t quite there yet. That should pave a nice runway for companies like Johnson & Johnson as its ramps up production. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 With that in motion, investors can turn their attention to the company’s next dividend hike – likely due up in April. Lowe’s (LOW) Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 58 The momentum in the housing market is breathtaking. Low interest rates, supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19, an exodus out of larger cities and rent moratorium have allowed the housing market to boom. That’s been a major catalyst for home improvement retailers like Lowe’s. As with J&J, the company is just a few years shy of six consecutive decades of dividend increases. So not only can we count on Lowe’s for solid execution, but we can also expect a bump to the dividend each year. While revenue growth is stagnating, the earnings growth is there. Analysts expect the bottom line to increase almost 10% this year, followed by an acceleration up to 13.7% growth in 2022. Unlike many dividend stocks, this name has been enjoying a huge rally over the past year. Shares are fresh off new all-time highs and have surged from the 2020 lows, up about 225%. Obviously no one expects Lowe’s to repeat that performance in the next 12 months. But it’s shown that there is serious demand for this dividend stalwart, although it now yields just 1.25% after the stock’s run. I guess that’s the price you pay after a stock has tripled in less than a year. Coca-Cola (KO) Source: Soloviov Vadym / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 59 It shouldn’t be too surprising to see Coca-Cola make the list here. The company is a long-held stalwart when it comes to investing. Its slow and steady nature has won the appraise of millions – including Warren Buffett. While it may not be a high-flying tech stock, Coca-Cola’s consistency over the years has won over many investors. On the verge of 60 consecutive dividend raises will help in that regard. In fact, because of Coca-Cola stock, the small town of Quincy, Florida, became filled with millionaires. They were busy gobbling up shares of stock during the depression, at the urging of one of the town’s trusted bankers. 7 Great Stocks to Buy Under $10 This year is setting up as a good one for the company, too. Analysts expect 11.2% revenue growth and almost 10% earnings growth. If Coca-Cola has proven anything – whether it’s a depression in the 1920s or a pandemic in 2020 – it can survive just about anything thrown its way. Dividend Stocks: Illinois Tool Works (ITW) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Consecutive Annual Dividend Raises: 57 Last, but certainly not least, on our list of dividend stocks is Illinois Tool Works. I absolutely love this stock, because it emphasizes just how well investors can do if they’re patient and stick with quality over the long haul. Shares are up more than 3,200% in the last 30 years and 30,000% in the last 50 years. Granted, those are incredibly long hold times compared to the average investor. However, it emphasizes just how much wealth a great company can produce over several decades. Not to turn this into a stat-fest, but I think it’s an important reminder of what dividends can do. If we shift our focus from the stock-price return – such as the returns I mentioned above – to total return, meaning it includes the dividends, then those 30-year and 50-year returns explode to 5,600% and 56,400%, respectively. Despite all that strength, the company is still going strong. Consensus estimates call for 19.5% earnings growth this year and 9.5% growth next year. Here’s to the next 50 years of stellar returns.

2021-04-28,"(Bloomberg) -- The market’s reflationistas are getting a second wind, as a string of solid economic numbers and the prospect of more stimulus raise the chances of a revival in trades linked to rebounding growth and prices.A gauge of U.S. inflation expectations climbed to an eight-year high Tuesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Spot Index reached its highest since 2012 and Treasury yields saw gains across the curve.Reflation believers have warmed to reports showing soaring home prices and consumer confidence. They are also looking ahead to President Joe Biden’s pitch for a large social-spending package to Congress Wednesday and a renewed commitment from the Federal Reserve to allow inflation to run hot.“The inflation question will continually return to investors’ minds this year,” said Andy Wong, senior investment manager of the international multi-asset team at Pictet Asset Management in Hong Kong. “The U.S. household balance sheet is the healthiest it has been for years, and ‘excess savings meets disrupted supply chains’ means dislocation in supply and demand.”The reflation trade had hit a wall this month, with havens such as Treasuries rallying and cyclical shares underperforming as spikes in Covid-19 infection rates around the world forced renewed lockdowns in major economies. But the relentless rise in commodity prices has pushed inflation expectations out of their lull and some strategists expect the rally to continue.Goldman Says Commodities Will Power On as Oil Demand Leaps The sharp increases in the cost of materials are motivating companies such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to pass on costs to consumers -- moves that raise questions about the Fed’s assurances that any bump in inflation will be short-lived. The 10-year breakeven rate, a proxy for where investors see annual inflation rates over the next decade, topped 2.4% Tuesday -- the highest since April 2013.“There’s some skepticism there as to whether it is transitory, given the delays in supply chains and potentially some productive capacity destruction as a result of lockdowns,” said Anthony Doyle, global cross-asset investment specialist at Fidelity Investment Management in Sydney.Gundlach Says Fed Is Guessing That Inflation Will Be TransitoryStill, not everyone is ready to pile back into the reflation trades that gripped markets earlier this year. An MSCI Inc. gauge of global value shares -- which have high exposure to economic growth -- has lagged its more defensive growth counterpart by nearly 4 percentage points this month and has barely budged this week.BlackRock Inc. has turned neutral from overweight on U.S. inflation-linked bonds after the recent rebound in inflation expectations. The world’s largest asset manager has also cut its short positioning in Treasuries.BlackRock Cuts Inflation-Haven Bond Bet, Stays Bullish on StocksNevertheless, it’s harder to dismiss inflation risks given the positive surprises in recent economic reports.“All of the better data points to a higher-inflation narrative that the market is reflecting,” said Rob Daly, director of fixed income for Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia.(Updates throughout.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Reflation Trades Look to Revive Amid Global Commodities Fervor

2021-05-05,"(Bloomberg) -- The Honest Co., the personal care brand co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, raised $413 million in an initial public offering priced within a marketed range.The company and its shareholders on Tuesday sold about 25.8 million shares for $16 each, according to a statement confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. The shares had been marketed for $14 to $17, with the company offering 6.5 million shares and existing investors selling 19.4 million.The company has a market value at the IPO price of about $1.45 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Fully diluted to include employee stock options and restricted stock units, that value rises to more than $1.7 billion.Founded in 2011, Honest has grown into a national brand and has partnerships with retail giants including Target Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. The Los Angeles-based company specializes in baby products such as diapers and wipes, which accounted for 63% of last year’s sales, as well as household cleaning supplies and personal care items.Now the company’s chief creative officer, Alba owns 5.65 million shares. She didn’t plan to sell her shares in the offering, according to the filings. The share sale gives her a stake valued at about $90 million.Investors selling some of their shares in the IPO included private equity firm L Catterton, Institutional Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and General Catalyst, the filings show.Childhood AilmentsAlba has said she sought to find products with fewer harsh chemicals following childhood struggles with allergies and asthma. She became particularly concerned about ingredients in baby products and said in a recent filing that she tried to appeal to lawmakers for chemical legislation reform.Honest’s business touches on several trends that have become more prominent during the coronavirus pandemic, including a focus on wellness and elevated demand for cleaning products. Those have buoyed top-line results for household-goods companies such as Procter & Gamble Co., the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent.Los Angeles-based Honest generated sales last year of about $301 million, a 28% increase over 2019. It lost $14.5 million in 2020.Boom FadingAlready, though, the pandemic boom for consumer-products makers is starting to fade. P&G has acknowledged that rising costs are pressuring results, toilet paper maker Kimberly-Clark Corp. recently cut its earnings forecast and Clorox Co. last week missed Wall Street’s estimates for quarterly sales. In addition to shifting demand, manufacturers are grappling with higher commodity and freight costs.Honest said in the filing that it’s working to manage disruptions to its supply chain, but it anticipates “sustained market turmoil” as a result of the pandemic and its economic impact. “If the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic continue for an extended period of time, our ability to meet the demands of our consumers may be materially impacted.”The offering is being led by Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. The shares are expected to begin trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol HNST.(Updates with statement in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Jessica  Alba’s Honest Co., Investors Raise $413 Million in IPO"
