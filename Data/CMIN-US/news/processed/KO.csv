And, indeed, all of Berkshire&apos;s top 10 holdings - from Apple (AAPL) to Moody&apos;s Corporation (MCO) to Southwest Airlines (LUV) - pay dividends. Yields on these names are another matter. Buffett doesn&apos;t reach for yield any more than he chases performance. Apple, his favorite stock by far, sports of dividend yield of just 1.3% these days. It&apos;s not that Buffett is automatically allergic to above-average yields. (The dividend yield on the S&P 500 currently stands at 1.81%, according to Birinyi Associates.) Heck, the yields on Berkshires highest-yielding dividend stocks are anywhere from more-than-respectable to generous. There just aren&apos;t all that many big yielders.

2018-09-26,"The legality of cannabis - marijuana - within the United States is a gray area. It&apos;s illegal in all forms at a federal level, but the nation&apos;s Drug Enforcement Agency and other law-enforcement arms have largely decided to turn a blind eye to states that have legalized cannabis one way or another. Nevertheless, the cannabis industry to date remains fragmented, served only by relatively small marijuana stocks and private companies that lose money more often than not. The missing ingredient: scale, or size. While so-called &quot;mom &apos;n&apos; pop&quot; shops may be able to eke out reliable profits, attempts at mass marketing have largely been fiscal failures. The cannabis business needs bigger backers if it&apos;s going to become a mass-market product. But Fortune 500 companies have mostly opted to steer clear given the inconsistent and unclear legalities. That&apos;s changing, though. A handful of large, prominent companies are signaling that this market is becoming big enough to address. Today, we&apos;ll give you a rundown of five blue-chip &quot;marijuana stocks&quot; to watch. Just note: These are enormous multinationals bringing in billions of dollars in revenues. Merely dipping a toe into the cannabis business won&apos;t make these stocks suddenly double overnight.

But it's 2019, and with the big bull market over, a company that makes coconut watermelon sodas, cold brew coffee, kombucha and tea looks a lot more speculative …

… Especially when you throw marijuana into the mix, which helped NBEV stock surge roughly 350% since mid-September.

Still, NBEV stock has been on a tear recently, even while the rest of the market was running from the bears. Since the Christmas Eve market massacre (which some analysts now call the bear market bottom) shares in NBEV are up 47%, and opened Tuesday at $7.45 per share, with another speculative run expected.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Is it really time to pay 10 times revenue for a company that makes niche drinks?

### It's a New Age

New Age Beverages' management is led by Brent Willis, who has run private equity-based companies for many years and knows his way around a deal. Deals are what a fast-growing company like New Age are all about, like a distribution agreement for Sunshine Beverages, which makes what it calls &quot;good energy&quot; drinks using ingredients like Clementine oranges, ginger and blueberries.

  * 8 Dividend Stocks With Growth on the Horizon 



The biggest deal for New Age, however, came in December, when it bought Morinda Holdings of Utah for $85 million; $75 million of it in cash.

Morinda uses multi-level marketing to get its product into consumers' hands, which includes its Tahitian noni juice products. Noni juice, derived from a tree native to Southeast Asia, is said to have wide-ranging health benefits and has been re-engineered by Morinda to improve the taste.

Before the deal, Morinda was claiming sales of $500 million but wasn't sharing its figures publicly. New Age had revenues of $52 million in 2017 and was on pace to only match that in 2018. With Morinda, New Age now claims it will have a run rate of $300 million in sales during 2019, with operations in over 60 countries.

Then there's marijuana.

Pot helped fuel New Age's gains in 2018, as it prepared to sell water with cannabidiol (CBD) added to it, which, thanks to the passage of the farm bill, could be on store shelves near you soon.

### The New Age Hype

What NBEV stock bulls harp on is the company's revenue growth and gross profits.

For the first nine months of 2018, New Age had revenues of $38 million, and gross profits of about $7 million. Growing to $300 million would be massive, and the company claims the Morinda deal will provide $10 million in cost and revenue synergies.

The hype train claims you already have a $300 million company, preparing to enter a marijuana market where companies often trade for over five times revenue, and how can you lose?

Well, you can.

Morinda's health claims may not be all they appear to be, especially if they're using multi-level marketing. New Age Beverages existing lineup is extremely niche (grapefruit-sage kombucha?). And the idea of putting CBD into sodas sounds, at minimum, speculative, considering the unregulated nature of the CBD industry. As for health benefits, the only actual, FDA-approved treatment, Epidiolex, is for epilepsy, which GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH) owns. Any other claim is speculative at best, bogus at worst.

### Bottom Line on NBEV Stock

It is often noted that Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) started life in the 1880s as a patent medicine containing cocaine, which wasn't removed until the first decade of the 20th century. The fizzy water business, in other words, has a checkered history.

New Age is a hark back to that history. In order to create new niches, and grab new consumers, the company is throwing lots of strange and interesting drinks at people and making some big claims.

If Morinda has a stable business; if New Age Beverages can get out a legit CBD beverage; if it can build its distribution; if it can scale globally … only then is NBEV stock a bargain.

2019-01-16,"The financial markets had a turbulent and volatile 2018, with many storylines and themes changing multiple times over the course of the year. But one financial market theme that remained constant through the volatility was a strong dollar.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, bottomed around 90 in early 2018 during global financial market turmoil. Over the rest of the year, the U.S. Dollar Index steadily gained towards the upper 90's, even amid the big selloff in late 2018.

This trend has changed course over the past month. Specifically, the U.S. Dollar Index peaked around 98 in mid-December, and has since consistently fallen towards 95, its lowest level since October. Why? There's renewed optimism regarding a trade war resolution, and hope that while the global economy is slowing, it's not slowing as much as feared. Also, the Fed has grown increasingly dovish over the past few weeks, signalling fewer rate hikes than previously anticipated.

But a weaker dollar is good news for some companies, such as multinationals with significant overseas sales exposure and foreign stocks with mitigated sales exposure to the U.S. Many of these stocks were hampered by a strong dollar in 2018. But, if the dollar continues to weaken in 2019, these stocks could have room to run higher as a major headwind is removed from the equation.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



With this in mind, let's take a look at seven stocks to buy as the U.S. dollar weakens.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: McDonald's (MCD)

Source: Shutterstock 

At the top of the list is McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the multinational food giant which not only gets a majority of its revenue and profits from international markets, but whose international operations are also more profitable and growing faster. Therefore, as the dollar weakens and those businesses start to earn more in term of U.S. dollars, MCD stock should benefit.

Last year, roughly 65% of the company's total revenues and nearly 60% of total operating profits came from outside of the U.S. Moreover, comparable sales growth in the U.S. was just 3.6% last year, versus 5% and up overseas. Also, U.S. company operated margins hovered around 16% in 2017. International company operated margins were north of 17%.

Overall, as goes the international business, so goes McDonald's. Thus, as the international business becomes increasingly valuable against a weakening dollar, MCD stock should naturally rise.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Alibaba (BABA)

Source: Shutterstock 

The plunge in Chinese stocks started in early 2018, when the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the Chinese yuan. That strengthening diluted the value of U.S. listed Chinese stocks, and that dilution -- on top of concerns regarding weakening growth -- caused all Chinese stocks to drop in a big way. That included shares of Chinese internet giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).

But the fundamentals underlying Alibaba remain very strong. This is still the premiere e-commerce and cloud company in a 6%-plus growth economy supported by healthy demographic trends. Despite those tailwinds, the stock now trades at a rather anemic sub-30x forward multiple (revenues grew by over 50% last quarter).

  * 7 Oversold Small-Cap Stocks With Massive Profit Growth 



All this stock needs to explode higher is a few good catalysts. One such catalyst is a weakening dollar. The other is positive progress on U.S.-China trade talks. Those two are tied together, and both are starting to move in favor of Alibaba. As such, now seems like as good a time as any for a big BABA stock around.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Baidu (BIDU)

Source: Shutterstock 

Another Chinese stock that plunged with a strengthening U.S. dollar but is now set to rebound as the dollar weakens is Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).

For those who are unaware, Baidu is the company behind China's leading search engine, and as such, is often called the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of China. As the Google of China, Baidu has established itself as the backbone of China's burgeoning internet economy. There have been some hiccups in the road, but the company has always successfully navigated around them and -- much like Google- - Baidu has found itself as a largely consistent 20%-plus revenue grower.

At current levels, BIDU stock is pretty cheap with a mere 15x forward multiple. Google trades at over 20x forward earnings, and Google is growing revenues at a slower clip than Baidu. Thus, the 15x forward multiple on BIDU stock doesn't make much sense and should ultimately be corrected with a few positive catalysts.

One such positive catalyst will be the weakening of the U.S. dollar. If dollar weakness persists and U.S.-China trade talks continue to make progress towards a resolution, BIDU stock could be in store for a major rally from multi-year lows.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Coca Cola (KO)

Source: Coca-Cola

One multinational giant that is set to benefit in a sizable way from U.S. dollar weakness is Coca Cola (NYSE:KO).

Much like McDonald's, most of Coca-Cola's revenues, profits, and growth come from international markets. Specifically, last year, only ~25% of the company's revenues came from North America. Presumably, most of that was from the United States. Still, at most, the U.S. represented just about 20% of Coca-Cola's total revenues in 2017. Roughly a third of operating profits came from North America, so maybe about 25% came from the U.S. Meanwhile, volume growth in North America was flat, while it was positive in some other international geographies.

Broadly speaking, then, the KO growth story is one led and driven by international growth. As the dollar weakens, that international growth becomes more valuable in terms of U.S. dollars, and the entire KO growth story becomes more valuable, too. As such, dollar weakness should lead to a KO stock rally.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Netflix (NFLX)

Source: Shutterstock 

Although this stock is often viewed as being in a different category than McDonald's and Coca Cola, streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) actually shares a few prominent parallels with the aforementioned consumer staples giants. Namely, all three are international driven growth stories that benefit from a weaker dollar.

Netflix is still growing by leaps and bounds in the U.S. But, the majority of the growth is happening outside of the U.S. Last quarter, the U.S. streaming business grew revenues by 25% with just over 1 million net ads. In contrast, the international streaming business grew revenues by nearly 50% with almost 6 million net ads. Also, when investors and analysts talk about how big Netflix can be, those discussions almost entirely revolve around the international market, since the consensus belief is that the U.S. market is nearing saturation.

Overall, Netflix is a multinational giant with an international driven growth story. As such, this company and stock are winners when the dollar weakens.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Tesla (TSLA)

Source: Tesla 

When talking about growth giants with international driven growth stories, streaming giant Netflix and electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fall into the same boat.

Tesla had a breakthrough back half of 2018 as the company achieved a sizable profit for the first time in several years -- and did so while accelerating Model 3 production and delivery to mainstream levels. But all those positive developments happened almost entirely on the domestic front. The Model 3 has yet to really scratch the surface internationally.

  * 5 Fallen-Angel Stocks That Have Been Oversold 



That will change in 2019. One of Tesla's biggest focus is producing and delivering Model 3 vehicles all around the world this year. As the company does this, the TSLA growth narrative will become increasingly internationally driven. The more internationally driven this growth narrative becomes, the more a weak dollar will help TSLA stock.

### Stocks to Buy as the Dollar Weakens: Weibo (WB)

Source: Shutterstock 

Back to the list of Chinese stocks to buy before they benefit from a weaker dollar. There is a lesser known but just as compelling Chinese stock: social-media giant Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).

Many investors and analysts like to call Weibo the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) of China, given overlaps in the companies' core social media platforms. Those comparisons make sense. But, Weibo is much bigger (nearly 450 million monthly active users versus under 330 million at Twitter). Weibo is also growing more quickly (44% revenue growth last quarter, versus 29% at Twitter), and is more profitable (42% adjusted EBITDA margins last quarter, versus 39% at Twitter).

Despite Weibo being bigger, faster growing, and more profitable, Twitter stock is deemed more valuable and expensive by the market. Weibo has a $12 billion market cap. Twitter is valued at essentially twice that. Weibo stock trades at 17 forward earnings. Twitter's forward multiple is above 35.

Overall, Weibo stock is just way too cheap to ignore here. And all it will take for a rip-your-face-off rally is a few positive catalysts. A weakening U.S. dollar is one. Positive trade talks is another. Stabilizing economic growth in China is a third. If all those boxes get checked off, this stock could soar in a big way.

As of this writing, Luke Lango was long BIDU, GOOG, NFLX, TSLA, WB, and TWTR.

  * 10 Hot Stocks to Buy Right Now 



As a result, a number of large-cap stocks are pushing strongly higher as the major indices hold above critical resistance levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has spent three days above its 50-day moving average and looks ready to close in on its 200-day average next.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In anticipation, here are five large-cap stocks to watch:

### Comcast (CMCSA)

Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) shares have punched up and over their 50-day moving average to return to the highs last seen in early December. This after a bounce on the 20-day average on Tuesday. Watch for a run at the prior high of $39.50, which would be worth a gain of roughly 7% from here.

The company reported results before the bell this morning. Earnings of 64 cents per share beat estimates by a penny on a 26.1% rise in revenues thanks to a 5.2% increase in Cable Communications sales. Previously, the company reported on Oct. 25 with earnings of 65 cents per share beating estimates by 4 cents on a 5% rise in revenues.

### Procter & Gamble (PG)

Shares of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are pushing to fresh highs, testing above the $96-a-share level, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results and raising forward guidance. Earnings of $1.25 per share were a 5% increase from the prior year driven by a lower tax rate. Organic sales growth clocked in at 4%, which is healthy in this environment.

  * 10 Consumer Stocks to Buy for Income 



Looking ahead, management raised the upper end of their organic sales growth guidance by 1% to a range of 2% to 4% for fiscal 2019. The company seems to be avoiding issues such as price pressure and higher transport costs hitting competitors like Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB).

### United Technologies (UTX)

United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) shares are on the move in a big way, testing above their 50-day moving average and marking a near-20% rise off of the late December low. Watch for prices to chase down the 200-day average, which would be worth another 10% move from here.

The company reported results this morning before the bell. Earnings of $1.95 per share beat estimates by 42 cents on a 15.1% rise in revenues. Forward guidance was raised above estimates as well. Previously, the company reported on Oct. 23 with earnings of $1.93 per share beating estimates by 42 cents on a 15.1% rise in revenues.

### Starbucks (SBUX)

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) shares have been a rare bright spot for the market, rising steadily since the summer, they have shrugged off the nastiness seen elsewhere. SBUX stock is back over its 50-day moving average and is closing in on its prior high set in November. This comes despite a downgrade by Goldman Sachs earlier this month.

  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Lost 20% Over Past 90 Days 



The company will next report results on Jan. 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 66 cents per share on revenues of $6.5 billion. When the company last reported on Nov. 1, earnings of 62 cents per share beat estimates by 2 cents on a 10.6% rise in revenues.

### Coca-Cola (KO)

Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) shares are rising out of a two-month consolation base, setting the stage for a run at the 50-day moving average. A return to the prior highs would be worth a 4% gain from here. Analysts at UBS resumed coverage on the stock back in December with a Buy rating. CEO James Quincey was also on CNBC last month discussing the potential for a cannabis infused drink.

The company will next report results on Feb. 14 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 43 cents per share on revenues of $7.1 billion. When the company last reported on Oct. 30, earnings of 58 cents per share beat estimates by 3 cents despite a 9.2% drop in revenues.

As of this writing, William Roth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.&quot;

No doubt, this focus on long-term stocks has worked out extremely well for him. Buffett is worth a staggering $81 billion. He has also done this by generally avoiding the high-growth areas of the markets, such as tech stocks.

  * 7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy Now 



OK then, in light of all this, what are some stocks to buy right now -- and to hold on to for the long term? Let's take a look at five:

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Alibaba (BABA)

Lately the Chinese economy has come under pressure as President Trump's tariffs have taken a toll. But the long-term prospects still look bright. The number of people in China's middle class is expected to hit 600 million by 2022 (this compares to the total population in the US of 320 million). In fact, according to research from Standard Chartered Bank, China is on track to become the world's largest economy next year.

A good way to play this? Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which is the largest e-commerce operator in China. Even with the slowdown in the country, Alibaba is still finding ways to keep up the heady growth. In the latest quarter, revenues spiked by 56% to $10.5 billion.

Over the years, BABA has expanded away from just e-commerce. It's as if the company has been following the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) playbook. For example, BABA has a thriving cloud computing business. During Q3, revenues soared by 90% to $825 million.

Despite all the growth, BABA stock still is relatively cheap (primarily because the shares have taken a big hit during the market selloff). Note that the forward price-to-earnings multiples is 23X. To put things into perspective, JD.com (NADAQ:JD) trades at 40X and AMZN is at 63X.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: AT&T (T)

AT&T (NYSE:T) is certainly a company that has been durable. It helps that it has focused on businesses that provide recurring revenues. But T has also had a proven long-term track record of transforming itself, such as going from landlines to mobile.

Despite all this, Wall Street has not been too upbeat about the company. Since late 2017, T stock has gone from $39 to $30.

But I think this has set up a nice entry point -- at least for those looking for a long-term stock. The main reason is that T stock should benefit nicely from another transformation of the business: the $81 billion acquisition of Time-Warner.

With the deal, the company gets a wide assortment of entertainment assets like the WB movie studios, HBO and Turner. These businesses will bring in over $31 billion in annual revenues, with high margins.

But T has the benefit of its massive mobile footprint for distribution. And this will be key for its upcoming launch of a streaming platform, which will have three huge categories (movies, original programming and the Warner film library). As seen with the huge success of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), streaming is a strong secular growth trend as consumers want more choices and affordable prices.

Finally, T stock is trading at dirt-cheap levels, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 8.5x. There is also a juicy dividend yield of 6.7%.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Coca-Cola (KO)

With the trend towards healthier diets, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) does seem vulnerable. But it is important to note that the company has been evolving. An example of this is Coca-Cola Zero. There has also been the reinvigoration of brands like Sprite and Fanta, which include no-or-low calorie recipes.

But the company is also expanding into other drink categories. One is Smartwater, which has been a fast grower. Then there is the move into energy drinks as well as the acquisitions of Organic & Raw Trading (the developer of the MOJO kombucha brand), Tropico (the creator of various fruit-flavored beverages) and Costa (a UK-based retail coffee chain).

All in all, the strategy has worked quite well. Just look at Q3, in which organic revenues increased by 6% and sales volume was up 2%. As for profits, they came to $1.88 billion, up from $1.45 billion on a year-over-year basis.

Oh and of course, Buffett is the top holder of KO stock. He currently owns a hefty 400 million shares.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Procter & Gamble (PG)

Few companies have had the staying power of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which got its start back in 1837. P&G initially focused on selling candles and soap, and the company would not reach $1 million in revenues until 1858.

Fast forward to today: PG generates about $67 billion on the top line and has a market value of $225 billion.

Granted, during the past few years, there has been issues at the company, which involved a tough fight with activist investor Nelson Peltz. Yet regardless of the drama, it looks like things are headed in the right direction. PG has been cutting costs, paring down the bureaucracy and focusing more on innovation.

The result is that PG is posting strong growth. In the latest quarter, organic sales increased by 4% (this was the highest in four years). There was strength across all the categories. As for the profits, they rose by 12% to $3.2 billion or $1.22 per share.

  * 5 Terrific Tech Stocks That Will Make You Forget About FANG 



The dividend for PG stock is also attractive, at 3.2%. The company has increased the payout for 62 consecutive years.

### Best Long-Term Stocks To Buy: Exxon Mobil (XOM)

The oil industry can be extremely volatile, as seen during the past year with crude prices. Yet Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has a diverse, integrated platform that generally provides stability. The company has extensive upstream (oil exploration, extraction and production) and downstream (marketing, refining and retail) assets.

Now it's true that when it comes to production, XOM has struggled. But the company is making progress. Keep in mind that there continues to be traction in the Permian basin as well as with offshore developments, such as in Brazil, Guyana and Angola.

In the meantime, XOM continues to crank out significant profits. During the latest quarter, they spiked by 57% to $6.24 billion. The dividend is also standout, at 4.6%. The company has raised it an average of 6.2% a year for the past 36 years.

### NBEV Stock and CBD-Infused Drinks

Since mid-November, NBEV has more than doubled in value. In that time, interest in the market has risen. Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) has partnered with Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) to research cannabis drinks. The U.S. has also legalized hemp. This allows New Age to sell CBD-infused beverages in all 50 states.

As the maker of Aspen Pure, Xing Energy, and Bucha Live Kombucha, it would not make for a particularly exciting stock. However, its Marley+CBD Mellow Mood brand could become a game changer.

This CBD-infused drink will first become available in four states with legalized cannabis. Now, success in those states could lead to its availability nationwide soon. Moreover, its CFO Gregory Gould comes in with a biotech and life sciences background. Such knowledge gives NBEV a leg up in bringing CBD-infused products to market.

### NBEV Faces an Uncertain Market

Infused beverages have seen a mixed history. As my colleague Dana Blankenhorn points out, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) got its start in infused beverages as it contained cocaine for a brief part of its history.

Also, as our own Will Ashworth reminds us, NBEV could follow the path of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). This company, formerly known as Hansen's Natural Corporation, changed its name due to the success of its energy drink.

Still, for every Monster Beverage-type success, we see multiple stories comparable to that of Jones Soda (OTCMKTS:JSDA). Their use of unique flavors dazzled the market for a time, but an attempted move into the canned soda market pushed it back into obscurity.

So this begs the question of whether NBEV will follow the path of MNST or JSDA? The short answer is &quot;we do not know.&quot; This leaves NBEV in the realm of speculation.

### Will NBEV Lead the Way?

Still, I think the speculation lies in company execution more than in its product. The Tilray-InBev alliance focuses on research. Also, the investment by Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has not yet brought a CBD-infused beverage to market. Hence, NBEV appears poised to take the first-mover advantage.

This could help establish a moat, at least from a brand perspective.

Investors should also remember that even though Monster's lead product holds a smaller market share than Red Bull, MNST still became a $30-plus billion company. With New Age's new product, the $510 million NBEV could become the Monster or Red Bull of CBD-infused drinks.

Still, these beverages have now become legal nationwide. Hence, it will have to get its product out to the 50 states and beyond quickly. It will also have to build a loyal customer base that will remain as peers roll out competing products.

We do not yet know which companies will lead the way in this market. Also, whether consumers show a sustained interest in CBD-infused drinks remains unknown. However, if New Age Beverage stock can make itself the investment name in CBD-infused beverages, it could enjoy a bright future.

### The Bottom Line on NBEV Stock

Although speculative, CBD-infused drinks could become the product that sends NBEV stock higher in the years to come. Thanks to hemp legalization, New Age can now offer CBD-infused products across the country.

NBEV stock has risen in recent weeks following hemp achieving legal status. However, with this industry in its infancy, it remains unclear whether New Age Beverage stock will become the Monster Beverage of CBD-infused drinks.

New Age has a new product and a leadership team with experience in a related industry. However, it must move quickly to have any hope of establishing a brand moat before competitors enter the market.

Still, if one holds some speculative cash and believes in the management team, they might see huge gains over the next few years by buying NBEV stock.

As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

The stocks' moves are extreme, in both directions, and they're being fed purely by sentiment. These swings can be difficult for investors emotionally, as they suffer paper losses and enjoy enormous gains, but that's exactly what traders like to see.

  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday 



So what's been happening to CRON stock? Cronos Group stock went from about $10 to about $13 after it was announced that Altria (NYSE:MO) would take a $1.8 billion stake in CRON. That news came on Dec. 7, but by Christmas, CRON stock was back down to $10.

Once the market started to rebound from its Christmas Eve lows, Cronos Group stock really flew. Now, with Cronos Group stock over $21 per share, some are wondering if it's too late to buy the shares.

### Evaluating CRON

Cronos Group has been in focus lately because of a few of its positive catalysts. First, cannabis stocks have regained momentum recently, with names like Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), New Ages Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) and others shifting into &quot;rally mode.&quot;

Second, after a large, well-known firm takes a multi-billion stake in a company, the company's stock price usually rises. That's been the case with CRON stock. Altria is buying $1.8 billion of Cronos Group stock in exchange for 40% of its equity. It has a warrant to buy another 10% stake at a premium of about 17% to its initial purchase price.

The strategic-equity investment leaves investors in a conundrum: Cannabis stocks, generally speaking, are overvalued when viewed in the context of the next 12 to 24 months. Beyond that point, though, many may feel they are undervalued compared to their potential over the next three to five years.

With Altria investing $1.8 billion in the space, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) spending $4 billion on its own cannabis investment, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in talks with Aurora Cannabis and Tilray developing products with Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) and Sandoz, a unit of Novartis (NYSE:NVS), it's logical for investors to feel optimistic about the sector's future.

### Trading CRON Stock

With all that said, it's no wonder CRON has been shooting higher. When big-name international companies are taking big stakes in a stock, demand for the shares obviously rises. When demand goes up, so does the share price.

After almost hitting $22 on Friday and grazing $25 on Monday, CRON stock is clearly in demand, even though it's down around 4.5% in early-afternoon trading today. However, Cronos Group stock  does look a bit toppy over $20.

If investors went long CRON stock near $10, they've more than doubled their money. Taking profits is hard to do if investors think the stock could rise further. To make it easier, investors can consider using a trailing stop-loss, thereby ensuring that they will keep the bulk of their gains but giving them the opportunity to ride the stock higher.

Those who aren't long CRON yet should wait. With an RSI reading of about 89, it's clear that Cronos Group stock is overbought in the short-term.

That doesn't make Cronos an outright sell or a short, but investors should keep in mind that the rally is a little long in the tooth. On a pullback of CRON stock, look to see if its short-term uptrend support, depicted by the blue line on the chart, holds. If not, l am curious to see if the support level around $18, which was previously a consolidation zone, holds up.

2019-02-13,"Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) recently launched Orange Vanilla Coke, an offshoot of the hugely successful Cherry Coke and Vanilla Coke products. It is the first new variant of Coca-Cola in more than 10 years. However, before you go out and buy Coca-Cola stock, you might want to consider both sides of the argument.While there's no question that Coke is an iconic brand worldwide, it's hard to get behind a stock that's generated an annualized total return of 8.4% over the past three years, 7.9% over the last five years, and 11.5% over the past 10 years. By comparison, the S&P 500 has managed annualized total returns of 16.3%, 10.5%, and 14.9% over the past three, five and 10 years respectively. That's an average beat by the index of 463 basis points. It hasn't even been close. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo some, the launch of a third variety is a sign the company has run out of ideas. To others, it's an indication the Atlanta-based beverage maker is prepared to innovate its way to growth.  * 9 U.S. Stocks That Are Coming to Life Again For me, I've never been a big fan of Coca-Cola stock. However, I can quickly come up with seven reasons to own KO. Here they are in no particular order of importance. Warren Buffett Owns Coca-Cola StockOnce upon a time, Coca-Cola would have been the Oracle of Omaha's largest equity holding. That distinction falls to Tim Cook and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) these days. According to the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Portfolio Tracker, Apple stock is number one at $43 billion, $23 billion higher than Coca-Cola, which is the fourth-largest. It's still a pretty significant holding, with only Apple, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) ahead of it. Last May, Buffett did admit that Coca-Cola's not looking as attractive as it did a decade ago due to changing diets and less royalty from consumers. Despite that admission, Berkshire Hathaway remains the company's largest stockholder holding 9.4% of its outstanding shares.As long as Warren Buffett is the largest shareholder of Coke, I think it's safe to say your investment's in good hands. KO Stock Has a Good DividendKO stock currently pays a quarterly dividend of 39 cents, which works out to $1.56 on an annual basis, and yields 3.1%. In Coke's third quarter, it earned 58 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis, making its payout ratio a reasonable 67% of net income, leaving plenty to reinvest in its business.Through the first nine months of fiscal 2018, Coca-Cola paid out $3.3 billion in dividends, $156 million more than in the same period a year ago. By comparison, it repurchased $1.6 billion in the first nine months, almost half what it did ($3.1 billion) a year earlier.  * Buy These 5 Stocks to Play the Megatrend of the Century Oh, and if you're concerned about it raising its dividend in 2019 and beyond, don't be because Coca-Cola has increased the dividend for 56 consecutive years. There are Dividend Aristocrats. And there's Coke. It's not glamorous, but it gets the job done. It's a Contrarian PlayIf there's one thing I know about Coca-Cola stock, it's this: It's not unanimously loved by analysts. According to the Wall Street Journal, of the 25 analysts covering its stock, 12 consider it a buy, two have it overweight and the 11 remaining analysts give it a hold rating. The good news is that no analysts rate it underweight or sell. The overall consensus of the 25 analysts is overweight KO stock. However, the average 12-month target price is $52.13, an upside of just under 5%. In 2018, while most stocks were falling, Coca-Cola managed to eke out a small gain of 2.9% while PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) lost 8%. Investors were looking for yield and safety, and Coke provided both. Already a month-and-a-half into 2019, the reality is that many investors don't view Coca-Cola stock as nearly the safe bet it once was -- thanks to the changing food habits noted by Buffett and many others -- and are moving on. As a result, I consider Coca-Cola stock the ideal contrarian play. 2018 Was Good to Coca-Cola StockAs I mentioned in the previous slide, investors' flight to safety in 2018, helped KO stock stay out of the way of a falling stock market. However, if you look at the company's financials, I think it's fair to say that it didn't do too badly on the only scorecard that counts: the income statement. On the top line, the company's revenues through the first nine months of fiscal 2019, fell 11% to $24.8 billion. However, Coca-Cola is in the process of going asset-light, selling its bottling operations to new franchisees like Toronto Maple Leafs part-owner Larry Tanenbaum, who acquired the Canadian bottling operations in 2018 with partner Junior Bridgeman, for approximately $800 million. While this process takes money from the top line, it solidifies the balance sheet and cash flow, allowing KO to ratchet up growth without a massive capital infusion. Organically, however, it has been a different story so far in 2018, with revenues growing 6% year over year in Q3 2018 and 5% through the first nine months of the year.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months On the bottom line, on an adjusted basis, Coke increased its operating income by 20% in the third quarter and 12% through the first nine months of the fiscal year. Add in lower income taxes and Coca-Cola's net income increased by 48% in the first nine months of the year.  Less revenue. More profits. Not a bad tradeoff. The Coffee BusinessOn Jan. 3, 2019, Coca-Cola completed its $4.9 billion acquisition of Costa Coffee, a deal it first announced at the end of August. The coffee segment of the beverage industry is growing at 6% annually on a global basis. By acquiring the UK coffee business, Coke can capture a big slice of a growing industry, at 16 times Costa's latest 12-month EBITDA. In the short term, investors might view this as expensive. However, long term, I believe Warren Buffett could look back at 2019 as the year Coca-Cola turned the tide and started growing again. If KO was to become a truly a hot and cold beverages company, the acquisition of Costa was a no-brainer for CEO James Quincey -- and Coca-Cola shareholders. KO's Free Cash FlowIn the first nine months of 2018, Coca-Cola's free cash flow decreased by 2% to $4.6 billion. Over the trailing 12 months through September, the company's free cash flow was $5.5 billion, close to the lowest level it's seen in over a decade.  However, as it moves to an asset-light business model, I could see Coke generating $6 billion-$7 billion in free cash flow, the amount it has historically thrown off on an annual basis, within the next 2-3 years. And as you may or may not know, dividends tend to get paid out of free cash flow along with all the other things a company can allocate capital to after it's covered what needs to be paid to keep the business running.  * 7 Reasons You Want Boeing Stock in Your Portfolio Without free cash flow, it's challenging for a business to grow. Coca-Cola is no exception. Potentially Game-Changing AcquisitionsThere aren't too many acquisitions that are game-changers. Costa Coffee could be the one for Coca-Cola. However, it's just as likely that a lot of gains in the future come from smaller tuck-in acquisitions that nobody pays attention to that strengthen the company's business. Consider its partnership with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST). Coke paid $2.15 billion in 2014 for a 16.7% stake in the energy drink leader. Coke got Monster's non-energy drink business and became Monster's most important distributor while Monster got Coke's energy business. Four years later, Coke owns 18.2% of Monster -- it has an option to go as high as 25% -- which is worth $6 billion. That's a nice 180% return on its investment. Most people in 2014 thought the deal was a good one, including myself. However, I'm not sure I ever thought Coke would see such a significant return. As companies grow, it takes bigger and bigger acquisitions to move the needle. Therefore, it's safe to assume we won't see another Costa-sized acquisition over the next 24-36 months. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if it bought some smaller, up-and-coming brands. Those are the ones whose value tend to sneak up on you.

2019-02-14,"Stocks looked set for more gains in pre-market trading before opening lower on weaker-than-expected retail sales. Stocks recovered their losses by midday trading, as bears weren't able to crack the markets too badly. That sets us up for a few must-see stock trades going into Friday. Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is having a pretty rough day, especially as its investors aren't too accustomed to 7.5% one-day pullbacks. After in-line earnings results and a beat on revenue, management provided a cautious outlook that sent shares reeling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's hard to deny that $50 was clearly resistance in this name, but there could be some debate about support. Some will say KO has already dropped through it at $46.50. Others will say support still rests down at $46. Within 50 cents of each other and I say it's a wash.  * The 10 Best ETFs You Can Buy Notably, we also have the 200-day nearby at $45.62. Those who want to take a stab at Coca-Cola stock should keep these levels in mind. A close below the 200-day and traders may want to rethink their position. Keep in mind, PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) reports earnings on Friday before the open. CyberArk (CYBR)Acting as the complete opposite, CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) is soaring on the day after a very impressive earnings report. Shares are up 20% as a result (and good call Will Healy).Now investors are wondering where it can rally to. Short of a market-wide breakdown, CYBR has room above $110, with trend resistance still a little ways above current levels.On the downside, should CYBR pullback, look to see if it can stay over Thursday's low. If it can't, see how it handles uptrend support (purple line). Canada Goose (GOOS)Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) hammered earnings, and that's putting it lightly. Revenue of ~$400 million grew 50% year-over-year and smashed estimates by more than $130 million. Guidance was solid too.Despite all this, shares are down about 11%. Shares are now technically below the 200-day, but have the 21-day and 50-day moving averages just below current levels. Further, its got short-term uptrend support nearby too.Those who feel this is the wrong reaction and/or an overreaction to what were truly great results may consider this a buying opportunity. Below $50 and a drop down to $46 to $47 isn't out of the question, and possibly further.  * 7 Best of the Best Fidelity Funds to Buy Conservative traders who don't mind buying even though we're heading into the spring and summer seasons instead of the fall and winter seasons may consider waiting a few days to see if buyers step in first. S&P 500 ETF (SPY)The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is one we should look at now given how well the market has done since the December lows. A lot of investors were focused on possible downtrend resistance (blue line), but I didn't like that look.Why? Because it feels cherry picked and felt forced on the charts to justify a negative view. Plus, it's an inaccurate trend, but I digress. Instead, I continue to focus on the $280 level, a mark that SPY failed at three times in October, November and December. If we get there in a relatively quick amount of time, it will also likely push the RSI (green circle) into overbought territory.A rally to this level would be my ideal scenario and give investors a solid risk/reward for some profit taking and/or possible shorting opportunities. The exception is if we get there via a trade deal with China. If that happens, $280 may prove to be feeble resistance. CenturyLink (CTL)Not that it was surprisingly with a near-15% yield, but CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) stock is getting pummeled on Thursday after axing its dividend to $1 a share from $2.16. Shares are down about 12% in response, but according to the charts, they could have further room to fall.The downtrend (blue line) told investors all they needed to know leading up to this gut-punch. Now below $14 and shares are in no man's land until $12. Maybe buyers will step in near $12.50, but there seems to be little reason to hop on board into such a route.  * 7 Reasons Stock Buybacks Should Be Illegal Let CTL wash out and let's see if $12 holds.

2019-02-14,"To say that the Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock came out of the gate strong is the understatement of the decade. The stock got caught in a whirlwind trade that made instant millionaires but left many broken accounts. The rise was so fast that the shorts were decimated. Then the fall was equally impressive and surely caught late-comers stuck long.Source: Shutterstock Since then, the mania has abated but it still is an exciting stock to watch. It is now more than 70% off its highs on Sept. 19, 2018, but it still carries the aura of last year. Critics would argue that fundamentally, Tilray stock is grossly overvalued from a traditional standpoint. It has a market cap of $7 billion with only $20 million in revenues.But this is not a traditional stock. While I am not here to judge it for value, the bullish thesis here resembles that of Tesla a few years ago. Bulls have an array of reasons why TLRY has tremendous potential down the road. The cannabis stocks are levitating here for a whole host of reasons. Some see medicinal applications, while others expect mainstream companies like Coke (NYSE:KO) or Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) to promote the recreational cannabis-infused drinks. There is also the edible area which is already in full bloom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Looking Into Tilray StockI am not here to judge what's right or wrong from the ethical aspect. Nor am I here to judge the thesis. I can clearly see that the thesis is popular to the point that it is almost impossible to kill it here. As long as this is true, there will be a bid under cannabis stocks like TLRY.For those who believe strongly in the sector, they should just buy and hold the stocks for the long term. Personally, for that plan I'd prefer Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC). This way I can piggy back off the homework of Constellation (NYSE:STZ) and their $4 billion investment in CGC.For the traders among us, we can refer to price to learn the truth. The charts give us all the information that we need to find trigger levels up or down, then set a clear plan of action.My observation is that TLRY stock is too quiet here. For momentum stocks like this, this only means that a move is coming and direction is unknown. More to that point, the range of prices tightened severely in February. The last time we had a similar situation was on Jan. 7. What ensued was a giant 30% rally.While this is not a guarantee that history will repeat itself, the price action is similar. The range tightened between Dec. 20 and Jan. 7 and then the stock blow up. It is definitely worth an attempt at a trade.  Click to Enlarge The upside triggers are $78.30, $79.54 and $88.70. Each should bring some resistance, but then if the bulls break through them they invite more buyers to join. Now we have a higher low and lower high trading sequence coming into a point. This won't last, so traders must be fast.I don't normally condone jumping the gun, but Tilray stock might be hard to grab it if it starts moving. I am also not reckless, so it is probably a good idea to use options to get in for little money. I'd use March contracts or longer for this.TLRY is probably reporting earnings soon, and that is definitely an unpredictable short-term catalyst. First, we don't know what they will deliver. And second, we don't know how markets will react to the report. This is more reason to use smaller out-of-pocket expense in options.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-02-14,"U.S. stocks opened solidly lower Thursday morning after lackluster economic reports overshadowed optimism over progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell about 205 points to 25339, a decline of 0.8%, the S&P 500 index  fell 0.7% to reach 2,734, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  declined by 0.5% to 7,384. The retail sales report is likely to weigh on the government's official scorecard for the economy known as gross domestic product, with fears of a recession looming. Retail sales sank 1.2% in December, the U.S. Census Bureau said Thursday. It's the largest drop since September 2009, a few months after the end of the Great Recession. A note from analysts at Jefferies, immediately after the retail sales report, referred to it as &quot;dreadful&quot; and questioned the reliability of the data. The market had been set for gains on optimism over progress between China and the U.S. as reports indicated that Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer on Friday, as the countries attempt to resolve longstanding trade differences that have roiled markets.

2019-02-15,"Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock dropped sharply yesterday after the consumer-staples giant reported fourth-quarter numbers that were largely in-line with expectations. But KO also issued cautious guidance for fiscal 2019 which seemed to incorporate slowing global economic trends and persistent foreign-exchange headwinds, causing KO stock to decline from $50 to $45.KO stock was trading right near its all-time highs heading into the Q4 print. But its results were pretty good, as its organic sales rose 5% and its operating profits rose 11%.In that context, the decline of Coca-Cola stock looks like a buying opportunity. Everything is still going well for KO. The company is continuing to pivot from a soda-focused brand to a multi-beverage brand that is much more relevant to today's health-conscious consumers. That transition is powering consistent, healthy revenue growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market's Blitz Higher Meanwhile, KO has exercised disciplined cost control, pushing its margins higher. The result of these trends is healthy, steady revenue and profit growth.This healthy, steady top-line and bottom-line growth will ultimately power Coca-Cola stock higher. KO stock was trading at a premium valuation heading into the print, supported by unreasonably high expectations. Now expectations are lower, and Coca-Cola stock is cheaper. Thus, now is the right time to buy KO stock. Q4 Numbers Were Good, But Not GreatCoca-Cola's Q4 numbers were good. But they weren't great or anything special. Instead, they were more of the same stable revenue and profit growth that this company has reported over the past several quarters and years.Thus, in the big picture, Coca-Cola's top-line growth trajectory has largely stabilized around 4%, excluding acquisitions. The problem was that, when KO stock was around $50, some investors were hoping that 5% and up sales growth was the new norm. That isn't the case. Fiscal 2018 was just an unusually good year. Next year (and likely for the foreseeable future), organic sales growth  (i.e. excluding the impact of acquisitions) will be in the 3%-5% range.Meanwhile, excluding currency fluctuations, operating income rose 8% in the quarter, and 11% on a trailing-twelve-month basis. That is fairly consistent with what KO has reported over the past several quarters. This low double-digit percentage-operating-profit-growth-trajectory is projected to persist, too, as KO expects its operating profits to rise 10%-11% in 2019.Overall, KO's fourth-quarter numbers and its 2019 guidance underscore that Coca-Cola's growth outlook is stable, but largely below the company's 2018 results. That disappointed some investors who had bought KO stock last year. Coca-Cola's Long-Term Outlook Is HealthyIn the big picture, the long-term fundamentals of Coca-Cola remain healthy. All the post-earnings drop did was make Coca-Cola stock cheaper while showing that KO's fundamentals remain strong. Consequently, this dip of Coca-Cola stock is a buying opportunity.Coca-Cola has made a big shift over the past several years, transforming from a soda-focused brand with declining popularity and relevance to a multi-beverage brand with climbing popularity and relevance. As part of this transition, the company has added new iterations like Zero to the core Coca-Cola product lineup, while broadening the product portfolio to include a wide range of teas, coffees, sparkling drinks, and enhanced waters that resonate with today's health-conscious consumers.This pivot is working. It's driving consistent, steady mid-single-digit, organic sales growth. In tandem with management's cost control measures, the transformation is driving high-single digit percentage to low-double-digit-percentage operating-profit growth.None of the company's fundamentals has changed in the wake of its Q4 results. The company's organic revenues are expected to rise 4% in fiscal 2019, while its operating profits are expected to rise just over 10%.The only thing that has changed is the valuation of Coca-Cola stock. Heading into the print, KO stock was trading at nearly 23 times analysts' forward earnings estimate with a sub-3.2% dividend yield. Relative to historical standards, that's a big P/E multiple and a low yield for KO stock.Now, though, the valuation of Coca-Cola stock is much more &quot;normal&quot;. Its forward multiple is back around 20, which is roughly in-line with its average valuation over the last five years. The dividend yield has risen to 3.4%, above the average yield of KO stock over the last five years. Meanwhile, KO is still poised to deliver mid-single-digit-organic sales growth and grow its operating profit by about 10%.As a result, the decline of Coca-Cola stock is a buying opportunity. KO's fundamentals remain largely unchanged, while KO stock just went from slightly overvalued to slightly undervalued. The Bottom Line on Coca-Cola StockIn the big picture, Coca-Cola has a found a winning strategy: Acquiring relevant, popular brands, and distributing them around the globe. As long as this strategy continues to power mid-single-digit organic sales growth and operating-profit growth of about 10%, KO stock should be bought on dips.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long KO.

2019-02-15,"The bulls tried their best, but when push came to shove, they just didn't have enough fight. Spurred by just a few too many lackluster earnings reports, the S&P 500 ended yesterday's action down to the tune of 0.27%.The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) was one of those names with an alarming quarterly report. KO stock fell more than 8% on the heels of expected Q4 sales and profits, but a 2019 profit outlook that was considerably less than estimated. Centurylink (NYSE:CTL) ended the day even deeper in the red, though, sliding 13% after cutting its divided in half.There were a handful of winners, like Encana (NYSE:ECA), which advanced 2.2% in step with rising oil prices, and was up another percentage point in after-hours trading. In fact, there was more bullish volume than bearish volume on Thursday. There just wasn't enough buying interest in the right stocks to lift the market over the hump.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHeaded into the weekend, the stock charts of Davita (NYSE:DVA), BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) are of the most interest. Here's why, and what to look for. Fastenal Company (FAST)Back in October, Fastenal Company shares were in something of a freefall, After bumping into a long-standing resistance line in August, all signs pointed to a trip back to the lower edge of the trading range that has framed the volatile rally going back to 2016.  * Should You Buy, Sell, Or Hold These 7 Medical Cannabis Stocks? That never happened … at least not in full. Rather than making a complete pullback, FAST stock hit a low about halfway there, and then made a triple bottom and established a new support line in December.Now we're back at the long-term ceiling, and hinting at another bearish outcome. The question is, which floor is the one that will do the job?  Click to Enlarge • The trading range is framed by white dashed lines on both stock charts. We bumped into the upper one this week.• The newly developed intermediate-term floor is marked with a yellow dashed line, also on both stock charts.• The weekly chart's stochastic indicator is in overbought territory, which has also coincided with pullbacks; that's not a condition that lasts long. Davita (DVA)With nothing more than a quick glance, the 0.3% gain Davita dished out yesterday is little to cheer. Indeed, DVA has been suspiciously left out of the most of the post-December rally.A closer, second look at Thursday's action, though, sets the stage for renewed bullishness in light of the other clues that have materialized over the course of the past couple of weeks.  Click to Enlarge • While Thursday's gain was ho-hum, the intraday turnaround was telling. The bears had a chance to tip it over with the early move back under key short-term moving average lines, but the bulls weren't going to give up any ground.• And those bulls are certainly strong in number. Even beyond yesterday's volume surge behind the advance, the accumulation (buying) days have seen higher and higher volume.• There may be some brewing resistance around the $58.10 area, which is marked with a dashed blue line on both stock charts. BorgWarner (BWA)Finally, it's not said often enough, but there's a lot of value in spotting a surge in volatility from a particular stock, or index. When the war between the buyers and sellers heats up, it often signals a turning point.BorgWarner shares have been particularly volatile the past few days, in all the right places. It looked like the bears were going to take control last week, but the bulls made a strong statement yesterday. They also failed to move above the one key ceiling they really needed to clear, however, so the outcome of this skirmish hangs on the balance.Either way, some something big is likely to come from the melee.  Click to Enlarge • The big line in the sand is $41.50, plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts. That's where BorgWarner has peaked several times since October, and it was still trouble as of yesterday.• Also noteworthy, however, is how the purple 50-day moving average line has stepped up as a technical floor.• Even before yesterday's big gain, the bullish volume was brewing, suggesting the undertow is bullish. The stumble from last week, though on above-average volume, didn't take shape with a lot of bears' support.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-15,"In 2017 we had the Bitcoin craze and last year Wall Street was high on the cannabis trade. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), which is the largest Canadian company of its kind, took center stage when Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested $4 billion in it. This further legitimized the pot potential after an increase in the legalization trend. Since then, companies like Coke (NYSE:KO) have also been in pursuit of the pot of gold -- pun intended.The bullish thesis on cannabis is very broad. This makes it easy to accept and difficult to short. This also makes for some lofty expectations. Companies like Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) are perhaps two of the most expensive valuations I've seen. TLRY has a market caps of $7 billion on only $20 million of revenues, and CRON's is $3.9 billion on only revenues of $3 million.From that perspective, CGC stock is not that much cheaper -- except this one has a fortress balance sheet thanks to the STZ investment. What ever the potential opportunities they may see, they have the money to pursue them the proper way. Growth becomes attainable, and that is good reason to pay up for the stock now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWall Street is doing just that this morning, as the stock is moving 5% on the heels of the conference calls. Management reported earnings last night, and so far the reaction then was muted even though the report was solid. I caution that the stock move so far is still well below what was expected so investors could still change their mind today. But even then, this is the short term and the thesis for CGC stock is for the long term. CGC Stock EarningsThe report was strong on most metrics. They delivered triple-digit growth on sales and deliverable. They sold 10,100 Kg in the third quarter and that is a whopping 360% increase from the prior quarter. This is a steep ramp, and most of it was for recreational use. So the legalization trend has a significant impact on how much product CGC stocks can deliver.  * 10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market's Blitz Higher Therein lies the cannabis mania. More headlines on those fronts will surely drive the demand and stock price up.The sky's the limit since it's new territory. This potential has attracted mainstream large-cap companies like STZ, but others like KO have been looking as well, so they have yet to scratch the surface. Doubters of the sector should be careful here. Shorting a broad bullish thesis could bring financial ruin to staunch bears.Since there are so many opinion of future income streams for cannabis companies like CGC, it's hard to shoot them all down down. It would be like fighting a multi-headed snake. When you think you beat one argument, the stocks rally on another angle or point of view.So where is the growth going to come from next? With the legalization trend being so young, there will be exponential growth, from the direct-to-consumer sales through retail and online. And as more regions amend their laws to accept it, cannabis will expand its current product lines but also add more of the same.Currently the edibles, drinkables and medicinal are three of the most popular topics of discussion, I bet there will be dozens more soon to add to the list. This will broaden the scope of potential corporate acquirers like STZ did.The bottom line is that Canopy Growth stock should have no limit for as long as the stock market is rising. The quest for new uses of cannabis and the efforts to expand what's already on hand is too strong to stifle in the short term. That is why the stock moves so violently on a daily basis. The fear of missing out is too great. So those who missed the run the first few times can jump into the stock on dips.Technically, CGC stock behaves well, filling the chart patterns. As active a chart as it has, the breakdown and breakout levels have so far been predictable. It is now 85% higher than it was on Christmas and it is trading inside a tight range. This builds up pent-up energy that will need to resolve itself. This usually happens in a breakout or breakdown from significant levels.In this case, If Canopy stock loses $41.60, it could retest the $35 zone. Conversely and if the bulls can break through $48 then $52, they can invite enough momentum buyers to mount a $12 rally from there. In fact, CGC may already be in a breakout pattern with a measured move to $60 per share.Normally I want to wait for the breakout line to happen before I chase stocks. In this case, I would make an exception and buy get long CGC early because it is a fast mover. But I would put a tight stop below $41.60. I could do this using options, but even if I buy the stock outright, I would consider selling covered calls to mitigate my risk. Long term, this stock could be a massive home run, we just cannot quantify it yet and that is exciting and totally worth the risk.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-02-19,"U.S. stock futures are trading lower this morning after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched its eighth straight up week in a row. With the relentless recovery, some stock indexes are now within striking distance of their prior peaks.Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.23% and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.29%. Nasdaq-100 futures have shed 0.29%.Friday's market rally lit a fire under call demand and helped drive overall volume to above-average levels. Specifically, about 23.3 million calls and 17.5 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe euphoric dash for calls made waves at the CBOE with the single-session equity put/call volume ratio plunging to 0.52 -- a one-month low. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average slipped to a four-month low.Options activity was all about earnings on Friday. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) continued falling after missing revenue estimates and delivering poor 2019 guidance. Canopy Growth Corp (NASDAQ:CGC) reported sales growth that largely satisfied shareholders. Finally, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped despite poor earnings, but the initial up-gap was aggressively sold.Let's take a closer look: Coca-Cola (KO)Weakness continued for the soda king on Friday, driving KO down just shy of 1% by day's end. The stock gapped higher and saw early morning strength, but the rally ultimately fizzled on continued angst surrounding its poor earnings release. Earlier in the week, Coca-Cola reported numbers that missed revenue estimates. The forward guidance also disappointed.  * 10 Hot Stocks Leading the Market's Blitz Higher With shares now beneath the 200-day moving average, sellers have full control here. The next two support zones are $44.50 and $41.50.On the options trading front, calls dominated the session despite the slide. Total activity grew to 465% of the average daily volume, with 170,263 total contracts traded. Calls accounted for 78% of the day's take.With earnings out of the way, the day-to-day volatility should return to a more normal pace. Implied volatility sits at 17%, or the 34th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 49 cents, or 1.1%. Canopy Growth Corp (CGC)The volatility in marijuana stocks continued on Friday, only this time it was an earnings-report-driving the drama. Canopy Growth Corp shares were up as much as 8.1% before the high finally wore off. By day's end the gains were trimmed to 3.1%.With the trend still pointing higher, CGC bulls remain in control. I see little reason to doubt their domination unless the stock takes out support at $41.Not surprisingly, optimists took to the options market to express their enthusiasm. Activity jumped to 176% of the average daily volume, with 118,618 total contracts traded. 64% of the trading came from call options alone.Expectations for movement were running hot into Friday's session, so the 3.1% daily gain was kind of a dud. As such, traders crushed implied volatility driving it back down to 74%. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia reported earnings that reflected a massive slowdown in their business. Revenue and earnings for the fourth-quarter fell 24% and 48%, respectively. But there is a silver lining. While the results where terrible, the market was expecting horrific. So in a world where it's all about expectations versus reality, the numbers were good enough to deliver a 1.8% gain on the day.Looking at the close-to-close move is a bit misleading, however, because NVDA initially gapped up 5.4%, so this was undoubtedly a sell the news reaction. I suggest waiting for the stock to settle before trading it.Calls won the popularity contest on Friday. Total activity swelled to 206% of the average daily volume, with 485,943 total contracts traded. 59% of the total came from the call side.Implied volatility experienced the typical post-earnings crush, falling to 41% on the day. That places it at the 34th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $4.11, or 2.6%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-19,"A still-speculative and budding marijuana trade is looking a bit less risky for Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE:CGC) on and off the price chart. But if you're looking to grow some green in your trading account with less risk, go long CGC stock using a time-tested approach with historical precedent. Let me explain.If you want the security of a blue-chip stock, there's always the Dow Jones Industrials and its constituents like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or maybe Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) to consider. And there's nothing wrong with that. But don't forget to make a bit of room in that portfolio for CGC stock -- and who knows, maybe it will be a future blue (or green?) chip in its own right.Late last week, Canopy Growth, one of the marijuana industry's undisputed market leaders and a name ripe for secular growth, released its latest quarterly results. By some numbers, CGC stock delivered larger-than-forecast losses of 38 cents CAD. But allowing for a bit of operational leeway as Canopy grows its business, by stripping out a mark-to-market debt adjustment CGC saw a very healthy, market-topping profit of 22 cents compared to Street views of a loss of 17 cents.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAdmittedly, Canopy's earnings are a mixed blend, which by more stringent and conservative measures might cause some investors to gag. I get it.  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth Still, when looking at the other lines that matter, CGC stock's top-line growth of 282% and squiggly price line on the price chart are looking worthy of a nibble for investors interested in allocating some capital into a leader in this up-and-coming industry. CGC Stock Weekly ChartCGC stock has a history of making both bullish and bearish investors ask the question, &quot;what was I smoking?&quot; Bottom line, the emerging and volatile marijuana industry is ripe for lightning-fast, technical about-face moves on the price chart -- and shares of Canopy have seen its share of such moves.Still, if history is any sort of indicator, bullish investors should put CGC stock on the radar for purchase. Currently, shares are putting together a small handle consolidation within its large corrective cup base. That's bullish in and of itself. But with the broader market in a new uptrend, Canopy's attractive growth and positioning within the industry, the relatively tight contraction looks even stronger. Additionally, as the handle pattern has also found support from the 50% and 62% retracement levels, a breakout through the pattern high of $51.81 looks even more promising for a future purchase.I'd reasonably estimate an initial upside price target is Canopy's all-time-high of $59.25 if shares can manage a breakout. From there, the sky may not be the limit, but a rally to new highs with the possibility for very large price gains out of the corrective cup does have historical precedent on its side. In the event shares break out but then begin to falter, I'd initially set a money stop below $46. That amounts to roughly 11% exposure in CGC stock.This stop-loss minimizes exposure without playing too close to the vest in a volatile stock. It also gives the chart sufficient technical wiggle room, without marrying to the position if conditions turn south.Having said that, if you are the marrying type, I'd recommend using a married put strategy, which combines a protective put with long stock as an alternative to a stop-loss in CGC stock.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-02-19,"In retrospect, Cornerstone Macro analyst Carter Worth should not have called Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock a post-earnings breakout candidate before it reported its results last Thursday. Coca-Cola stock, after rallying from its December lows, is more than a little bit in the red following its Q4 results.It's still possible that KO stock could shrug off the knee-jerk response to its disappointing 2019 outlook and embark on a breakout surge.  * 7 Financial Stocks With Accelerating Growth That's possible, but not likely. Before its Q4 results were reported, Coca-Cola stock was nearing major technical resistance, and if nothing else, Coke's Q4 numbers largely confirm that the beverage giant is fighting an uphill battle against societal trends. Specifically, KO has found it difficult to offset the public's shift away from sugary sodas with other kinds of drinks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd yet, that's not the only stumbling block for Coca-Cola stock right now. Recapping Coca-Cola's EarningsFor the quarter ending in December, Coca-Cola generated $7.06 billion of revenue and operating earnings of 43 cents per share of Coca-Cola stock, both of which were in-line with analysts' consensus expectations.The company's top line fell 6% year-over-year, but that was entirely due to its re-franchising of some of its bottling operations, a move that ultimately improved its profitability. After adjusting for the exit of some of its bottling business, currency fluctuations, and its acquisitions, its revenue rose 5% YoY, while its operating margins improved by over five percentage points.The decision to focus more on branding and sales rather than bottling appears to have been a fiscally savvy one, though only modestly so. While revenue excluding acquisitions improved 5%, overall sales as measured by volume were flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Volumes fell slightly in Latin America and North America.KO noted that rising shipping costs forced it to raise its prices, adding that the price hikes may have lowered demand for its products. Perspective on KO's ResultsCoke's lackluster Q4 results were affected by challenges that the entire soft-drink industry is facing. That is, consumers are steering clear of sugar-laden sodas.Coca-Cola has risen to the challenge, developing new diet versions of carbonated drinks like its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar line and designing new Diet Coke cans that have proven more appealing than its standard Diet Coke can.The effort has gotten some traction, with the company's sparkling beverage sales growing 2% last year. That's not enough, however, to satisfy the owners of Coca-Cola stock, partly because the company's juice and dairy lines slumped 1% YoY, while the sales of water and sports drinks grew 3% and its revenue from its coffee and tea beverages grew a modest 1% in 2018. Concerned the company may not be capable of fostering meaningful growth in the foreseeable future, investors revolted by sending Coca-Cola stock down more than 7% on Thursday.But Coca-Cola stock may have been destined to tumble no matter what.Coca-Cola stock was up an impressive 8% from its late-December low headed into Thursday morning's report, and it had climbed more than 12% over the previous year.The strength suggested to Cornerstone Macro technical analyst Carter Worth that traders were ready to buy Coca-Cola stock on the news, driving KO stock even higher in the process.Worth's call on Monday was clearly bullish. His exact words were, &quot;Simple chart, simple breakout bet, earnings coming, and I like Coke long.&quot; A breakout move following Thursday's earnings report, however, would have snapped KO stock out of a trading range and above a resistance line that's been established since 2013. Coca-Cola stock hasn't historically made big moves that last for a long time.Given the chart's historical pattern and the depth of Thursday's selloff, a pullback to the lower edge of the trading range now seems likely. After such a move, Coca-Cola stock would be just above $42 within the next few weeks. What's Ahead for Coca-Cola StockAny sustained retreat by KO stock will be caused by the beverage company's 2019 outlook.Coke is looking for revenue growth, excluding acquisitions, of approximately 4% this year, along with comparable operating income growth of 6%-7%. All told, Coke's EPS should be little changed from last year's $2.08, give or take 1%, thanks to currency headwinds. Analysts' average EPS estimate before last week's results was $2.23.Although the company's outlook fell well short of estimates and was the main cause of Thursday's decline, it's conceivable that KO is deliberately providing conservative guidance.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-20,"PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) stock rose sharply on Friday after the global beverage and snacks giant reported fourth-quarter numbers that were largely in-line with expectations, but provided full-year 2019 revenue guidance that impressed investors. Pepsi stock rose more than 3% in the wake of the results.Source: Shutterstock From a big-picture perspective, Pepsi is doing everything right. It's expanding its beverage-product portfolio to include brands and products which resonate better with today's health-conscious consumers than traditional sodas. It's also doubling down on its push into the snacking category, which includes broadening the portfolio to include more health-conscious, relevant brands. And as far as operations, everything looks good at PEP.Meanwhile, the macroeconomic backdrop is stabilizing. Pepsi stock is also cheap both on an absolute basis and relative to shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Smart Money Stocks to Buy Now Thus, this rally of PEP stock makes sense. Good results, improving sentiment, and a depressed valuation will push Pepsi stock above $120 soon. Pepsi's Strategy Is EffectiveIn Q4, PEP reported sales growth, excluding acquisitions, of 4.6% and core earnings per share growth of 17%. That wraps up a year during which its sales excluding acquisitions rose 3.7% and its core EPS rose 9%. That was the third consecutive year that its sales excluding acquisitions rose 2%-4% range and its core EPS rose 9%.What has PEP done right during those three years? It has successfully broadened its reach and portfolio. We all know that the traditional carbonated beverage market is stagnant and perhaps even declining as consumers increasingly shift towards healthier options, like enhanced waters, sparkling drinks, and teas.PEP has made this pivot, too. Specifically, it made acquisitions, headlined by its $3.2 billion acquisition of SodaStream last year, and PEP has also made its existing beverage brands more relevant and healthy.Pepsi has made a similar pivot in the snacking category. Much like traditional sodas, traditional, sugar-heavy snacks are losing popularity as consumers shift towards healthier options. Mostly through acquisitions, such as the late 2018 acquisition of plant-based-snack-bar-brand Health Warrior, Pepsi has made its snacks exceptionally relevant to today's health-conscious consumers.This strategy of acquiring relevant, popular snack and beverage brands, and distributing them around the world, is a winning combination. For the foreseeable future, the strategy will generate largely consistent, low-single-digit-percentage-revenue growth for PEP. Coupled with cost-cutting measures, that top-line growth should enable Pepsi's EPS to steadily rise by mid-to-high-single-digit-percentage levels. The Valuation of Pepsi Stock Is AttractiveThe attractive thing about PEP stock is that, because everyone piled into KO stock in 2018 and forgot about Pepsi stock, the shares of Pepsi are still undervalued even after their post-earnings pop.Consider this. KO stock almost always has a higher forward price-earnings multiple than Pepsi stock. But the divergence between the forward multiples of KO and PEP s is currently at a multi-year high. Whenever the difference between the forward P/E multiples of the two stocks is above two(which it currently is), PEP stock tends to outperform.Also, Pepsi almost always has a lower dividend yield than KO stock. But, for the first time in five years, PEP's dividend yield is almost as big as KO's dividend yield.In other words, relative to KO stock and historical standards, PEP stock seems undervalued. That is also true on an absolute basis. Assuming Pepsi's mid-to-high-single-digit-percentage EPS growth persists, Pepsi's EPS could be $8.50 by fiscal 2025. Based on Pepsi stock's average historic forward multiple of 20, that equates to a fiscal 2024 price target of $170.for PEP stock Discounted back by 7% per year (three points lower than my usual 10% discount rate to account for the yield), that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of over $120. The Bottom Line on PEP StockPEP has found a winning strategy which should power consistent, healthy revenue and profit growth over the next several years. As a result, Pepsi stock is a good name to buy when its valuation is below normal and a good name to sell when its valuation is above normal.Right now, the valuation of PEP stock is below normal, so now is still a good time to buy it.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-02-27,"Although the soft-drink giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) earned an unfortunate reputation as a boring investment, it now makes an attractive case. With multiple twists and turns in the economic and geopolitical landscape, KO stock provides a measure of stability. Conservative investors have long relied on its consistent dividends.Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)The issue, though, was that the KO stock price went range bound for several years. But in 2018, the shares finally made good on their upside potential. After hitting bottom around mid-May, the beverage-maker gained nearly 17%. Coca-Cola stock ended the year up almost 7%, becoming one of the few names that weathered last October's market fallout.Much of the enthusiasm centered on the company's rebranding efforts. As millennials and later Generation Z emerged onto the scene, their health-centric behaviors dramatically changed the beverage market. Coca-Cola stock suffered while young consumers avoided carbonated, sugary drinks. To counter this trend, the company offered its own healthy alternatives, while face-lifting and spicing-up its traditional soft-drink portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnlike earlier efforts, management finally generated momentum. Despite several fundamental headwinds -- such as unfavorable currency fluctuations and the U.S.-China trade war -- Coca-Cola generated surprising growth. Was Q4 the Growth Story's End?It was a similar story for its most recent fourth-quarter 2018 earnings report. The company met its target for earnings per share at 43 cents, while its revenue haul of $7.06 billion beat the $7.03 billion consensus estimate. This time, though, the KO stock price took a beating following the report.  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Lead the Market Wall Street didn't care for the fact that management downgraded expectations for the full year 2019. Against a forecast calling for EPS of $2.22, Coca-Cola's brass expects to &quot;range from 1% below or above $2.08.&quot;On paper, Q4 spelled the end of the growth story. Does it also spell the end of Coca-Cola stock? Soda isn't Dead and Neither is Coca-Cola StockI don't blame anyone from running away from KO stock. If you pay attention to industry news, you'll find a consistent theme: young consumers don't drink soda.Critically last year, I noted worrisome trend: both Coca-Cola and its principal rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) appeal to an older crowd. I wrote:The main challenge is shifting consumer tastes, especially among the younger demographic. Indeed, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have both unintentionally catered to a surprisingly old demographic. According to a 2016 Adweek report, Coke was most popular among people aged 35-to-44 years. The largest consumer base for Pepsi featured the plus-65 crowd.Sales stats indicate that Coca-Cola have moved the needle on demographics, especially with their slim, colorful Diet Coke packaging, That definitely helps in transitioning consumers back towards carbonated drinks.Another important point is that premonitions about soft drinks may have been premature. A year ago, Food & Wine reported that Slice soda -- a nineties phenomenon -- is making a comeback. Another blast from the past, Jolt Cola, has also returned to retail shelves.While it's too early to say whether these product resurrections will succeed, their return bodes positively for Coca-Cola stock. Logically, we can deduce that their respective backers see a viable opportunity. After all, Jolt Cola runs the tagline, &quot;All the sugar and twice the caffeine.&quot;That's enough to make millennials run to their safe spaces! Yet here they are.Moreover, I don't think prospective buyers should assume that Slice and Jolt are isolated cases. Just recently, Coca-Cola announced that an orange-vanilla variant to their flagship brand. Yes, they'll leverage their massive financial resources to market the hell out of it.But they're doing it for a reason: consumers still love soda, and that's net positive for KO stock. KO Stock is an Underappreciated China OpportunityIf the soda market's potential resurgence wasn't convincing enough, KO stock also has a viable, under-the-radar opportunity in China. Primarily, Coca-Cola can leverage its world-renown branding, something very few companies can boast.  * 9 High-Growth Stocks to Buy Now for Monster Returns Of course, branding alone won't guarantee success in China. Fast-food icon McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) has recently suffered frustrating spells in the world's second-biggest economy. Additionally, McDonald's and other American fast-food joints have found difficulty competing against local offerings.This is where Coca-Cola's much-criticized buyout of British coffee-shop chain Costa Coffee will likely benefit KO stock longer-term. Sure, management paid a hefty premium on Costa relative to what Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) earns. However, Starbucks isn't for sale.More importantly, both Starbucks and Costa compete aggressively in China. This makes sense considering that upwardly mobile Chinese millennials have embraced a coffee culture. But again, Starbucks isn't on the market. So the only way to effectively compete in the growing Chinese coffee market was through the Costa buyout; hence, the rich premium.Broadly speaking, the bears are overreacting to the immediate soundbites, which naturally hurt the Coca-Cola stock price. But if you take a step back, you'll see positive undercurrents. It just requires some patience for this narrative to play out.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-01,"Following mixed quarterly earnings reports and Wall Street spitting out and gulping down those results on the price charts, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) &quot;is it&quot; for bears and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) the stock of choice for bulls, as a well-packaged pairs trade.Source: Coca-ColaLet me explain.Earnings with their associated volatility and sometimes perverse reactions to the news can be a tough trade for investors to play. But there are times when the Street's digesting of a corporate report on the price chart goes mouth-in-hand with the results. Such appears to be the situation in KO stock and MNST stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith contrasting earnings confessionals and price feedback from Coca-Cola and Monster investors over the past couple weeks, it's time for a pairs trade in the two beverage rivals. Beverage Stock Pairs Trade Short: KO StockCoca-Cola is and has been &quot;it&quot; with famed investor Warren Buffet and his equally celebrated Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) for just more than three decades. And the returns have been staggering with gains of around 1,700% since the company initially purchased KO stock in the aftermath of 1987's market crash. But that was then and this is now.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever In mid-February, KO released its latest earnings confessional for the fourth-quarter and it was anything but sweet. Overall, the report came in modestly short of consensus estimates. That's definitely not a flavor-of-the-day combination on Wall Street. Maybe worse though, the report also offered a weak outlook and real lack of the fizz, i.e., growth, in key product markets such as plant-based and water beverages.The disappointing results left a bad taste in Wall Street's mouth with investors punishing KO stock. In the immediate aftermath, shares tumbled nearly 8.5% while gapping below its former all-time-high. But that wasn't the worst of it.  Click to EnlargeDespite the broader market's own continued bubbly price action, subsequent selling sent Coke underneath the key 200-day simple moving average used by many longer-term investors to define a stock's trend. Now and just over two week's removed from the report, with shares consolidating in bear territory just beneath the moving average, KO stock is ready to be shorted as part of our pairs trade. Beverage Stock Pairs Trade Long: MNST StockThis week, MNST stock is a strong bet with bullish investors and for good reason too. The &quot;new&quot; kid on the block delivered stronger-than-forecast double-digit growth, proving it's not your granddaddy's dusty old investment.Monster also issued a new $500 million share repurchase program. The combination pleased Wall Street as investors sent MNST stock gapping strongly and finishing higher by more than 8.50%. But it gets even better for bulls on the Monster price chart.Aside from the bubbly one-day gain in share price, MNST stock's earnings reaction also signaled a bullish breakout of a pattern mid-pivot within a corrective double-bottom base, as well as the 62% retracement level.  Click to EnlargeLooking forward, it is honestly tough to know with absolute conviction whether prior resistance will act as definitive technical support. There is that price gap, which if Wall Street folklore holds true, could always get filled despite MNST stock's solid report. But, as a purchase alongside KO stock and given price action that would still maintain the overall bullish technical integrity of the price chart, this pairs trade is one to consider seriously.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-03-08,"Your No. 1 job as an investor is to accumulate as many shares as possible of elite, dividend-paying businesses. When you realize that, you &quot;graduate&quot; into a higher class of investor.You also experience a lot less stress than the average investor.Let me explain…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFew people belong to this exclusive class because most folks are obsessed with short-term gratification.They pore over tiny market movements, news releases, CNBC clips, and other things that are meaningless in the &quot;big picture.&quot;These people are always busy trying to get the market to do something for them… instead of using the greatest power in all of investing.That power is TIME.And used properly, time causes extraordinary things to happen to your portfolio.Time allows you to earn huge yields from elite, dividend-paying businesses.Time makes it so you don't care about the moods of the stock market.Here's how it works…Let's say you buy Reliable Breweries (a fictional company), which is an elite, dividend-paying business, for $20 per share. It has increased its dividend payment every year for the past 30 years. Currently, it pays a 5% annual dividend, or $1 per share.Now, let's say that dividend grows at 10% per year for the next 10 years (this rate of dividend growth is common with elite businesses).After 10 years of growing at 10% per year, your annual dividend is now almost 13% of your initial investment. After 15 years of growing at 10%, your annual dividend is 21% of your initial investment. After 20 years of growing at 10%, your annual dividend is 34% of your initial investment.Now… do you think a guy earning a safe 13% yield with one of the world's best businesses cares about a stock-market correction?Do you think he cares about a 5% decline in home prices? Do you think he cares about some economic news story on financial television?No way.He's comfortable knowing that no matter what the stock market does, folks are still going to be buying products from Reliable Breweries.He knows the broad market could decline by 20%, and he would still get that 13% yield on his shares. They could shut the market down for a year -- and he'd still get his money.That's the peace of mind accumulators of elite, dividend-paying businesses enjoy.By combining the power of an elite, dividend-paying business and the power of time, you are able to generate massive yields on your original investment. You just have to let time work its magic.This concept is very important to understand… so let me pose a few more questions…If you're earning a 13% (and growing) yield on a stock, do you care if the share price falls 10%?Do you care if oil climbs $10 or $20 per barrel?Do you care that this guy or that guy is predicting a stock market decline?No way.No matter what stories the media is hyping, the &quot;biggies&quot; of the corporate world -- companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- will still be No. 1 in their industries.They'll still have giant, insurmountable competitive advantages.They'll still have thick profit margins.They'll still generate huge cash flows.They'll still direct a portion of those cash flows to shareholders through ever-increasing dividends.Their longtime shareholders will still earn 13%+ yields on their original investments.For most folks, trying to trade in and out of stocks takes up too much time.  It generates high fees. It produces losses. It causes sleepless nights. It drains mental energy.But if you own a collection of elite, dividend-paying businesses, you won't worry about much.You sleep well knowing that all you need is TIME.Time allows dividend growth to work its magic.Think of it like planting a money tree:Once you plant a tree, you don't have to do anything more with it. The tree sinks its roots into the ground and starts to grow. Rain, air, and the nutrients in the soil are all the tree needs. You don't have to check on it every day. You leave it alone. You let the awesome forces of nature make the tree stronger and stronger as the years go by. The tree will provide fruit, beauty and shade for you, your children, and your children's children.Buy an elite dividend-paying business at a good price, leave it alone, and it will grow large in your portfolio.Given enough time, it will throw off 5%… 10%… even 25% annual dividends on your original purchase price.It will grow into a large money tree you and your family can enjoy for decades.As you go through your investment career, keep in mind your No. 1 job: To accumulate as many shares as possible in great businesses purchased at reasonable prices.Now, earlier I used a hypothetical example -- but there are plenty of real stocks with 5%+ yields.My friend Neil George makes it his full-time job to find, assess and recommend the best of the best. With strong fundamentals and a fat yield, Neil's picks are a great foundation for your &quot;money tree.&quot;Regards,BrianCompare Brokers The post Why Owners of Elite Dividend-Paying Businesses Donat Worry About aThe Marketa appeared first on InvestorPlace.",Why Owners of Elite Dividend-Paying Businesses Don’t Worry About “The Market”

2019-03-08,"If you know nothing about the stock market except what I'll explain here today, you'll be a vastly better investor than almost everyone on Wall Street… or any MBA… or anyone on CNBC.What I'm going to share with you is a &quot;secret&quot; in the sense that few people use it. It's really an &quot;open secret.&quot; Nobody has it under lock and key. It's hiding under an invisible blanket of common sense.When you start putting this secret to work for you, you'll &quot;graduate&quot; into a higher class of investor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRight now, you've probably got some money in the stock market: You probably have a 401(k), an IRA, or an individual brokerage account.Once you've invested some money, you probably started watching a little financial television.  You probably read financial websites or a few investment magazines.While reading and listening to financial media, you're sure to encounter dozens of &quot;gurus&quot; who promote lots of different market strategies… and make lots of big predictions. You're sure to see lots of news stories about the economy and the government.It's a lot to take in. It can all be very confusing.And for 999 out of 1,000 people, it distracts them from what really leads to long-term success in stocks.You see, the news you read in the paper or hear on CNBC is completely meaningless compared to the idea I'll share with you now.Most people watch the financial news and think they're doing something important. They're actually just wasting time and getting distracted from what's truly important for making big, safe returns in the stock market.And what's truly important for growing wealth in stocks is the accumulation of elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices.That's it.It's the most important idea.It's the &quot;king&quot; of all investment ideas.It's a thousand times more important than knowing what the economy is doing… or what the government is doing… or what's happening in the news.Again… what's truly important for growing wealth in stocks is the accumulation of elite, dividend-paying businesses purchased at reasonable prices.What is an elite business?How can you find them?And how can one safely and surely generate wealth for you? The Traits of Elite BusinessesThere's no set definition of an &quot;elite business.&quot; But most smart people agree that elite businesses share some unique traits.An elite business has a durable competitive advantage over its competitors.For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has a durable competitive advantage because its huge global distribution network allows it to sell goods at unbeatably low prices. It's very, very difficult for smaller firms to compete against it.An elite business usually has an outstanding brand name. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a good example. People associate Coke's logo and name with quality soda all over the world.An elite business is often the largest business in its industry.  When you run your business better than the competition, you usually can't help but become the biggest. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) became America's biggest fast food chain because it ran a better business than its competitors.An elite business often sells &quot;basic&quot; products, like food, oil, soda, cigarettes, beer, mouthwash, razor blades and deodorant. These are things that don't go out of style.And here's something you don't often hear: Most of the truly elite businesses sell habit-forming, or even addictive, products.If you look at the list of the 50 Best Stocks of All Time (July 1926 through  December 2016), you'll note many of them sold habit-forming products. It jumps right out at you.For example, Philip Morris, rebranded a few years ago to Altria (NYSE:MO), is right near the top of the list -- creating $470.2 billion of wealth in its lifetime. It sells cigarettes, which contain addictive nicotine.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) are on the list. They sell soda… which is a sugar and caffeine delivery vehicle.People love a little sugar rush. It's habit forming… even addictive.PepsiCo's business includes Frito-Lay, and salty snacks stay strong even when sugar gets a backlash.Many big drugstore brands are on the list. These names include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) -- whose products include Ensure nutrition drinks and Similac baby formula -- Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).People get very accustomed to filling a prescription, over and over. Much of the time, those drugs are useful, although sometimes they are not. And the same goes for your favorite brand of beer. I'm not saying these things are good or bad. I'm simply pointing out that people get very accustomed to them.You can make the case that certain fast foods are addictive as well. Fast food companies load their food with fat, sugar and chemicals that make people want more. This is part of the reason McDonald's has been such a corporate success.The businesses I just mentioned produced more than 13% annual gains for over three decades.Those returns are extraordinarily rare in the stock market. You won't find anything better.An investment of $25,000 in a tax-deferred account that grows 13% per year for 30 years grows to nearly one million dollars ($977,897).Most companies can't sustain 13% annual returns for more than five years.  The businesses I just mentioned sustained those returns for decades.And the reason why they did so well is simple… Why Habit-Forming Products Are Such a Cash CowWhen people form a habit around a product, it goes a long way towards ensuring repeat business.  People get used to certain brands, and they grow resistant to switching.Also, when people get used to a product and the brand surrounding it, they are more likely to continue buying the product even if the price increases a little. Both of these help companies sustain long-term sales growth and healthy profit margins. That's good for shareholders.It's also important to know that when these companies hit upon the right recipes or the right mix of whatever it takes to make good products, they don't have to make large, ongoing investments in the business. They don't have to spend tons of money on more research and development.Once Coca-Cola hit upon Coke, it didn't have to change it. The same goes for Budweiser and Hershey (NYSE:HSY) and Tootsie Roll (NYSE:TR).When you develop a product that people love and develop habits around, you don't tinker with it. You don't have to spend a lot of money on new research and development. You don't have to buy expensive high-tech equipment. You can instead spend that money on things that will provide a high return on investment, like marketing, distribution or manufacturing.This means a larger percentage of revenues can be sent to shareholders.Owning the world's top sellers of basic (often habit-forming) products is also ideal for investing in high-growth emerging markets like China and India.Combined, China and India have about 10 times the population of the United States. Many of those people are at the level of economic development of 1940s America… and they are getting a little richer every year. It's one of the biggest investment opportunities in history.To invest in this trend, I don't want to try and guess what websites will get the most clicks… or what retailer will become popular. That's a very difficult game to play. Those business landscapes will change rapidly.On the other hand, I'm very confident those folks in China and India who are getting a little richer every year will want to enjoy the same habit-forming products Americans have enjoyed for decades.They'll want to consume more branded soda, cigarettes, beer, liquor and processed foods.Owning elite, global businesses that serve those growing markets makes a lot of sense.By the way… these global sellers of branded, habit-forming consumer goods are the kinds of businesses Warren Buffett, the greatest investor in history, always looks to buy. He's a long-time owner of soda-maker Coca-Cola and candy maker See's Candies.My friend Neil George also owns several big-name, habit-forming brands in his portfolio for Profitable Investing -- a portfolio that has a long track record of correctly timing (and profiting from) trends ranging from gold and real estate booms to income stocks.Regards,BrianP.S. Besides habit-forming products…there's another key element that the best-performing stocks share.Compare Brokers The post The 1 Way to Invest for Retirement appeared first on InvestorPlace.",The #1 Way to Invest for Retirement
2019-03-08,"When a great business develops a durable advantage over its competitors, it often begins paying steady and rising dividends.Dividends are cash payments distributed to a company's shareholders. They are often quoted in dollars per share, as in &quot;Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) pays a dividend of $1 per share.&quot;Dividends are also quoted in terms of a percent of the current stock price. This percentage is referred to as the &quot;yield.&quot; You might say, &quot;Coca-Cola pays a dividend yield of 3%.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe respected investment research firm Ned Davis Research produced a study that shows why investors should care a lot about dividends.This study contained some of the most valuable data you'll ever see.Understanding this data can make you rich. Not understanding it can cost you years of wasted effort and lots of money. I'll show you this data in a simple table.You shouldn't invest one dime in the stock market unless you understand it.In the study, Ned Davis Research analyzed the returns of various types of stocks within the benchmark S&P 500 index from 1972 to 2016.Ned Davis Research placed each S&P 500 stock into one of four general categories:* They placed companies that were reducing or eliminating their dividend payments into one category.* In another category, they placed companies that didn't pay dividends.* In another category, they placed companies that were paying dividends, but not increasing them.* In another category, they placed companies that were paying dividends and were increasing them.In other words, Ned Davis Research categorized stocks based on their policies of paying cash to shareholders.You could say two of the categories (reducing dividends or not paying dividends) consisted of businesses that were generally not good at paying cash to shareholders.You could say one category consisted of companies that were okay at paying cash to shareholders (paying dividends, but not increasing them).You could say the fourth category consisted of stocks that were great at paying ever-increasing amounts of cash to shareholders (paying dividends and raising them).According to the study, companies that paid growing dividends returned an average of 9.86% per year. Companies that were paying dividends but not increasing them returned an average of 7.33% per year. Companies that did not pay dividends returned an average of 2.46% per year. Companies that were cutting or eliminating their dividends returned -0.47% per year.Here is that data shown in a table:Source: Ned Davis ResearchThe results of the over 40-year study are clear: Companies that are great at paying cash to shareholders perform better than companies that stink at it. As the ability to pay dividends increases, returns go up. As the ability to pay dividends declines, returns go down.Continuously rising dividends are a mark of business excellence. And business excellence translates into big shareholder returns.&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; you might say. &quot;If I only buy stocks that don't pay dividends, won't I miss out on big growth stock winners that invest their profits into growing the business instead of paying it to shareholders?&quot;To this objection, I say, &quot;Yes, you will.&quot;By sticking with dividend-paying stocks, you will miss out on investing in the next Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)… or the next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).But remember, for every winner like Starbucks, there are 1,000 failed coffee chains.For every winner like Facebook, there are 1,000 failed websites.It's very, very unlikely that the average investor will be able to consistently find these companies early on… and hold them for years. Even trained professionals struggle (and often fail) to pick those kinds of winners.It's much, much more likely the average investor will be able to consistently identify companies that sell boring, basic products like soap, burgers and beer… and pay ever-increasing dividends.By now, you know those companies are usually found in your refrigerator, cupboard or medicine cabinet.If you're interested in building long-term wealth in the stock market, consider changing the way you look at different stocks.Consider placing each business you come across into one of four simple categories.And only buy businesses that fit into one of those categories: the rising dividend category.Does the business pay rising dividends, stagnant dividends, no dividends, or is it reducing dividends?If the business doesn't pay continuously rising dividends, pass on it. Here's a simple rule of thumb for you to follow.Buy the best and ignore the rest!Regards,BrianP.S. My friend Louis Navellier is all about Elite Dividend Payers.

2019-03-11,"Feeding off of Thursday's strong selling, Friday's bearishness may have been a little too zealous from the get-go. Before the closing bell rang, the bulls were back to testing the waters, whittling the day's loss down to only 0.21% for the S&P 500. The intraday rebound leaves stocks on unclear footing headed into Monday's trading.Kroger (NYSE:KR) was a key laggard. After losing 10% on Thursday after reporting disappointing fourth-quarter numbers and dishing out a lackluster full-year profit outlook, the sellers dug in again to leave of nearly 5% lower on Friday. National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ) lost even more ground, however, falling 15% in response to earnings and a downgrade from Guggenheim, but perhaps also in response to some strange comments from CEO Nick Caporella.There were a handful of winners. Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO) popped more than 11%, snapping a four-day losing streak, fueled by the potential of a new children's book series. There just weren't enough Funko's to drag the broad market out of the red.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs Monday's trading action gets going, stock charts of Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI), Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) are the names that should be on traders' radars. Here's why, and what to look for. Coca-Cola (KO)The big bearish gap Coca-Cola shares left behind last month may be aching to be filled in, but there's no particular timeframe the market has in mind when it makes a point of filling in those gaps. It happens when it happens&#92;&#92;.  * 5 Airline Stocks In Serious Trouble And, with that as the backdrop, one more bearish day could drag Coca-Cola shares under a pivotal support level that could easily incite another wave of selling.  Click to Enlarge • The support line in question is around $44.40, where KO has made a low several times since August if last year. It's plotted in blue on the daily chart.• Zooming out to the weekly chart of KO, we can see much more basis for the current retreat. Though the stock tried to buck the trend in February, the parallel support and resistance lines that prodded last year's advance and the pullback since November have been in place since 2013.• If the floor around $44.40 fails to hold up, the pattern says Coca-Cola stock could slide all the way back to the longer-term floor around $42.20. Johnson Controls (JCI)With nothing more than a quick glance, Johnson Controls looks like a decent long bet. It pushed its way back above its 200-day moving average line last month, and though last week it looked like it might fall back under it, the bulls stepped up to the plate on Thursday and Friday when most other stocks were getting thumped.When one takes a step back, however, it becomes clear that JCI shares still have a massive hurdle to clear. Crawling above it could be a huge bullish catalysts, but doing so would have to break a long-standing pattern.  Click to Enlarge • The 200-day moving average line is plotted in white on both stock charts. That line served as a ceiling late last year, but failed to hold the rally back last month.• Although they're not perfect, Johnson Controls shares have been guided lower since early 2017 by a falling set of support and resistance lines, plotted in yellow.• Ironically, the worst thing that could happen here is a decisive one-day breakout thrust that only invites profit-taking thereafter. The more sustainable advance out of the channel would be slow and calculated. Citrix Systems (CTXS)Near the middle of last month we cautioned that Citrix Systems shares were stuck in a narrowing range, but struggling to move higher even within that range. Most of its moving average lines had started to keep rally efforts in check.Nothing really changed in the meantime. Though it took some time for the grandmother of all moving averages to get full bearish traction, that finally happened last week, in spades. Though we may see a bounce effort today, some major damage has been done. One more rough day could push CTXS over the edge.  Click to Enlarge• With Friday's good-sized loss, Citrix has broken below the lower edge of a converging wedge pattern that has contained the stock since the middle of last year.• Bolstering the bearish case is repeated resistance at the white 200-day moving average line, most evident on the daily chart. After so many failed attempted to clear it, the bulls finally gave in.• The bounce from Friday's low is noteworthy, as it matched the low made in October. The bulls may have drawn a line in the sand there. If that support, plotted in green, is broken though, there's nothing else to keep shares propped up.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-11,"The stock market went ripping higher on Monday, with the bulls hoping they set the tone for a strong week to come. What do our top stock trades of the day have to say? Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 1: NvidiaWe just talked about this one last week, cautiously noting that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were trending higher but risked falling back to its range lows near $130. In that same layout we said range resistance was near $160.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Warren Buffett Stocks You Can't Go Wrong With Who would've known that Nvidia would rally north of 7% after outbidding Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) on Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX) for $6.9 billion? With the rally NVDA is up over $160, but it's not out of the woods yet. We've seen the stock stall out a few times just above this level. If we can get some continuation on Tuesday (up over $165) or just a few days of chop/drifting higher and staying over $160, it could setup for a larger rally.If Nvidia begins to rally, it's got the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the 52-week range at $188, while the gap fill up near $198. That would be a solid target if Nvidia can get some momentum. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: AppleNot all that long ago, we pointed out the very tight consolidation pattern Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was holding in. It flirted with several breakouts over the $175 to $176 level, but never really got going. Then on Friday, it gave us a false breakdown, opening below the 21-day moving average and short-term uptrend support.It closed higher on the day, but not without giving us a fright first. That's why the close is Oh. So. Important. Then we got our 3.3% rally on Monday. I would love to see this name fill the gap back up to $185 and touch its 200-day at $189, then digest. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Coca-ColaRallying almost 3% on the day, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bulls are happy to see some positive momentum. The move is thrusting KO back over the 200-day and 21-day moving average.My concern would be a strong/neutral open on Tuesday that goes south as the day wears on, as sellers line up and dump on KO into possible resistance. Over $46.50 though and I feel that KO is making a stronger bullish move. The MACD and RSI (blue circles) still have a lot of room to run if this name can gather some momentum.If resistance kicks it down, look for support down near $43.90 to $44.50. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: InvitaeInvitae (NASDAQ:NVTA) has been such a beast since we flagged its breakout near $15. After tagging $21, the company announced a secondary, which temporarily weighed on the stock. However, investors gobbled up every last share (and then some) and this name is back to hitting new highs.Nearly all of its trends (long term and short term) are from the lower left to the upper right, making this a prime buy-the-dips candidate. Look for a dip into recent uptrend support, with the 21-day trailing just behind. Keep in mind this name is overbought, but it's got strong momentum in its sails. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: BoeingBouncing hard off its lows, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock suffered a nasty gap down from news of a fatal crash over the weekend. Shares were lower by more than 11% in early trading, but the stock has erased most of those losses.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio After filling its January gap, BA promptly rallied through its 50-day moving average and $390. A close over $400 would be most ideal. Short-term bulls who bought the morning lows may consider taking profits, but at the very minimum, we want to see this one stay north of $390 and the 50-day. Below the latter and BA could revisit Monday's lows.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-03-12,"Getting paid a reliable and growing dividend is a great thing. Over time, it can produce 13%+ yields on an initial investment that started out at a 5% yield.But there's a way to make this great idea even better…Elite, dividend-paying companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) allow you to harness the most powerful investment force on the planet.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis force is called &quot;compounding.&quot;Compounding occurs when you place a chunk of money into an investment that pays you a return on your money. But instead of taking the returns and spending them, you &quot;reinvest&quot; them… and buy more of the investment.By doing this, your dividends earn more dividends and your interest earns more interest.You can think of compounding returns through dividend reinvestment like rolling a snowball down a hill. As the snowball gets larger, it's able to gather more snow… which enables it to get larger… which enables it to gather more snow… which enables it to get larger… and so on.Eventually, you build a snowball the size of a house.Compounding is the ultimate way for the &quot;little guy&quot; to safely build wealth in the stock market.Given enough time, a good compounding vehicle (like a Dividend Aristocrat) will turn tens of thousands of dollars into millions of dollars.For example, let's say you invest $10,000 in an investment that pays a 5% dividend. You intention is to compound over the long term.In Year 1, a $10,000 investment paying 5% in dividends will pay you $500. You take this money and buy $500 more of the investment.In Year 2, your investment has grown to $10,500, but still earns 5%. That year, you'll earn $525 in dividends… which you can use to buy more of the investment.In Year 3, your investment has grown to $11,025, but still earn 5%. At the end of that year, you'll earn $551.25 in dividends… which you can use to buy more of the investment.You can see how it works.After 20 years of compounding, a stake of $10,000 throwing off 5% in dividends will grow to $26,533.After 30 years, it will grow to $43,219.After 40 years, it will grow to $70,400.And remember, this number assumes no further money is added to the program as the years go by… or that the investment produces any capital gains.As you can see, long-term compounding produces extraordinary effects.It's a very important concept for young people to learn… because they have the power of TIME on their side.The longer you can compound, the more extraordinary the results.The following example shows just how extraordinary the results can be…Consider two investors, Robert and Sally.Robert opens a tax-deferred retirement account at age 26. He invests $3,000 per year in this account for 40 consecutive years. Robert stops contributing at age 65. His account grows at 9% per year.Sally opens a tax-deferred retirement account at age 18.  She invests $3,000 per year in this account for eight consecutive years. After those eight years, she makes no more contributions to her retirement account. Her account grows at 9% per year.The results of these two approaches are below… and they are extraordinary:Robert Sally Age Contribution Year-End Value Contribution Year-End Value 16 $0 $0 $0 $0 17 $0 $0 $0 $0 18 $0 $0 $3,000 $3,270 19 $0 $0 $3,000 $6,834 20 $0 $0 $3,000 $10,719 21 $0 $0 $3,000 $14,954 22 $0 $0 $3,000 $19,570 23 $0 $0 $3,000 $24,601 24 $0 $0 $3,000 $30,085 25 $0 $0 $3,000 $36,063 26 $3,000 $3,270 $0 $39,309 27 $3,000 $6,834 $0 $42,847 28 $3,000 $10,719 $0 $46,703 29 $3,000 $14,954 $0 $50,906 30 $3,000 $19,570 $0 $55,488 31 $3,000 $24,601 $0 $60,481 32 $3,000 $30,085 $0 $65,925 33 $3,000 $36,063 $0 $71,858 34 $3,000 $42,579 $0 $78,325 35 $3,000 $49,681 $0 $85,374 36 $3,000 $57,422 $0 $93,058 37 $3,000 $65,860 $0 $101,433 38 $3,000 $75,058 $0 $110,562 39 $3,000 $85,083 $0 $120,513 40 $3,000 $96,010 $0 $131,359 41 $3,000 $107,921 $0 $143,182 42 $3,000 $120,904 $0 $156,068 43 $3,000 $135,055 $0 $170,114 44 $3,000 $150,480 $0 $185,424 45 $3,000 $167,294 $0 $202,112 46 $3,000 $185,620 $0 $220,303 47 $3,000 $205,596 $0 $240,130 48 $3,000 $227,369 $0 $261,742 49 $3,000 $251,103 $0 $285,298 50 $3,000 $276,972 $0 $310,975 51 $3,000 $305,169 $0 $338,963 52 $3,000 $335,905 $0 $369,470 53 $3,000 $369,406 $0 $402,722 54 $3,000 $405,923 $0 $438,967 55 $3,000 $445,726 $0 $478,474 56 $3,000 $489,111 $0 $521,536 57 $3,000 $536,401 $0 $568,475 58 $3,000 $587,947 $0 $619,637 59 $3,000 $644,132 $0 $675,405 60 $3,000 $705,374 $0 $736,191 61 $3,000 $772,128 $0 $802,448 62 $3,000 $844,889 $0 $874,669 63 $3,000 $924,199 $0 $953,389 64 $3,000 $1,010,647 $0 $1,039,194 65 $3,000 $1,104,876 $0 $1,132,721 Less Total Invested -$120,000 -$24,000 Net Earnings: $984,876 $1,108,721 Return on Money: 8-fold 46-foldSally made just eight contributions of $3,000, for a total of $24,000 invested. Robert made 40 contributions of $3,000, for a total of $120,000 invested.However, Sally started at 18 years of age and Robert started at 26 years of age. Sally started eight years earlier. And those eight extra years of compounding are worth more than all of Robert's 32 years of extra contributions.Despite a much smaller total contribution, Sally ended up with more money… and a much, much bigger return on her investment.This example shows why compounding is such a powerful idea to teach children. They have the ultimate advantage of TIME.This piece of knowledge is one of the greatest financial gifts you could ever give your children.In order to put your compounding plans on autopilot, consider using something called a &quot;dividend reinvestment plan,&quot; also called a DRIP.A dividend reinvestment plan is just what it sounds like. It's a plan that takes the dividends you earn and reinvests them into buying more stock.Once you set up a DRIP, you don't have to do a thing. Again, think of a DRIP as a way to put your compounding plan on autopilot.You can ask any stock broker to institute a DRIP for you. Any reputable online broker will do it for you. It's a simple process. You can find directions on your broker's website or call the customer service department.Regards,BrianCompare Brokers The post How Elite Businesses Allow You to Contribute Less and Make MORE appeared first on InvestorPlace.",How Elite Businesses Allow You to Contribute Less and Make MORE

2019-03-13,"From the looks of it, National Beverage Corp. (NYSE:FIZZ) is a brand in crisis mode. The parent company of leading sparkling water brand La Croix has seen its growth narrative come off the rails over the past several quarters as competition in the sparkling water category has heated up and broader market growth has cooled for FIZZ stock.Source: H. Michael Karshis (Modified)Meanwhile, management appears to be in damage control mode, the PR backlash hasn't been great, and the outlook for demand and profit growth to return in the near term is bleak.All together, FIZZ stock has dropped from a 52 week high of $120-plus six months ago, to prices below $60 today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAt this point in time, the bear thesis on FIZZ stock looks pretty compelling. You have a brand that is rapidly losing mind and market share in a slowing market, with falling margins and rising opex rates, too. All together, National Beverage Corp. will likely pivot into an era of sideways profits for the foreseeable future, which should lead to further weakness in FIZZ stock.  * 15 Stocks Sitting on Huge Piles of Cash That thesis sounds good. But, it misses one big element: valuation.At current levels, FIZZ stock is dirt cheap. It's already priced for all those negatives. But, in the event that National Beverage Corp. actually turns sales around and stabilizes margins, this stock could fly higher.I think that's what will happen. In the big picture, National Beverage Corp. is losing share in a rapidly growing market that has supported and will continue to support multiple high volume brands. La Croix will be one of those high volume brands. As such, sales will stabilize. So will margins. And profits.None of that stabilization is priced in today. That's why now looks like the right time to buy the dip in FIZZ. The Brand Is Losing SteamThere's no question about it; La Croix is losing momentum. Revenues rose 18% last year. Then, throughout the course of fiscal 2019, they have fallen from 18% to 13%, to 7%, and finally to down 3% last quarter. As revenue growth has slowed, gross margins have come under pressure, as have opex rates. All together, profit growth has pivoted from hugely positive, to hugely negative.There's a few reasons behind this big pivot. First, the sparkling water category is slowing. There's nothing that National Beverage Corp. can do about this. Sparkling water market growth rates have steadily declined over the past several years, as is only natural for a red hot market with big growth rates.Second, competition in the sparkling water category has picked up. There's also nothing that National Beverage Corp. can do about this. More competitors have entered this market, include PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) with their flavored sparkling water drink Bubly. Those new competitors have stolen share from La Croix.Thus, largely due to no fault of its own, La Croix brand is losing momentum. The financial implications of this are meaningful. Revenue growth will be way slower going forward thanks to falling market share. Gross margins will be pressured for the foreseeable future due to bigger pricing competition. Opex rates will head higher as the company will have to spend more to compete on the awareness front.Putting all that together, it's easy to see that National Beverage Corp's profit growth over the next several years won't be great. After back-to-back years of 30%-plus profit growth, investors weren't expecting great. As such, FIZZ has come under significant selling pressure over the past several quarters as weak profit growth has turned into a reality. The Valuation Is Cheap Enough to BuyWith sales slowing, margins retreating, and profits shrinking, it's tough to see why you would want to buy FIZZ here. But, the bull thesis is pretty simple. All those negatives are already priced in. Eventually, they will fade out. When they do, the stock will pop in a big way.The reality is that, while La Croix is losing market share to newer entrants in the sparkling water category, this brand still remains one of, if not the, most important brand in the sparkling water market.It's easy to see La Croix's dominance weakening going forward. But, it's equally tough to see the brand not being one of the top sparkling water drinks in any time horizon, given that La Croix has become almost synonymous with sparkling water.As such, La Croix should be able to grow revenues at a slightly slower rate than the entire sparkling water category. The entire sparkling water category projects as a double-digit grower over the next several years. Thus, La Croix should be able to grow revenues at a high single digit rate during that stretch.Gross margins will come under pressure, but should stabilize as competitive forces stabilize. Opex rates will likewise move higher, but should retreat in the long run thanks to high single digit revenue growth and stabilized competition.Overall, I think sparkling water market expansion can drive National Beverage's EPS towards $5 by fiscal 2025, even against a competitive backdrop. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi normally trade around 20 forward earnings. Based on that comp average 20 forward multiple, a realistic fiscal 2024 price target for FIZZ stock is $100. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fiscal 2019 price target of over $60.FIZZ  trades at under $60 today. Thus, it's reasonable to say that, even considering all the competitive risks, FIZZ stock is undervalued relative to its long term growth prospects. Bottom Line on FIZZ StockI used to drink a lot of La Croix. Now, I drink some La Croix and some Bubly. Apparently, I'm not the only one who has started drinking Bubly, and FIZZ stock has dropped big as a result.But, I still drink La Croix, as do a ton of consumers, and the whole sparkling water category is still growing by a ton. Thus, growth in the long run will stabilize and remain healthy. FIZZ stock currently isn't priced for this. That's why buying the dip here looks like an opportunity.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FIZZ.

2019-03-14,"Amateur investors often bring up a common objection to buying elite dividend-paying businesses. Acting on this objection often leads them into very risky investments.Most elite dividend payers sport annual dividend yields in the neighborhood of 2%-5%. And these yields are incredibly safe and reliable. They rise every year.In addition to elite dividend payers, the stock market contains groups of businesses that pay annual yields of 6%… 8%… 10%… even 12%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe amateur looks at these numbers at says, &quot;Why buy a business that yields 4% when I can buy one that yields 8%?&quot; And then, the amateur makes one of the biggest investment mistakes in the world.They &quot;chase&quot; yield.There's a classic piece of investment wisdom about chasing yield. It goes: &quot;More money has been lost chasing yield than at the barrel of a gun.&quot;    Chasing yield is the act of buying stocks simply because they offer high yields… while ignoring vital business factors.Some businesses engage in risky business ventures or take on lots of debt in order to pay high yields. Finance and real estate companies often do this.Some businesses own oil & gas wells and pay dividends from the production. Those dividend payouts are often totally dependent on oil & gas prices staying elevated. They can be incredibly volatile.These businesses are usually very dangerous for the average investor.For example, there is a group of companies whose chief business activity is borrowing money at low interest rates… and then using that borrowed money to buy mortgages that pay higher interest rates. They make money from the &quot;spread&quot; between the two.One of the largest and most popular of these companies is Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY).Annaly is probably operated by good people. But because it borrows lots of money to buy mortgages, its business -- and its dividend yield -- is very volatile. Small changes in the business (like how much it has to pay to borrow money) can cause enormous changes in shareholder returns.Below is a chart of Annaly's dividend payments from early 1998 to early 2019. As you can see, these payments are incredibly volatile.The volatile nature of Annaly's dividend payment leads to volatile share price movement. Below is a chart of Annaly's share price during the same time period (early 1998 to early 2019).The volatility in the early 2000's and around the 2008 financial crisis is par for the course, given what was going on in the market.But even after the recovery in 2009 -- note the drop from $19 per share to $10 per share.Or… consider the performance of the San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE:SJT). Prior to 2014, this trust was one of the biggest most popular trusts that owned natural gas assets.Then, the price of natural gas dropped around 65%. Because the San Juan Basin Royalty Trust derived its revenue from natural gas, its shares dropped as well. As you can see from the chart below, they fell from $20 to around $4 per share.Also consider the performance of Enerplus Resources (NYSE:ERF). Years ago, it was one of the biggest and most popular firms that owned oil & gas wells… and paid dividends out of production.Starting in 2014, crude oil fell from over $100 per barrel to less than $30 per barrel. This decline helped crush Enerplus shares. As you can see, they fell from $25 per share to barely $2 per share.The examples of Annaly, San Juan Basin, and Enerplus are not unique. And I'm not picking on these particular businesses.This story plays out over and over in the stock market… with dozens and dozens of companies.Unsuspecting investors see a company offering a very high yield and they buy it. They don't do any research to determine if the business model is risky or not. In almost every case, it is.Some investors are good at timing their purchases of these volatile businesses. They buy them when they are deeply out of favor with most investors.However, the average investor almost always buys these businesses at the wrong time: near share price peaks. He picks up 8% in dividends and then losses 30% on the share price drop.The individual investor is much, much better off owning stable businesses that pay out reliable and growing dividends. You don't trade in and out of elite-dividend payers. There's no frequent buying and selling. There's no worry that the share price will fall 30%. There's no dangerous leverage.You simply buy them and begin building wealth the low-stress way.While the dividends and share price of Annaly were bouncing up and down, elite dividend payers like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) were paying steady and rising dividends.And that's easy to spot…if you have a powerful, yet elegant tool at your disposal -- like my friend Louis Navellier's Dividend Grader.Once you've found a solid dividend, without a ton of price volatility…the rest is history.Regards,BrianP.S.

2019-03-15,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has become a favorite among investors. How could it not, given its consistency, continued growth and dividend increases? Yet, as good as PEP stock is, not everyone is sold on the beverage and snacks maker. Who's not on board? Credit Suisse analysts.Last week, the research team initiated coverage on the Pepsi stock with an underperform rating and $100 price target on shares. The stock didn't really feel the impact of that downgrade -- given the strength of the overall market lately -- but as it stands, the target implies just under 14% downside from yesterday's $115.50 close.Is that something investors really need to look out for and if so, should they consider Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) instead? KO stock sits midway between its 52-week low and high.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Evaluating PepsiCoWorth pointing out (or maybe not) is that Credit Suisse has the lowest price target on the Street. The average target is at $117.75, not much higher than current levels, while the highest sits up at $133, implying just over 14% upside.The analyst is critical over PEP stock's valuation, which is admittedly a bit high. The stock trades at more than 21 times this year's earnings. That wouldn't be all that bad for a blue-chip stock, but the growth profile is disappointing. Analysts expect the company to earn $5.51 per share this year, which is a 2.7% decline from 2018. That's despite 2.5% sales growth this year.Over the last five years, PEP stock has an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.9. If that were the case now, that would put Pepsi stock down near $109.  * 7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5% Perhaps investors are excited about the company's prospect of growing earnings and sales 7.8% and 3.9% in fiscal 2020, respectively, but that's a long ways off. Some further digging shows Pepsi stock has other strains.While gross margins are ticking higher in the recent quarter, they have been trending lower for over two years on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating margins have come under pressure over the past few quarters, while free cash flow has been greatly pressured. In 2016, the company generated more than $8 billion in free cash flow, while in 2018 it barely eclipsed $6 billion. Trading Pepsi Stock  Click to EnlargeIs PEP stock a bad company to own? Absolutely not. After the company's 15.2% dividend bump last May, the stock pays out a respectable 3.2% yield. For long-term investors, this potential decline isn't likely enough of a reason to sell the stock. But perhaps it will cause them to wait for a decline before buying more.I don't know if we get Pepsi down to $100 without a market-wide correction. That said, its valuation is stretched at a time when growth isn't exactly robust. As for the PEP stock price, take a look at the three-year weekly chart above. Support and resistance are quite clear, while uptrend support (in blue) makes its way higher.  * 7 Top Stocks to Buy From Goldman Sachs' Secret Portfolio The Doritos maker is a good company, so I'd be interested on a pullback into support, (although we won't likely get it at $96 like we did last time). Because the Pepsi stock valuation is stretched, it makes me hesitant to buy -- even on a move over resistance, given this isn't the type of quick-moving momentum stock that investors typically trade. KO Stock or PEP Stock?So that brings up the question, should investors buy PEP stock or KO stock?To much surprise, KO stock might be the better buy, at least right now. Coca-Cola stock trades at almost 22 times this year's earnings, which is only slightly higher than Pepsi. However, analysts expect earnings to grow 1% this year on the back of 9.3% sales growth. In 2020, forecast call for a similar outlook to Pepsi, which is for 7.6% earnings growth and 4.4% sales growth.Coke has superior growth in 2019 and similar growth in 2020, while maintaining similar free cash flow profiles and superior margins to PEP. Also worth mentioning is KO stock's dividend yield, which stands at 3.5%.That said, KO stock doesn't have a screaming-low valuation and its earnings growth is somewhat disappointing given the more than 9% sales growth this year. The chart looks decent though.  Click to EnlargeSupport at $43.50 to $44 continues to hold, while KO stock is above the 200-day level and is now coiling just beneath $46. We got lucky with our sell call at $50 and now may be a time to add back to that position a bit.The conclusion? Neither KO stock or PEP stock jumps out as a massively better pick than the other. Over the next 12 months though, Coca-Cola stock seems to have the edge.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

It's still illegal to smoke in Georgia, but that doesn't mean the illegal market isn't operating …But what about the legal market?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsStock in Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), the Canadian pot company, now sits finely poised between earnings due on today after the bell and a shortage of stock to short.Tilray stock is expected to lose 12 cents per share on revenue of $14.15 million. (Earnings Whispers puts the numbers for earnings and revenue at -15 cents and $17.69mm, respectively.) But that may be less important to speculators than Tilray's efforts to create credibility with the marijuana and general investor communities.  * 7 Small-Cap Stocks That Make the Grade Consider the following: Tilray has appointed Andrew Pucher, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), as chief corporate development officer.Pucher joins a team that now includes former executives from Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), Diageo (NYSE:DEO), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Further, Tilray has a partnership with Novartis (NYSE:NVS), a joint venture with Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) and a production agreement with the privately-held Authentic Brands Group.Finally, Tilray last week announced a deal to buy Manitoba Harvest from Compass Group (NYSE:CODI) for about $315 million.With all this corporate star power and deal-making, you would think Tilray would be a major pot producer. What About the Product?What product?Tilray sold no marijuana during the first two weeks after Canada legalized it in October. CEO Brendan Kennedy insisted that this will have changed by this quarter, while simultaneously announcing he bought producer Natura Naturals for $26.3 million. If all this is leaving you skeptical about the company, you're not alone …Tilray short interest recently stood at 4 million shares, 24.62% of the company's float, and there's no more available to borrow. That's why shares of a company that may report revenue of $17 million trade at a market capitalization of almost $7 billion.The other is that most of the shares don't trade, with over 78% held by &quot;individual stakeholders.&quot;  There are 79 million shares outstanding. The Marijuana MarketSpeculators are betting that over the next few years, many more U.S. states will legalize marijuana sales and are looking to legislators for guidance.New Jersey is the latest with a bill to allow recreational sales. Meanwhile, Massachusetts is getting a network of pot shops, debate has begun in Connecticut and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is pushing the issue.But despite the examples of Colorado and Washington, the path to legal pot is still not a straight line.Minnesota Republicans recently rejected a legalization effort, prospects are dimming in New Mexico and New York's move is being held up by black legislators who want specific provisions for their communities to benefit.As a result, most moves lately have been toward legalizing medical marijuana, with doctors' prescriptions and extensive regulation. Florida is moving in that direction. So is Oklahoma.All that said, marijuana remains an illegal drug under U.S. law.People are still being put in jail for marijuana offenses and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk may lose his SpaceX security clearance after being shown on video smoking pot on a podcast. Bottom Line on Tilray StockDespite the success of Colorado, where marijuana sales are now growing at only single-digit rates in the fifth year of legalization, the product remains controversial.Tilray and its competitors are preparing for an opportunity that may not come to them for years. Meanwhile, marijuana stocks have been bid well beyond fundamentals. A lot of people are cashing big paychecks, and the dream of a well-regulated American pot market remains hazy.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-03-21,"Cannabis stocks are climbing this year and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) is among the leaders of that pack. Shares of ACB stock have nearly doubled year-to-date and are in the midst of a breathtaking March rally of more than 33%.Source: Shutterstock Returns like those, particularly in the short time frames, might give investors reasonable pause about Aurora Cannabis stock, or any other stock for that matter. Indeed, the risk/reward proposition on ACB stock looks a lot different today than it did at the start or 2019. In terms of upside potential, Aurora Cannabis stock would need to rally another 28% to reclaim its 52-week high.That is not an impossible climb for ACB stock, but the near- to medium-term issue is finding upside catalysts because plenty of good news is already baked into this marijuana stock. For example, ACB surged earlier this month on news activist investor Nelson Peltz is joining the company as an advisor. That sent ACB stock to a double-digit intraday gain and the shares are up more than 11% since then.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Analysts Say About ACB StockSell-side analysts are not correct about any stock 100% of the time. Investors that acknowledge that can help mitigate disappointments. That said, some analysts are bullish on ACB stock.  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter Earlier this month, Cowen's Vivien Azer -- one of the most respected analysts tracking marijuana equities -- initiated coverage of Aurora Cannabis with an Outperform rating and a price target that works out to the equivalent of about $10.50 in U.S. dollars.&quot;While establishing 20% market share has been an early success story in Canadian adult use cannabis, the company is uniquely positioned to drive leadership in both share and profitability,&quot; Azer wrote in a note, according to Barron's.The analyst &quot;believes that Aurora will deliver positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by its fiscal fourth quarter in June, making it one of the first of its peers to reach this milestone,&quot; reports Barron's.Some analysts also view valuations on ACB stock as favorable relative to other marijuana names. Consider this about the valuations assigned to some weed equities: Aurora Cannabis stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of 101 and a price-to-book ratio of 3, according to Morningstar data, and that's considered a value relative to its peer group. Peltz PowerAs was noted above, news of the activist investor Peltz getting involved with Aurora Cannabis is priced into the shares, but that does not diminish the importance of this news going forward. One of the biggest drags on Aurora Cannabis stock has been the company's inability to form partnerships with more mainstream companies as some of its rivals have.Think Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) taking a multi-billion stake in Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) or Altria (NYSE:MO) forming a partnership with Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON). Last year, it was rumored that Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO), the world's largest soft drink company, held talks with Aurora to develop cannabidiol-infused beverages, but a deal did not materialize.Peltz has long tradition of working with management teams -- particularly at large consumer staples companies -- to streamline operations and bolster efficiencies to enhance profitability.Aurora Chairman Michael Singer mentioned the beverage, cosmetics, health and wellness and pharmaceutical industries as potential growth areas for his companies and Peltz could help the upstart cannabis company make inroads into those arenas.  * 5 Stocks To Buy for the Happiest Employees  The Bottom Line on ACB StockAurora Cannabis definitely shows promise in the marijuana space, and Nelson Peltz only adds to the pot stocks' legitimacy. For now, however, all of the good news looks priced into ACB stock -- even if a valuation of 100x forward earnings is a steal in the cannabis area.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-21,"I'll be honest: I simply don't understand the bull case for Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The KO stock price has held up reasonably well in recent years, admittedly. But Coca-Cola stock isn't cheap. There are obvious risks to demand going forward. Add on disappointing growth, and the numbers here don't seem to add up.Source: Coca-ColaI concede that I've long been a skeptic toward KO stock. I called it &quot;expensive&quot; 20 months ago at roughly the same price, and it's at least held up. On this site, Luke Lango made a &quot;buy the dip&quot; case last month; a few days later, Josh Enomoto highlighted the company's opportunity in China.With all due respect, I disagree. The issue from here is that many investors are valuing Coca-Cola for what it was: a wonderful business that produced steady growth and lockstep increases in its dividend. Coca-Cola stock famously has made billions of dollars for Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). It's also been a great long-term investment for the rest of us.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks on the Rise Heading Into the Second Quarter But times change. And those changes have notably shifted the investment case here. The KO Stock Price Tumbles After EarningsAt this point, it seems increasingly difficult to make the fundamental case for Coca-Cola stock. A multi-year transformation -- including a &quot;refranchising&quot; of its bottling operations -- has hit revenue in recent years, but it was supposed to create a leaner, more profitable company.That's a key reason why the KO stock price fell over 8% after disappointing earnings last month -- a huge move for a typically low-volatility stock. Guidance for 2019 was much weaker than expected. Coca-Cola expects earnings growth of -1% to 1% against 2018's $2.08.Investors were hoping for much more after the refranchising. The problem goes beyond results for a single year, however, as 2019 guidance implies EPS of $2.06 to $2.10. In 2013, Coca-Cola's non-GAAP EPS was $2.08. Over six years, including a massive transformation, earnings per share will barely move, if at all.But even that doesn't tell the full story.Coca-Cola stock, like so many other U.S.-based investments, has benefited from a lower tax rate. The underlying (i.e., adjusted) tax rate in 2013 was 23%. It's estimated to be 19.5% in 2019. That lower rate provides a 4.5% benefit to net earnings. Billions of dollars in share buybacks boost EPS as well. Considering this, Coca-Cola has 4.5% fewer shares outstanding than it did in 2013. In other words, KO is making less pre-tax profit than it did six years ago (the figure has declined about 8.7% by my math).And yet, Coca-Cola stock trades for 22x the midpoint of 2019 EPS guidance. That multiple seems incompatible with the performance over the past few years. The Risks to KO StockTo be fair, a stronger dollar has been an issue, hitting revenues and profits overseas. Coca-Cola is projecting a significant currency headwind, with 6% to 7% impact on operating income in 2019 alone. This comes after a 4% hit in 2018. Essentially, much of the potential benefit of the refranchising has been swallowed by currency effects.That said, it's not as if the dollar is guaranteed to get weaker going forward. KO stock still looks reasonably expensive against even currency-neutral growth. Meanwhile, risks are rising.Soda consumption continues to decline in the U.S., dropping by 20%-plus over two decades according to one report. Coca-Cola has tried to diversify, acquiring Costa Coffee and sparkling water manufacturer Topo Chico last year. But a $5 billion coffee deal -- let alone a $220 million bottled water purchase -- doesn't move the needle much against a $200 billion market cap.The trend here is consistently negative, particularly in terms of diet soda. Sparkling waters from Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), National Beverage (NASDAQ:FIZZ) (even with some recent trouble), and private companies like Polar and Spindrift are taking share from diet soda. Neither Coke with its Dasani brand, nor Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) with its Aquafina, have been able to win much in that market. New BrandsMeanwhile, HSBC Securities highlighted an interesting stumbling block for Coca-Cola's plans for expansion. Coca-Cola has looked to new extensions, including flavored Diet Coke and an orange-vanilla offering for its full-calorie brand. But, as HSBC pointed out, those efforts are likely to upset the same bottlers who have taken over Coke's operations.Smaller products have high startup costs, as well as long payback periods. Coke's refranchising may slow it from following the brand expansion strategy that's currently popular among consumer companies. It's a bit analogous to the risk facing Coke customers McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR). Those companies have shifted costs to their franchisees too. However, those franchisees may rebel as their parents look to compete solely on price or otherwise push the limits of their profitability. Not Enough GrowthFrom here, zero growth isn't worth the risks facing the industry. As such, KO stock looks far too expensive. I asked last year if Coca-Cola might be the next giant to stumble after consumer heavyweights Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD), Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), and Altria (NYSE:MO) saw big declines.It hasn't happened yet, even with the post-Q4 selloff. But I wouldn't be shocked if it did. In fact, I'd be less surprised if KO stock fell sharply than if Coca-Cola somehow figured out how to grow in an industry destined for long-term declines.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

We last recommended a covered call on KO at the end of December. We made a profit off that trade, and once our KO January 18th $48.50 Covered Call expired worthless, we held KO common stock until mid-February. Then, we took profits on our KO common stock position shortly before the stock dropped on Valentine's Day in the aftermath of the company's disappointing earnings announcement.Now that the stock has finally stabilized at support and is starting to bounce higher, we're jumping back into a position on KO.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Fundamentally SoundKO is an iconic beverage company. We've said that many times before. It owns brands like Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Minute Maid, Dasani, Vitaminwater, and the stock has a strong dividend yield of 3.52%, which makes it an attractive buy in the current market.Last week's pullback on the S&P 500 likely caused some portfolio managers to start moving a portion of their portfolios into defensive stocks that have growth potential. KO is one such stock.We know this because it was one of the few stocks that is moving higher on a day when the broad majority of S&P 500 components were moving lower. We anticipate investors' move into this stock should keep it above $45.

2019-03-28,"McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shows early signs of readying for another breakout. Trading close to its 52-week high of $190.88, the food retailer agreed to acquire an Israeli digital startup for around $300 million. This buy should further advance the company's already-solid implementation of simple store-level technology solutions. With MCD stock valued at 21 times forward earnings, investors may look for McDonald's to accelerate its revenue growth.Source: Shutterstock For a rumored $300 million, McDonald's is getting personalization and decision-logic technology developed by Dynamic Yield. That tech will enable the fast-food purveyor to more closely match its offerings to what its consumers want. Through an outdoor digital drive-through, customers get a more-immersive, personalized experience from McDonald's menu items. And by combining the trending food items of the day, time of day, current weather, and current restaurant traffic, the technology will help guide the customer through the decision-making process.Things have certainly come a long way from &quot;would you like fries with that?&quot;.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Hybrid Brick-and-MortarMcDonald's is leveraging its brick-and-mortar retail fronts with the latest technology. What better way to compete with online-only restaurants and other firms that use apps and online channels to take orders ahead of time?  * 7 Reasons to Buy Housing Stocks in 2019 McDonald's will also integrate this technology into its own mobile app, self-order kiosks, and other digital consumer experience touchpoints.Ahead of the acquisition news, Cowen had noted that the restaurant chain's renovations will drive continued revenue growth. With strong earnings and sales on the way, the brokerage views MCD stock as a solid defensive play that is also appealing to fixed-income investors. Though the dividend yield of 2.5% is not high, it's still better than that offered by Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Still, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) offer dividends north of 3%. Pepsi is especially attractive because its P/E is 13.8 times, compared to 24 times with MCD stock. Growth OpportunitiesMCD's 24x P/E is low when investors consider the company's growth prospects. Restaurant additions, along with the optimization through renovations and promotions, will ensure steady revenue growth. In 2017 and 2018, the stock traded in a range because McDonald's had only started driving higher traffic growth at its locations. This year, integrating the Dynamic Yield technology and offering UberEATS at most, if not all, of its locations, will fuel higher sales.  * 7 Beaten-Up Stocks to Buy as They Reverse Course The beauty of UberEATS is that it increases consumer awareness for the McDonald's brand. And once the customer makes that first order, getting repeat business is easier than winning initial business from those customers. MCD Stock ValuationTraffic into fast-food restaurants is on the decline, so McDonald's must differentiate itself from competitors. As more people work from home, the population ages, and habits for eating at fast-food chains change, McDonald's must continue to adapt. The technology changes will most certainly add meaningfully to the bottom line. Offering delivery and changing the customer experience for the better will also offset the macro headwinds McDonald's faces.Analyst sentiment engine Tipranks.com shows that of the 11 analysts covering the stock, eight have a buy rating and three others have a hold. The average price target is 6% above the recent share price of around $187. Using finbox.io to model a fair value for MCD stock with a 5Y DCF growth exit model, assume revenue falls for the next two fiscal years. In this scenario, macro headwinds are hurting all fast-food chains. If revenue recovers in year 5, then McDonald's stock is trading close to fair value. In this downside scenario, MCD has a fair value that is around 5% below the current share price.Buying MCD stock today is low risk. The company continues to put its customers at the forefront of growing the business. And few firms ever fail to grow when enhancing the customer experience to drive repeat sales higher. That is the case for McDonald's stock.As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-29,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips When it comes to digital search giant Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG everyone thinks digital advertising After all of the company s 140 billion in net revenue last year 85 of it was from Google advertising,Insights Could Be the Next Big Thing for Alphabet Stock
2019-03-29,"When it comes to digital search giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), everyone thinks digital advertising. After all, of the company's $140 billion in net revenue last year, 85% of it was from Google advertising. As such, it is reasonable to assume that as goes the digital advertising business, so goes GOOG stock.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business Source: Shutterstock But digital advertising is just one way to monetize what is Alphabet's most valuable asset: data. The other way to monetize data is through insights, and this market represents a huge growth opportunity for Alphabet over the next several years. Broadly speaking, digital advertising involves leveraging user data to create targeted ad campaigns so as to increase brand awareness. This market is huge, but growth is broadly slowing. Meanwhile, insights involves leveraging user data to generate actionable insights for brands to optimize other enterprise decisions outside of advertising, such as product creation, placement and branding. This market is currently small, but could one day be as large as (if not larger than) the digital advertising market.Hence, when looking at GOOG stock, I no longer think digital advertising. I think insights. Specifically, I think about how much upside GOOG stock has if the company successfully pivots into the insights market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Insights Is a Huge OpportunityDigital advertising is a huge market. Globally, digital advertising revenues will total around $330 billion this year, up 17% year over year. But growth in this market is slowing, mostly because digital ad spend now represents nearly 50% of total ad spend globally. Consequently, over the next several years, digital ad growth rates are expected to slow, and drop to below 10% by 2022.That's bad news for GOOG stock. As mentioned earlier, Alphabet is roughly 85% digital advertising. Thus, as the digital advertising space slows, Alphabet's growth trajectory will flatten out too, right?Maybe not. Data is very valuable and important. Digital advertising is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes monetizing that data. Specifically, digital advertising is data applied to just one enterprise function (advertising). What about all the other enterprise functions? Can data be used to help a company create a better product? Can it be used to help a company optimize its supply chain? Or increase brand equity through better branding decisions?Yes, yes and yes. If Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has data which shows that flavored carbonated waters are trendy, then they will probably develop new flavored carbonated water beverages. Meanwhile, if Nike (NYSE:NKE) has data which shows that consumers prefer shopping at Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) over Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS), then they will probably allocate more product to Foot Locker. Further, if Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has data that Ariana Grande is super popular among its core demographic, then the company will probably launch a signature drink with Ariana Grande (it already has).All of these actions fall under the broad umbrella of data-driven enterprise decision-making. Data-driven enterprise decision-making is the future. One day, all enterprise decisions will be made using a data-driven approach. Importantly, data-driven decision-making is the byproduct of data turned into actionable insights.As such, I think the global insights market projects as one of the biggest growth markets over the next several years. Today, it's relatively small. Tomorrow, it will likely be far bigger than the $300 billion-plus global digital ad industry. Alphabet Is Best Positioned to Dominate Insights (for Now)At the current moment, the company best positioned to dominate this insights market is Alphabet.Alphabet has the most robust and in-depth consumer data set in the world. They know what consumers are searching for on the internet. They know what links consumers are clicking and interacting with. Beyond that, thanks to YouTube, they know what videos consumers are watching online, and which ones they are liking. Thanks to new product expansions like Google Flights and Hotels, they also know where consumers are traveling -- and when.In short, Alphabet knows a lot. All that knowledge can easily be transferred into actionable insights for enterprises of all shapes and sizes.Indeed, it already is. Over the past year, Alphabet has built out a product called News Consumer Insights. Broadly speaking, News Consumer Insights takes raw data from Google Analytics, and turns it into useful business intelligence and actionable insights for publishers. This includes telling publishers what stories are trending, which ones are gaining traction, which ones are falling off, so on and so forth, so as to enable publishers to increase readership and engagement.News Consumer Insights is a subset of what could one day be a far, far larger global insights market. Right now, Alphabet is positioned as the potential future leader of this market given its data advantages, and that means the uptrend in GOOG stock is far from over. Bottom Line on GOOG StockAlphabet's digital advertising business is slowing. Ostensibly, that's a big deal for GOOG stock. But, if the company successfully pivots into the insights market, then the slowdown from digital advertising will hardly be noticed by investors.  * The 7 Best Bond Funds to Buy for a Shift in Interest Rates Instead, insights growth will more than offset digital advertising's slowdown, and GOOG stock will remain on a winning path.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long GOOG, NKE, FL, and DKS.

2019-03-29,"During the first quarter of 2019, Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) stock price has lagged many other stocks. Year-to-date, despite the impressive market rally in the broader market, Coca-Cola stock is down 1.5%.Source: Coca-ColaIn comparison, the return on S&P 500 with the dividends reinvested would be almost 13%. Although its stock has not rewarded shareholders so far this year, I believe that the Coca-Cola belongs to a well-diversified portfolio.Here is why:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Coca Cola and MillennialsCoca-Cola is the world's largest beverage company with 20 different brands that generate more than $31 billion dollars in annual revenues. Over the decades, many investors have regarded it as a reliable investment.For example, Coca-Cola stock tops the list of longtime favorite holdings of Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) owns 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola, worth over $18 billion. In the last quarter of 2018 when many stocks suffered sizable losses, KO was the only green stock among the top 10 holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Transformed Their Business However, most of this decade, KO has seen declining revenues, partly because of the drop in soda sales as the U.S. consumer has moved towards healthier beverages including flavored water.Therefore, management has been transitioning the company to offer a beverage portfolio that seizes on the public's increased appetite for flavored drinks, including colas. For example, in 2016, the company announced its &quot;One Brand Strategy&quot; and introduced a common visual identity and creative campaign for all the brands.Later in 2017, it relaunched Coke Zero. This year, it introduced a U.S. wide ad campaign for its new flavor, Orange Vanilla Coke to coincide with March Madness. As a result of the changes in the product offerings, now cherry and vanilla flavored Cokes account for about 9% of the dollar volume but bring in 18% of the dollar growth.Earlier this year, the group completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee in the U.K. Wall Street believes that the purchase of the biggest coffee chain in the U.K. could lead to increased diversification away from soda drinks as well as revenues, especially prompted by growth in the Chinese market, where Costa Coffee currently has almost 500 stores.Offering hot beverages for the first time is yet another strategic step for the group as it addresses the shift in consumer taste and purchasing behavior.As you are deciding what may be next for KO stock fundamentally, you may also want to think about whether the global economy or the U.S. may be headed for a slowdown or even a recession.During periods of market volatility or economic downturn, consumer staples tend to be among the last products that consumers remove from their household budgets. In other words, defensive stocks like KO may help your portfolio when the going gets tough in the markets.On the flip side of the coin, despite the recent decline in the stock price, Coca-Cola shares still seem expensive when compared to the five year trading history. In mid-March, the stock also was downgraded from $64 to $50.  Therefore, some analysts urge investors to consider KO stock's peers, such as PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP).Nonetheless, over the past decade, the returns of both stocks would have been very similar; in fact KO investors would have been slightly better off than PEP shareholders. Reinvesting the KO Stock DividendIncome investors know that they can compound their returns through reinvesting dividends from high-yielding shares. Despite the question marks regarding future growth at Coca-Cola, its dividends make the shares rather attractive. In February, the company increased its dividend and declared a new share buyback program.The current dividend yield stands at 3.5% - another reason why I believe KO stock belongs to a capital-growth portfolio. The next dividend payment is scheduled for Apr. 1, 2019 to shareholders of record on Mar. 15. KO Stock in the Short TermFollowing the sell-off on Feb. 14, Coca-Cola stock has been range trading between $44.5 and $46.5. This band is likely to act as a strong support zone for the stock where it can form a base to make a new sustained leg up.Those investors who pay attention to moving averages and oscillators should note that the short-term technical message is giving &quot;neutral-to-buy&quot; readings.I would not advocate bottom-picking in case of near-term price weakness. Yet, I find KO stock to be a compelling buy candidate and I'd regard any potential dip in the price as an opportunity to grab the shares for the long term. Within a year, I'd expect the shares to trade slightly over $50.If you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may also consider using a covered call strategy with approximately a three-month time horizon. In that case, you may, for example, buy 100 shares of Coca-Cola at a limit price of $46.61 (the closing price on Mar. 27) and, at the same time, sell a KO June 21 2019 $47 call option, which currently trades at $1.15.The $47 option is slightly out-of-the-money, offering some downside protection in case of volatility and a decline in KO stock. This call option would stop trading on Jun. 21, 2019 and expire on Jun. 22. The Bottom Line on Coca-Cola StockAfter considering the pros and the cons for the stock, if you are also of the opinion that the management will be able to strengthen the story of Coca-Cola, the iconic beverage company, and its balance sheet and that the stock is ready for a rebound on either technical and fundamental grounds, you may want to add KO shares to your portfolio in the second quarter of 2019.In 3-4 years, patient value and dividend growth investors are likely to be rewarded handsomely.In case you do not want to own Coca-Cola stock by itself, but would rather invest on a sectoral basis, you may also consider an exchange traded fund (ETF) that holds KO,  such as the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP) or the Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSEARCA:PBJ). Or you could even consider investing in Coca-Cola indirectly by owning shares of Berkshire Hathaway.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-02,"Speculating on buyouts can be dicey. Just look at the situation with Nielsen Holdings (NYSE:NLSN), which is a leading global measurement and data analytics company. Last week a report from the New York Post sent the company's stock reeling by about 10%. The result is that most of the gains for the year for Nielsen stock were wiped out.Source: David Boyle via FlickrThe news report indicated that the company's efforts to sell itself have hit a wall that is, it appears that Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) has backed away from the deal. It also looks like Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) has been losing interest as well.So what now? Is this a sign to stay away from Nielsen stock? Or might there be value here? Well, it is not unusual for buyers to get cold feet. In auction situations, the valuations can get excessive. In fact, both BX and APO are known to be quite disciplined with their dealmaking.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The Elite 8 Stocks to Buy for Massive Outperformance But then again, when it comes to Nielsen stock, the valuation is really not a problem. Consider that the shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 12.6X. The dividend yield is also at an attractive 5.26%.Now there are certainly some other positives.  For example, Nielsen has a strong platform that goes well beyond TV ratings, such as providing measurement services for websites and apps. These are must-have offerings as brands need a way to evaluate their large marketing budgets. Nielsen is also highly trusted, as the company has been around for more than 90 years.By having access to large amounts of data, Nielsen is in a position to leverage artificial intelligence. This technology should allow for providing predictions and insights, which should lead to more effective ad campaigns. The Problems with NLSN StockYet there still are some nagging issues. Note that last year the top-line flat-lined and there was a drop in operating cash flows from $1.3B to $1.06 billion. It looks as if this poor performance is a key reason for BX's reluctance.Why the slowdown? One problem is that NLSN's customers are pushing back on price increases. Let's face it, some of its major ones, such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), Unilever (NYSE:UN) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), are under pressure to rethink their marketing budgets.Then there is the issue of online privacy. For the most part, new regulations in Europe have made it more difficult to measure audiences.Oh, and something else: The company has initiated a restructuring. This has not only included a focus on reducing costs but also simplifying the operations. Because of a string of acquisitions, the IT platform is a jumble of legacy systems, which has made it difficult to leverage next-generation technologies.We need to make faster, bolder decisions. We're going to need to execute those decisions and we need to transform Nielsen into a truly product-driven measurement and technology organization,&quot; said Nielsen CEO, David Kenny, on the latest earnings call. Bottom Line On Nielsen StockAgain, Nielsen stock is trading at reasonable levels. The dividend should also act as a cushion. And even though the cash flows are flagging, there should be enough to fund the dividend for a while.Nevertheless, NLSN stock may still languish. The restructuring is still in the early stages and the marketing industry is undergoing major changes. It also is not encouraging that top-tier private equity firms appear to not have much interest. After all, they have access to large amounts of proprietary information about the company.So given all this, it's probably best to avoid NLSN stock for now.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-04-04,"Over the years of watching Wall Street, I learned that we tend to trade &quot;memes.&quot; In 2017, the meme was bitcoin. In 2019, the meme is the cannabis trade. Today, I share my reasons why Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) stock is still the marijuana stock to bet on for those who want to be in on the pot trade long-term.Source: Shutterstock Investors are flocking to cannabis like moths to light; and like bitcoin, marijuana also extends to Main Street. Who among us doesn't have a friend or two who have &quot;invested&quot; in pot stocks, or a cannabis venture of sorts, legally, of course?  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises Jumping in on any trade early when the concept is still a rising hot star is easy because all boats float. We all remember how popular Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) was in September as it hit $300 per share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's all a dusty mess and it's hard to sift through it to uncover the potential gems. Now that some time has elapsed and the peaks in the stocks have eased, it has become easier to identify which companies will lead the way.It is almost never the case that the companies who started the movement get to thrive in the end. The cannabis industry, although it's as popular as bacon, is still unproven as a public business concept. So from an investment perspective it's a more of a bet than a fundamental thesis. Don't hate me for saying this, because this is not the same as me denying its potential. The Best Marijuana StocksWithin that context, CGC has the best odds of winning since it has the fattest balance sheet, thanks to the $4 billion cash infusion it received from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). So, CGC will have the best tools to bring to fruition whatever potential the cannabis industry has.The process of incoming investments from companies like STZ -- and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) into Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) -- is an important part of the thesis. This helps investors uncover potential winners. This way we get to leverage their due-diligence and research. In this case, I can rest assured that STZ did a lot of homework before they sank a big pile of cash into CGC.Investing in the pot stocks is insane from the traditional sense. They have massive valuations. Marijuana stocks' market capitalization is in the range of 300 to 1. This won't be a value-based investment. To justify buying Canopy Growth stock, we'd have to look way past this or look to next year's results. Bottom Line on Cannabis StocksThere will need to be a huge explosion in the marijuana legalization trend, big inroads in the drinkable products, and a bigger scope of adoption by the medical community. All of this to happen quickly is a tall order. But the consensus is that the pursuit is worth it since there will be a giant pot of gold … pun intended.For the short-term, CGC stock is technically trading in a tight range. Those usually end in a breakout from that zone but the direction is unknown. However, CGC has recently defended its February lows, and it did so above a recent cluster of support from the December drubbing.This favors the odds of a bounce to breach $49 per share. That would bring in momentum buyers to $55. But there will be resistance along the way, at levels such as $45 then $47.In summary, the marijuana stock trade at this stage is mostly a general concept. The bullish thesis on cannabis is very broad, so it's easy to embrace and difficult to short. This also contributes to levitate investor enthusiasms. Nevertheless, this is a viable long-term thesis and Canopy Growth stock would be my pick of the proverbial litter.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-04,"Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) reported earnings this morning and initially Wall Street liked what they saw. STZ stock spiked on the headlines but has faded. So now the job for the bulls today is to hold the line so they can build further upside on a strong report.Source: Shutterstock Management's scorecard shows that they easily beat estimates fueled by strong Corona and Modelo beers. The wine sales, on the other hand, were weak but management has already acted to remedy this shortfall.Maybe it was a sign that they expected drama over the wine weakness this morning, but they broke some pertinent news. Just after the market closed on Wednesday, we learned that Constellation Brands is looking to divest 30 of their lower-priced wine and spirits brands to Gallo for about $1.7 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough this was less than what there were seeking for it, this should ease investor concerns about the sales miss this quarter. And this will put a nice pile of cash back onto their balance sheet.  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises Coming into the report STZ is up 12% year-to-date, just trailing the S&P 500. So there is some room to give back here but the stock ranges are tight. STZ stock has just finally recovered from their last earnings debacle so they can't afford another letdown here.It's not that they delivered a stinker of a report. Net sales did fall relative to last year, but they did beat the analyst estimates. What's important is that they improved their bottom line as net income per share sprang almost 40% from a year ago. So clearly management is executing on plans very well.However, and as is the case in every dip on earnings these days, management committed the cardinal sin of earnings events. They guided lower for the coming quarter. Investors have no tolerance for that these days and that's almost all that matters to them for the short term.We often see perfect quarters trigger big selloffs if the guidance is weak. But STZ management is not worried they are merely being cautious in a time when we have so many geopolitical worries still looming. If they were truly worried they wouldn't raise dividends or continue buybacks. They simply want to under promise and over deliver.This is a proven management team and they are not afraid to take risks. They were first of the mega-cap companies to invest in the cannabis pot of gold. They dumped $4 billion into Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and risk this size is proof that they can commit to potential when they see it.Fundamentally, Constellation Brand stock is cheap. It sells at a price-to-earnings ratio of 13x, which is twice as cheap as Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) or Coke (NYSE:KO). So owning its shares here is not a giant financial risk.We all know that 2018 ended badly for stocks. Christmas marked the bottom for the most of them and since then we've recovered almost all of it. However, STZ did not bottom until Jan. 9. The good news is that since, STZ stock clawed its way up 20% from the abyss. Along the way, the $175 per share zone was important.Just the same, the zone above this morning's pop is also important. It is a prior pivot point that dates back two years. So these are resistance on the way back up. So the Constellation stock bulls have work to do. Breaking through $188 area will not be easy but if management can continue to deliver strong results it will be doable.The weekly chart shows that the STZ stock breaching $177 per share started a rally that has more upside in it so they are on their way. The close today will be important to maintain this momentum. There is nothing to sustain concerns in today's report so it's not likely that there will be big sellers here.There is support below but it needs to hold. Losing the $160 per share zone create a major technical problem for the bulls. While this is not a forecast and definitely not my expectation, it is a realistic scenario that does exist.  * 5 Low-Priced Tech Stocks With Great Potential The experts on Wall Street agree because most analysts who cover the stock rate it as a buy. So for those who own the shares for the long-term need not worry about any short term stock gyrations since management is doing its job well.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-09,"Looking back at 2018, we thought that was a big year for marijuana stocks…as voters approved marijuana (to varying degrees) in four more U.S. states -- Oklahoma, Michigan, Missouri and even Utah -- not to mention Canada.But 2019 will be a HUGE year.On the path to widespread legalization -- and huge gains for us as investors -- even more &quot;dominos&quot; are about to fall. Seven of them, in fact.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Catalyst 1: The STATES ActThe first step toward ending federal prohibition could happen this month…as soon as Congress votes on the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act.Essentially, the STATES Act would formally entrust marijuana laws to the states. As long as residents follow their state's laws, the federal government would not be able to intervene.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Momentum is building -- it's a bipartisan bill that's picking up cosponsors left and right. The Chair of the House Rules Committee is confident that it will come to the House floor &quot;within the next several weeks.&quot;The STATES Act removes two big hurdles:* Right now, few banks are lending to marijuana companies. The federal &quot;red tape&quot; is just too prohibitive. But once the Feds are no longer interfering…those floodgates will open.In fact, a separate bill is already on its way to the House floor -- the SAFE Banking Act -- that does just that.* Investors will soon have many more options for investing in the marijuana megatrend -- as more companies will be able to make the &quot;Jump&quot; I'll be covering in a special event tonight. Please click here to RSVP to my Cannabis Stock Summit…then tune in at 7 p.m. ET to hear all about it. Catalyst 2: 2020 ElectionsRight now, we have 12 governors in office who ran on pro-marijuana platforms.And 2020 will be the first presidential race with a focus on candidates' views of marijuana and legalization.With two-thirds of adults in the country in favor of legalization, it is becoming more politically damaging not to support it. An eye-opening 75% of Democrats support legalization, and odds are that every candidate from that party will side with the majority of their voters. Even more astounding is that for the first time, over half (53%) of Republicans now back the legalization of marijuana. Catalyst 3: President TrumpI do not get into my personal political views when it comes to my commentary and investing. My goal here is to help you make money. It doesn't matter what political party is in control.Marijuana is a bipartisan issue…in what could be a very close presidential election. President Trump has said he will &quot;probably end up supporting&quot; the STATES Act. I wouldn't be surprised to see President Trump push medical-marijuana legalization nationwide, as long as it could be the deciding factor behind a Republican win.That's great news for Pot &quot;Jumper&quot; Stocks…and for investors who stand to turn a small stake in them into a windfall. You'll be well-positioned to do just that after tonight -- when I share my 1 pick to buy now. Catalyst 4: Marijuana Declassified as Schedule 1 DrugIt's only a matter of time before the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) moves marijuana down from a Schedule 1 drug (like heroin, LSD and ecstasy) to a Schedule 5 drug (like Robitussin, which we can buy anywhere).Marijuana's removal from Schedule 1 will clearly be a major boost to the industry, and I'd expect to see many more pot stocks make the &quot;Jump.&quot;What's more, it will also allow for more medical testing of marijuana at universities and research centers, which will lead to even more positive medicinal breakthroughs. Catalyst 5: GlobalizationAt a cannabis conference I attended in January, several CEOs referenced overseas opportunities - from more legalization in the European Union to cheap grow facilities in South America to opportunities in Africa and Australia.The odds of a European country legalizing recreational marijuana in 2019 are above 50/50. Whichever country is first will set itself up for big profits. Marijuana tourism is booming, and it is very easy to country hop for residents in Europe. Catalyst 6: BrandingThink about any consumer good and you immediately think of the most popular brands. Soft drinks - Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Fast food - McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). Athletic wear - Nike (NYSE:NKE). Coffee - Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). And so on.As more products hit the shelves and the marijuana industry starts to mature, there is no doubt that a few brands will rise to the top. Right now, every company that produces consumer cannabis products is angling to top that list. And a key step is attracting more investment dollars by making the &quot;Jump&quot; I'll be discussing in tonight's event. Catalyst 7: Hemp and CBDThe medical and legal establishments are coming around to hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) oil…the non-psychoactive &quot;cousin&quot; of marijuana that won't get you high.CBD has been used by wellness and medical professionals for years as an alternative treatment for everything from anxiety and depression to chronic pain to the reduction of inflammation to childhood epilepsy. CBD is now considered one of the most beneficial compounds available to humans, and it does not have the nasty side effects that many drugs do.Producing hemp CBD wasn't easy -- until now.The 2018 U.S. Farm Bill removed hemp from the DEA's Schedule 1 drug list for the first time since the 1930s. So, you can expect hemp-derived CBD products to hit the shelves in Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Whole Foods, and every other major store. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) have already announced that they will start selling topical CBD.Notice how these catalysts are all driven by the increasing number of states and nations that are legalizing marijuana. Any time governments open up a huge new market like legal marijuana, investors can win very big. We're already seeing that, and there is a lot more to come -- as more and more pot stocks make the &quot;Jump.&quot;I'm hard at work today, wrapping up my presentation with everything you need to know about Pot Jumper Stocks…Be sure to tune in tonight at 7 p.m. ET, when I'll clue you in to this phenomenon -- and even give away my next stock pick, for free.Matthew McCall is the founder and president of Penn Financial Group, an investment advisory firm, as well as the editor of Investment Opportunities and Early Stage Investor.

We also have a Keurig coffee machine, and I'm enjoying a pod coffee as I write this … but that doesn't mean I'm going to buy KDP stock.Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Since it was formed at the end of July, KDP stock has outperformed its larger rivals, Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). But its results still lackluster, and a downgrade from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), which sees the single-serve coffee fad fizzling, recently sent it down by 4%.Even at that price, it's no bargain. The company's dividend of 15 cents gives it a yield of 2.19%. In a slow-growth area like beverages, you buy stocks for dividends, not growth. Despite the caffeine jolt of the Keurig merger, this remains at heart a third-rate soda company.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The BackgroundKDP was formed last year when JAB Holdings, which had taken Keurig Green Mountain private in 2015 for $13.9 billion, used it and cash to buy publicly traded Dr Pepper Snapple Group. DPS stock holders got a special dividend of $103.75 per share.  * 7 Marijuana Companies: Which Pot Stocks Should You Buy? The resulting company is the 4th largest U.S.-based beverage company, behind Pepsi, Coke and Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), the beer and wine outfit. It's the 10th largest beverage company in the world, less than half as large as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and Nestle S.A. (OTCMKTS:NSRGY), the leaders in coffee.About one-fifth of the revenue comes from distributing other drinks, through a group called Allied Brands. After the merger, Allied lost one of its biggest sellers, Fiji Water, which decided to build its own distribution network, and bought Big Red, another Texas soda, for $200 million.It was the distribution network that attracted the German Riemann family to the company. It controls a host of coffee and restaurant brands through its JAB Holding and holds 87% of  Keurig Dr Pepper. Where's the Growth?The stock got out of the gates quickly and outperformed its larger rivals until it got hit with the double-whammy this year. First came its 2018 earnings report, delivered at the end of February, and then came the Morgan Stanley downgrade.The numbers weren't bad. They just weren't great. Earnings for the quarter were  $266 million, 19 cents per share, on revenue of $2.81 billion.  Wall Street turned thumbs-down on the numbers, the stock falling to as low as $25 per share.A report last month that it was working with Anheuser-Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) on an electric cocktail machine, which sounds like the Keurig Kold machine discontinued in 2016, lifted the shares until the Morgan Stanley analysis sent them back down. After the smoke has cleared, you have the third-leading sugary soda company which, while it has a solid distribution network, is still inferior as a stock to its leading rivals. Instead of paying 50 times earnings for a company with $7.4 billion in revenue, and a paltry dividend, investors might pay just 14 times earnings for Pepsi with its 3% yield or 31 times earnings for Coke and its yield of 3.44%. The Bottom Line on KDP StockKDP stock was always a bet on growth, and its growth prospects from here are not outstanding.If Keurig really has topped out, you've got a bunch of sugary sodas and a distribution network that trails rivals and likely always will. I enjoy a cup of coffee and a sugary drink as much as the next man, but as for buying the space, look elsewhere.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-04-15,"Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) can be a hostile battleground stock for bullish and bearish investors alike. Now, following a period of 'bad for your health' criticism and bad-mouthing of shares, MNST stock is setting up to find its energetic mojo on the price chart once more. Let me explain.Monster stock has not been 'it' with bullish investors of late. In the face of a terrific late-February earnings report, complete with a new $500 million share repurchase program and bubbly post-earnings bids from Wall Street, MNST nevertheless abruptly lost its fizz falling by nearly 17% to its recent corrective worst.Behind the bitterness, a couple analyst downgrades and legitimate fears of growing competition from workout-focused energy drink beverages like Bang have certainly lent a hand. More recently, beverage heavyweight Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) announced it's entering this growing specialty market despite its 16% interest and distribution partnership with Monster.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Biometric Stocks to Watch as AI Rises To say the least, the news has been a drag on Monster stock. But bulls in this notorious battleground stock are showing signs MNST stock could be setting up once again for a period where investors find themselves guzzling shares and enjoying bubbly price behavior on the Monster chart. MNST Stock Weekly Price ChartLooking at the weekly chart of MNST stock, I'll be the first to admit the bubbly post-earnings bid looked good for continued momentum. Shares broke cleanly above pattern resistance from a double-bottom base and there was little reason to believe a challenge of the prior highs weren't near.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off I was wrong, of course. I also wasn't interested in learning the hard way if Monster's bullish gap would become a victim of Wall Street folklore and all gaps get filled.Now, following the unwanted gap confirmation, I am a buyer of MNST stock if shares can rally back above $55.12 without breaking the current pivot low of $52.23. This entry represents a second attempt for Monster Beverage stock bulls to purchase shares 25 cents above the high of last week's bottoming candlestick.This purchase is backed by Monster shares closing in on an oversold stochastics position and price action having found support from the 76% retracement level and 200-week simple moving average. In our technical view, that's enough evidence to consider a long position, along with what's likely been a frustrating initial signal for other bulls and making the second entry likely a less-crowded affair. MNST Stock Daily Price Chart  Bottom-line: Should this entry signal through $55.12 in the coming days, this MNST stock position 'isn't it!' or the be-all and end-all. As the daily chart emphasizes, on top of respecting the mentioned Fibonacci and moving average-based bottom currently in place, there's also another one of those storied gaps -- and potential price confirmation we'd rather not stick around for, i.e., making us &quot;long-and-wrong&quot;.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-04-16,"In the months after Ramon Laguarta stepped into longtime PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) CEO Indra Nooyi's shoes, the market has rallied behind him. In the past three months, Pepsico stock has risen over 12%, compared to high single digits for the major indices.Source: Shutterstock Not even the move toward healthier products and away from Pepsi's core products of soda, sweetened beverages and chips has hindered Pepsico stock's ascent toward 52-week highs. On top of this, the company has increased its dividend, which sits at 3%. If performance continues to exceed expectations, it's not unlikely that another increase is on the horizon.It may be unexpected for a large food and beverage conglomerate to be generating such high returns, but under both Nooyi and Laguarta, Pepsico remains committed to its shareholders. Its diversified portfolio of world-renowned brands -- including Frito-Lay, Tropicana, Gatorade and Quaker -- continue to provide an attractive steady growth story.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pepsico Stock Has a Positive OutlookThere has been a lot of momentum coming off a strong a strong fourth-quarter and end to 2018. Laguarta intends to capitalize on PEP's organic growth trend and guided to 4% organic revenue growth in 2019. While EPS might take a slight hit due to investments in the business and an increase in its effective tax rate, 2019 should be viewed as a year of transition as Laguarta leaves his mark on Pepsico.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Frito-Lay in North America has been the biggest driver of growth and is Pepsico's largest sector by profit. It's a consistent revenue generator and has &quot;industry-leading margins and returns on invested capital.&quot;The market expects this business line to capture new demand, in especially in premium snacking. Brands like Simply, SunChips, Smartfood and Off the Eaten Path, will be in focus, so it is important that investors track the category's performance in the upcoming quarters to make sure that Pepsico is continuing to compete effectively across the entire snacking category. Pepsico Delivers on DividendsIn most of their key markets, PEP is the No. 1 or No. 2 overall food and beverage supplier. They have been very successful in marketing their products at a local level and adjusting marketing messages based on the market. Earnings should confirm that this dominance continues.They have rewarded shareholders with their success as well. On the dividend front, Pepsico stock has not disappointed. The company delivered compounded dividend growth of 9% over the last six years, returning $45 billion to shareholders.Over that same time period, organic revenue growth has averaged 3.8% and core operating margins have expanded by 1.6%. Laguarta expects to continue that growth by investing in its broad portfolio, and 2020 should be an even stronger year with high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth. Pepsico Stock ValuationThe one drawback on Pepsico stock is its valuation. Trading near 52-week highs and at a 14x P/E and 2.7x sales, Pepsico doesn't look cheap. However compared to The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), which trades at 30x P/E and 6.3x sales, Pepsico stock doesn't look expensive either.For a leader in the international food and beverage sector that has a history of raising dividends, this could be a steady return generator if the company continues to meet guidance targets on growth and earnings. Otherwise, I could see a single-digit pullback on disappointing earnings.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-18,"For most people today, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a brand and a significant piece of Americana. Many even consider it their prime choice among beverage-makers. However, what it isn't -- unfortunately -- is a viable investment. I'm sad to say this, but KO stock is incredibly frustrating.Source: Coca-Cola  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Historically, Coca-Cola stock just exists to pay out its fairly generous 3.4% dividend yield. Certainly, though, this is not the platform to get rich on. Over the past five years, KO shares have gained less than 15%. With a performance like that, this legacy firm isn't going to endear itself to the younger crowd.Even more maddening, KO stock performed admirably late last year. This was in the face of a broader market meltdown that gutted several relevant names. Finally, it appeared that management was making substantive progress toward its re-branding efforts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, the numbers told a different tale. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 slumped badly against the year-ago level. KO stock is currently on the recovery path after Q4's devastating numbers. The question, of course, is whether you should trust this rally?If any investment suffers from this-time-it's-different syndrome, it's KO stock. However, risk-tolerant buyers may want to check out these three underappreciated tailwinds: KO Stock Can Rule a Still-Popular Soda MarketYou've heard it a million times: soda is a dying beverage category. Moreover, as younger people eschew sugary drinks for healthier alternatives, that leaves little room for KO stock and rivals like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Seemingly, the Q4 figures add weight to this bearish argument.If that wasn't bad enough, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi cater to an older demographic. According to a 2016 Adweek report, Coke was the favored beverage among those aged 35 to 44 years. And for Pepsi? Try the retirement community -- those aged 65 years and up.But on the flipside, several soda brands are making a comeback, including Slice soda and Jolt Cola. As I mentioned earlier this year, this product revival is too young to make an accurate assessment of its success. However, if demand didn't exist, investors wouldn't risk their money on such a speculative venture.Moreover, more recent data indicates that American consumers still love carbonated drinks. KO's management team is looking to advantage this trend with their premium Smartwater brand. This might turn out to be a great move for Coca-Cola stock. With Smartwater, the company can apply the desired carbonation with the equally-desired &quot;healthy&quot; tag. Millennials Are the Healthy Generation? Think Again!As we just discussed, a major impediment to Coca-Cola stock is the millennial generation. Several sources refer to this demographic as the healthier generation: they smoke less, they exercise more and they make better nutritional choices.But what if I told you that this was all BS? Well, it is. And don't take my word for it; instead, listen to the Pentagon.According to the Department of Defense, more than 70% of Americans aged 17 to 24 are ineligible for military service. Why? The two most-cited reasons are health and inadequate physical fitness. As a result of this dearth of qualified recruits, some military branches are lowering standards for enlistment!So what's causing this disconnect between perception and reality? I genuinely believe that millennials think they're making healthier choices; hence, their flawed answers to survey questions. But expanding waist sizes and pools of unqualified military recruits tell the real tale: millennials are actually the least healthy generation.That's a big plus for Coca-Cola stock because it's not the product that's the impediment, but the marketing. Change the marketing -- which the company is already doing -- and KO will eventually score the coveted millennial demo. Coca-Cola Isn't Just About SodaWhile KO stock has frustrated investors to no end, I hope that my contrarian arguments provide some food for thought. The soda market, as ugly as it might look now, isn't quite so terrible when you drill into the details.But despite the brand name, Coca-Cola stock isn't just about soda. The company offers the full spectrum of beverages, ranging from premium water to natural juices to the sugary concoctions.I've mentioned this before, but one segment to watch closely is Coca-Cola's acquisition of Costa Coffee. While analysts have criticized KO for paying a hefty premium for Costa, the buyout provides a viable channel into China. Taking a chunk of Chinese market share will do wonders for overall growth.On the surface, that's not easy considering giant rivals like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) are already operating in the region. However, don't dismiss Coca-Cola so easily. Through its Japan-based Georgia Coffee brand, KO has substantial experience delivering successful results in the Asian market.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever Let me emphasize that KO stock will likely require patience.

2019-04-22,"Earlier this month, 37 already-strained Chinese organizations became even more difficult for U.S. companies to do business with. U.S. tech company Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), in fact, has suspended trade with these organizations until further notice. While Applied Materials stock hasn't been hurt yet, the fallout from the decision may not yet be fully appreciated.Source: Shutterstock On April 10, the U.S. Commerce Department updated its so-called 'red flag' list of organizations that are &quot;unverified&quot; entities. Although unverified entities aren't forbidden trade partners, they require additional licensing. They also require caution before buying from, or selling to, to avoid running afoul of strict trade rules.&quot;Even though it's not an embargo, because of the hassle sometimes suppliers will treat it as an embargo,&quot; said Kevin Wolf, former assistant secretary of commerce for export administration. &quot;It has a practical effect that's greater than the legal effect.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTo that end, it remains to be seen if the maneuver is part of a bigger tactic to bring China to the trade negotiation table, or a security concern that was going to take shape anyway. While the list includes organizations based in United Arab Emirates, Malaysia and Indonesia, China's 37 additions were far more than any other nation.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Regardless of the intent, the updated list puts more pressure on China's struggling economy, as well as U.S. suppliers and customers. Fallout and Applied Materials StockWhile the fallout from the additions to the Commerce Department's red flag list is still being weighed, whatever the broader implications it still is significant for Applied Materials. More than one-fourth of last quarter's revenue came from China alone. While not all of its Chinese partners have been affected, its remaining partners may also rely on trade with names that now require new permissions from U.S. regulators.San'an Optoelectronics, China's biggest supplier of LED chips, was one of the noteworthy names currently off-limits to Applied Materials. Other customers include Xian Jiaotong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Applied Materials' response appears decisive too. According to reports from Nikkei Asian Review, the company instructed its employees to &quot;immediately stop all pending and future equipment delivery. It also asked its employees to withdraw from sites where red-flagged entities operate. Trade War Faints and Applied Materials StockChina's regulatory governors responded to the additional names of unverified entities, with trade ministry spokesman Gao Feng calling the behavior &quot;wrong,&quot; and calling for the U.S. to undo its action.The rhetoric between the two countries is nothing new, however.As promised during his campaign, President Donald Trump has been tough on China's trade policies with the United States. In June of last year, steep tariffs were placed on roughly $50 billion worth of goods imported from China into the United States, sparking a war of new tit-for-tat tariffs.Though they were intended to bolster demand for U.S. goods corporations ranging from carmaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to food giant Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) have all claimed to be victims of the political standoff.By its specificity, the updated list of unverified companies is a step in a new direction though. It could be interpreted as an effort to quell unauthorized use of American-developed and U.S.-patented technologies.Applied Materials, along with Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Taiwan's Nanya jointly filed official complaints in late 2017, alleging China was the ultimate buyer of illegally-acquired semiconductor technologies. The Bottom Line on Applied Materials StockThe news thus far may only have boosted Applied Materials stock. AMAT shares are up 4%, swept higher with the broad market tide Other factors perhaps include the impression that its intellectual property is being better protected, or that it will remain highly competitive going forward even if it struggles with its new restrictions.By and large though, the impact of the Department of Commerce's new red flag list remains unclear. Applied Materials has not indicated to what extent, if any, it is seeking licenses to deal with the entities newly placed in the red-flag list.If China acquiesces rather than doubles down on the trade front, Applied Materials should wind up more competitively positioned even if it has to find new suppliers and customers.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-22,"Every year, the market produces a few head-scratchers. So far in 2019, one of those candidates is beverage-maker Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP). Since the beginning of January, Pepsi stock has taken a commanding lead, gaining over 17%. But is such a move sustainable given its key industry?Source: Shutterstock Known throughout the world as a fierce rival to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), both companies specialize in sugary, carbonated beverages. Here's the problem: sugary, carbonated beverages don't resonate with millennials. Moreover, Pepsi attracts the plus-65 crowd, which doesn't provide much confidence for future growth prospects of Pepsi stock.At the same time, results speak louder than forecasts or perceptions. In this case, PEP answered critics with a strong beat for the first quarter of 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAgainst a consensus earnings-per-share target of 92 cents, PEP delivered an EPS of 97 cents. This also beat out the year-ago level earnings by one penny. On the revenue front, the beverage-maker rang up $12.88 billion, beating the $12.7 billion consensus estimate. As a result, Pepsi jumped nearly 4%.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees No doubt, this was a great showing, especially for a company whose industry has a credibility problem. But is this bullishness in Pepsi stock justified? Although the sector appears ugly, the finer details tell a different tale. Pepsi Enjoys a Viable MarketplaceOne of the most commonly-cited criticisms against a rising Pepsi stock price is the consumption behaviors of millennials. According to multiple sources, young Americans are making better dietary and health choices and avoiding harmful ones.And that's true to an extent. For instance, smoking trends in the U.S. have fallen off a cliff. Plus, we're seeing beverage-makers adjust to current trends, shifting toward healthier alternatives and shelving the sugary stuff.However, outward appearances are not what they seem. After all, if young Americans were truly making substantively healthy decisions, our armed forces wouldn't have problems recruiting them. Unfortunately, the Defense Department has been forced to lower their standards in part because millennials are out of shape.Dig a little deeper, and you'll realize that no, Americans really aren't making better choices; instead, they think they are. For instance, smoking is on the decline, but vaping is on the uptick. And while vaping is a genuinely cleaner alternative to smoking, it's not inherently a healthy practice.As it relates to Pepsi, a Rasmussen poll from earlier this decade indicated that slightly more than half of Americans admit to having a sweet tooth. More recent polls suggest that our national obsession with sweet or sugary concoctions haven't changed. Despite consumer trends toward healthy food products, candy sales continue to increase. We're still consuming chocolate at a pronounced rate relative to other nations.In other words, the current and emergent generations are health-conscious; however, they are not healthier. Marketing Opportunities and Pepsi stockWhat the earnings report for PEP demonstrated quite clearly is that it does not have a product problem. Look at what drove overall revenues for the company: Pepsi sodas. This is the very product category that retail reports suggested would sink Pepsi stock because no one drinks soda anymore.Really? Tell that to the folks who drove PEP stock convincingly higher.But it's not just that consumers are drinking more soda, or that the doom-and-gloom forecasts for this industry were premature. People consumed a substantial amount of Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar. What incentivized them to make that choice? Marketing.In all seriousness, Diet Pepsi and these zero-sugar beverages are probably the most damaging beverages you can legally obtain. I mean, what's making these drinks so sweet if there's no sugar? Most likely, it's some weird laboratory concoction with a name you can't pronounce.But from the perspective of Pepsico, do the health implications matter? Not at all. Again, we're not a healthy generation: we have the same dietary vices as those preceding us. We just like to be told we're healthy, even if the source has as much credibility as a used-car salesman.Therefore, PEP has a viable channel for continued growth, largely because they have an effective marketing team. Look, the company isn't just selling soda in a soda-unfriendly environment; it's also selling junk food like Lay's potato chips.Essentially, PEP is exporting ice to Eskimos, and the Eskimos can't get enough of it. The bull case for Pepsi stock is alive and well.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-04-22,Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow.,Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch
2019-04-22,"Within economics and the financial markets, you must deal with the trade-off concept. For instance, if you want to strike it rich quickly, you're likely looking at upstart organizations with strong potential. However, you have to give up the proven stability of a blue-chip name. This dynamic also applies to high-yielding dividend stocks to buy.Almost everyone loves the idea of passive income. You take a great company with a generous yield and sit back and collect the dividend. However, the most generous dividend stocks are usually the riskiest. Sure, you can find several companies that pay out double-digit yields. The question is, are these investments sustainable? Usually, the answer is no.Fortunately, the markets aren't always the most efficient platform for assessing value. While I don't want to debate various economic theories, it's fair to say not all high-yielding dividend stocks are speculative. In fact, many of the names you'll see below are worldwide recognizable brands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees For this list, I've picked out 10 publicly traded companies that have a dividend yield of at least 3%. In fact, they average well over 5%. However, these are organizations that, while risky, offer viable products and services.In other words, these are not fly-by-night operations. So without further ado, here are 10 high-yielding dividend stocks to buy that won't wilt! High-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy: Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 3.4%Over the past few years, several investors -- even those who seek high-yielding dividend stocks -- have avoided Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). At first, such evasion seems strange. After all, an investment in KO is levered toward a global powerhouse brand. Additionally, Coca-Cola has consistently grown its payout across several decades.However, its current 3.4% yield isn't enough for many to overlook the soda industry's declining relevance. Research reports indicate that millennials eschew sugary, carbonated drinks for healthier beverages. As such, sector players have had to adjust to this changing landscape, offering more choices that cater to health-conscious buyers.Here's the thing about KO stock. Despite its volatility, the underlying company has made those changes. Its rebranding efforts, particularly with Diet Coke, resulted in notable successes. Furthermore, I demonstrated that millennials aren't necessarily healthier. Instead, they want to think that they're making healthier choices.My argument is that Coca-Cola has a chance, as long as they keep their marketing on point. Olin Corporation (OLN)Dividend Yield: 3.3%We're seeing tremendous changes in our economy, and they may be just the beginning. It's no longer a matter of science fiction to assume a world of robots and automation. So if you're looking for dividend stocks to buy that can survive this coming age, you should check out Olin Corporation (NYSE:OLN).OLN specializes in industrial chemicals, which doesn't sound like a next-generation sector because it isn't. However, to actualize the benefits of technology, you still require a physical infrastructure. For example, Olin's expertise in developing epoxy products is critical for the energy, transportation and civil engineering industries.  * 7 Tech Stocks With Too Much Risk, Not Enough Upside Another driving force that supports Olin's 3.3% dividend yield is its Winchester ammunition brand. As you know, Americans love their guns. In fact, we have more guns in this country than we have people. That equates to a lot of shooting, which equates to OLN being one of the safest high-yielding dividend stocks you can get. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Source: GothamNurse Via FlickrDividend Yield: 3.3%Invariably, most of the exciting stocks to buy focus on the industries of tomorrow, such as automation and artificial intelligence. But no matter how much we progress as a society, we've got to eat. That simple, unavoidable fact helps drive agricultural company Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM).Of course, the icy U.S.-China relationship has disproportionately impacted domestic agriculture. Therefore, ADM stock slid sharply during the second half of last year. However, the Archer Daniels brand is a powerful one, featuring a strong international presence with the capacity to boot.Currently, ADM pays out a 3.3% dividend yield, and I don't see that being in any trouble. Primarily, the company has a strong history of consistent payouts that extend back for decades. Second, the importance of its core industry suggests that ADM will remain one of the most relevant dividend stocks. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4%Among high-yielding dividend stocks to buy, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) has one of the most balanced cases. I said as much when I covered XOM stock around mid-April. The company generates immediate interest for its history of strong payouts and its dominant position in the energy industry. With a 4% yield, this is a tough investment to ignore.At the same time, XOM stock has suffered significant setbacks. Although we're years removed from the energy crisis of 2014 and 2015, the sector is still recovering from it. Big oil firms like Exxon Mobil are no exception. Plus, we're seeing a decided push toward green-energy solutions, which hurts the case for XOM.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm So how should investors approach the oil giant? If you're seeking a nearer-term profit, I don't like some of the immediate headwinds affecting shares, though oil prices are surging on news that the U.S. might be lifting waivers on Iran sanctions. But for the longer run, I believe XOM has critical infrastructures and assets that still represent viable energy sources. Duke Energy (DUK)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.2%During a particularly brutal heatwave in the southwestern region of California and Arizona in September 2011, a botched maintenance procedure knocked out critical power channels. San Diego went dark, as did parts of Tijuana, Mexico and western Arizona. I went through the experience and I immediately recognized the fragility of our digitalized economy.Sure, we may be the most advanced nation in the world, but all it takes is one silly mistake to undo everything. In that sense, I think every portfolio should include dividend stocks that have some exposure to the utilities sector. Among them, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) has provided its shareholders with a mix of capital gains and strong passive income.While utility firms aren't the sexiest names in the investing world, they are incredibly vital. As we dive further into an automated industry, the one thing we cannot live without is power. For that reason, the 4.2% yield that underlines DUK stock is well justified. International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.5%Admittedly, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) isn't the most exciting name among dividend stocks to buy. For most of this decade, IBM shares have gone sideways, ultimately impressing neither the bulls nor the bears. However, a strong performance this year suggests that calls for its death were premature.After all, IBM has a long history of innovation and forwarding pioneering technologies. Although they don't get as much coverage as they used to, &quot;Big Blue&quot; has made exciting progress with AI. Recently, the company revealed that they use AI to accurately forecast which workers will quit their jobs. IBM claims that they saved nearly $300 million in retention costs with their digital program.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for Spring Season Growth Of course, AI has its ups and downs. For instance, IBM had to shut down a segment of its Watson Health division because it didn't generate enough profit. Still, it has demonstrated significant potential. Plus, that 4.5% yield looks awfully attractive right now. AMC Entertainment (AMC)Dividend Yield: 5.1%Back when consumers had fewer options, cineplex operate AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) made plenty of sense. But in the streaming era, AMC simply appears outdated and irrelevant. In this day and age, who would want to go somewhere to watch something? Moreover, when the box office bombed in 2017, AMC shares cratered.Still, I look at this company as one of the more intriguing dividend stocks to buy. Yes, I own some shares, but it's more important to focus on why I do, as opposed to merely the fact that I do. It comes down to this: AMC provides a social experience that you'll never get from streaming services or other &quot;isolated&quot; platforms.Moreover, the movie industry has shifted its priorities to accommodate the new entertainment landscape. Production studios now dedicate most of their resources to proven winners, such as comic-book based movies or established franchises. I'm hardly surprised that Captain Marvel is the biggest movie so far this year. Nerds eat this stuff up.Better yet, box office receipts prove that nerds have taken over Hollywood. That alone provides justification for AMC's 5%-plus dividend yield. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.2%Ordinarily, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has been one of the most consistent performers among dividend stocks to buy. Taking away the events from last year, ABBV stock provided generally steady returns, making its payout worthwhile. Obviously, its exposure to the pivotal healthcare sector makes AbbVie a perpetually relevant name.That said, 2018 was a rough year for the pharmaceutical giant. Moreover, shifting political dynamics bring many questions to the industry. For instance, several prominent Democrats support the &quot;Medicare for All Act.&quot; Such a comprehensive plan will shine a glaring spotlight on pharmaceutical pricing, potentially hurting profitability.  * 7 Stocks That Can Outperform for Years Naturally, if Democrats take over the White House, that's a political headwind for ABBV stock. However, there's also the likelihood that Medicare for All will drive revenues back home. For instance, many Americans go to Mexico to buy prescription drugs. If we can establish fair, sensible pricing, pharmaceutical firms may benefit from an untapped revenue source. AT&T (T)Dividend Yield: 6.4%When telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE:T) first proposed buying out Time Warner, I'm sure more than a few eyes rolled. Before the deal, T stock suffered from a massive debt load. With the deal, that situation obviously did not improve. Therefore, I understand why many folks have run for the hills.Also, the company's tremendously high 6.4% yield appears a little too generous. Yes, AT&T historically has been one of the top names among blue-chip dividend stocks. But with such a huge liability clouding everything, that yield seems like a trap.Unfortunately, in high-barrier industries, you've got to pay to play. While the Time Warner deal hurts the balance sheet, it gives T stock exposure to the lucrative content-streaming market. Plus, they're one of the few alpha dogs that can implement the 5G rollout.Lastly, let's just acknowledge that AT&T is too big to fail. Like it or not, their success is vital to progressing the American economic machinery. That's a very comfortable explanation why T stands out among other dividend stocks. GameStop (GME)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 17.3%GameStop (NYSE:GME) recently proved that the adage that struggling companies have had their bad news priced in is just that: an adage. After failing to find a buyer earlier this year, GME shares tumbled badly. However, a very poor showing in the fourth quarter added even more pain to an already ugly show.Ironically, one of GameStop's most attractive elements -- the crazy-high yield -- is too awe-striking for its own good. After all, how many dividend stocks with a yield of over 17% ended up surviving? When a company is paying you more than twice the average return of the S&P 500, there's a reason for that. Typically, it's not a good one.Although this is an incredibly risky idea, it's worth noting that digital video game downloads may eventually hit a wall. I say this because many popular games have sizes exceeding 100 gigabytes. After downloading a couple titles, gamers will have to buy an external hard drive, which can easily run around $50.  * 5 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees Or, they can just go to GameStop and pick up used games on the cheap.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long AMC and AT&T.

2019-04-23,"Last year was terrible for the equity markets, as most stocks bottomed on Christmas. But not Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) -- it made a new low just after its last earnings report in February. Luckily for the bulls, it has since mounted a 7% rally off those lows. And more importantly, it's rallying again today on another earnings report card.Source: Coca-ColaManagement delivered a strong quarter in spite of currency headwinds. KO is supposed to be a boring company, but it managed to report 6% organic growth. They even had a few success stories with new flavors.It wasn't long ago when experts had rang the death knell for soda, yet here is Coke proving them wrong. They even guided a bit higher going forward. So they didn't leave much reason to sell the stock on the headline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNevertheless, KO stock came into the earnings event this morning absolutely flat for the year. This morning's rally, if it holds, will be the base for the year. For the past 12 months, Coke stock is in line with the S&P 500, so maybe it plays catch up for this year to right the shorter-term metric.This morning's pop in the stock almost but not completely closes the open gap to $49.50. This is a small concern for the short term, but the zone just above it could be the doorway for more green.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt If the KO stock bulls can maintain the rally and close above $50 per share, they could spark a bullish pattern to target $52 or higher. But that won't be easy, as it would need the help of the broader equity markets. This is not a momentum stock so it's won't move as fast as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), for example. So big moves need bigger reasons. This report, while good, is not enough alone. KO stock needs market-wide follow through to reach new all-time highs too.So what now? Looking Ahead in KO StockFundamentally, KO stock is twice as expensive as Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP). Even in absolute terms, KO's 32 trailing price-to-earnings ratio is bloated. This is roughly twice as expensive as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and 30% more expensive than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).If I already own the shares, I am happy about the rally but it's not reason to add to my position. For those looking to start a new position in Coca-Cola stock, they need to determine their time frame. If it's a fundamental position to hold for years to come, then there is no sense in fishing for the perfect entry point. Over the long haul, KO will do well -- especially since it pays a 3.3% dividends to boot.But those who prefer to actively trade Coke stock shorter term have a few lines to know. The first is that this morning's zone is in theory resistance. Onus is on the bulls to breakout through so they would invite momentum buyers.Conversely, there is a long-shot bearish scenario that could unfold on the long-term chart. If for any reason KO falls below $44 per share, it could trigger a large bearish pattern that could target $39 per share. This is not a forecast, it is a possible scenario that bulls need to know.Coca-Cola is a consistent stock that will not cause great harm to portfolios. But that alone is not a reason to follow a spike on impulse. I'd rather wait a few days to see how the bulls are able to handle these prior-fail levels that have lingered since January of 2018.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-04-24,"U.S. stock futures are circling unchanged this morning as traders take a breather following yesterday's fresh highs in the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500.Source: Shutterstock Ahead of the bell, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up 0.05%, and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.04%. Nasdaq-100 futures have added 0.01%.In the options pits, the dash to record highs generated increasing volumes. As you might expect, calls led the bulls' charge. Specifically, about 20 million calls and 15.1 million puts changed hands on the session.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMeanwhile, over at the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio remains as uninspiring as ever. It slipped to 0.59 but continues to fiddle in the middle of 2019's range. The 10-day moving average matched the action by falling to 0.59.Options activity was juiced in the following stocks. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) popped on earnings after topping expectations. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) added to its large gains following its surprise settlement with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Finally, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) calls were hot ahead of tonight's earnings announcement.Let's take a closer look: Coca-Cola (KO)Coca-Cola released its first-quarter earnings before the bell Tuesday and beat expectations. Adjusted earnings grew to 48 cents per share, beating estimates by 2 cents. And revenue climbed to $8.02 billion, handily beating forecasts for $7.9 billion.  * 10 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks That Won't Wilt KO stock saw a volatile session, ultimately ending up 1.75% on the day. The jump lands it square in the middle of last quarter's earnings gap, which should continue to fill. Look for KO to return to $50 in the coming days.On the options trading front, traders came after calls like sugar-deprived kids to soda. Activity fizzed to 424% of the average daily volume, with 113,617 total contracts traded; 82% of the trading came from call options alone.The 1.75% price jump fell well within market expectations. Premiums were baking in a 3.1% move on earnings, so chalk this up as a win for volatility sellers. The post-earnings volatility crush was on full display, driving the metric down to 15% or the 19th percentile of its one-year range. Qualcomm (QCOM)The rocket ship ride in Qualcomm continued in earnest, adding another 5.8% to its already immense gains. QCOM stock now sits at 19-year highs and is well on its way to revisiting its record peak of $100 reached during the dot-com craze.Traders favoring low-risk, high-reward setups should steer clear of QCOM right now. It's a momentum-drive move that is now extremely overbought. A pause or pullback would allow the stretched conditions to ease and lower-risk entries to develop.As far as options trading goes, the Street continues to heavily favor call options. The volume explosion continued on Tuesday with activity ramping to 409% of the average daily volume. By day's end, the total contracts traded eclipsed the half a million mark at 509,837 contracts traded. Calls claimed 67% of the sum.Implied volatility inched higher to 39% placing it at the 73rd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of $2.14 or 2.5%. Qualcomm's earnings report is slated for May 1. Microsoft (MSFT)The current stage of our bull market has the Nasdaq-100 to thank. And although many tech stocks are throwing their weight behind the Nasdaq's dominance, it's Microsoft that has arguably been the most consistent helper.MSFT stock set yet another record high yesterday. With the 1.5% rise, its year-to-date gains have now grown to 24%. Its price trend is a beauty, complete with rising moving averages across all time frames. Accumulation days litter the landscape with nary a whiff of distribution. You bet against buyers at your peril here.The theme of call popularity continued with MSFT.

2019-04-30,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in Jan. 2019. It has since been updated and republished.]When it comes to tech stocks a lot of ink has been spilled on the so-called FANG stocks. And for good reason. Leaders like Facebook (NYSE:FB) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) have been dominant forces in the sector and have shaken-up their respective technology subsectors since the end of the Great Recession. The problem is,as we continue to focus on the FANGs, plenty of other tech stocks have gone unnoticed. After all, there's more to the technology sector than just Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).In fact, there's a lot more.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome of the best tech stocks continue to fly under the radar as the focus continues to be on FAANG stocks. For investors, looking at them could provide some of the best long-term growth potential around.But which firms have the goods to help get your mind off the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and NFLX?  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares Here are five tech stocks worth a look. Tech Stocks That Are Not FANG: The Trade Desk (TTD)Advertising today is nothing like an episode of Mad Men. As various digital platforms have exploded in use, marketers and advertisers have been forced to adapt to the shifting landscape. Helping them adapt to that shift and target the right customer at the right time is The Trade Desk (NYSE:TTD).The idea behind TTD is simple enough. Dubbed &quot;programmatic advertising,&quot; Trade Desk will use high-speed computers and various algorithms to automate the process of ad buying in real time. By searching the nearly 20 digital-ad exchanges, TTD allows advertisers to instantly find exactly who they want to target their ad to -- whether that's on their computer, smartphone or other devices. Trade Desk's programs are so fast and successful, they are able to place roughly 9 million ads per second through their online auctions.In the end, it creates a much more efficient and cost-effective way for companies to reach consumers.For TTD, this creates plenty of revenues and growth. As Trade Desk has been able to score more customers, the Trade desk saw its revenue jump by 56% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. The best part of that jump was that two of firm's main growth engines -- video and connected TV advertising -- are just really getting started. That leaves plenty of room for TTD to continue its pace of huge revenue jumps. Even better, TTD stock is profitable.All in all, the Trade Desk has what it takes to be one of the best tech stocks outside the FANGs. Tech Stocks That Are Not FANG: Workday (WDAY)Cloud computing has really changed the way we function these days. So, naturally, tech stocks leading the way into the cloud are worthy FANG replacements. And Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) may be one of the best.Human Resources is full of tedious tasks such as changing ACH payroll information, filling out expense reports or signing up for a retirement/401k plan. Often these things get in the way of allowing the HR staff to do meaningful work. WDAY makes a variety of applications for small or large businesses to cover these tasks. The best part is, like many cloud computing firms, a business can add as little or as much as they like. And rather than purchasing the service, they pay a reoccurring fee.For Workday, this has all added up to some great growth. During Q4, WDAY saw a huge 35.4% jump to its total revenues, while subscriptions revenues came in at $673.5 million -- a 30% year-over-year jump. The best part is that its subscription revenue backlog -- that is, sales that are not officially booked, but will be as because companies have signed up for multi-term products -- came in at over $6.7 billion.With key high-margined products -- such as WDAY's business intelligence offering, Prism Analytics -- growing like weeds, the pace of revenues should continue. Moreover, it should allow Workday to finally move into the black when it comes to GAAP accounting standards.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares All in all, Workday is quickly becoming a go-to name in HR management. For investors, that makes one serious tech stock to have your portfolio. Tech Stocks That Are Not FANG: Twilio (TWLO)Want to forget the FANGs? A 278% return will help you do it. And that's just what investors in Twilio (NASDAQ:TWLO) were treated to last year. That return was one of the best among all tech stocks -- FANG's included. There's plenty of reasons why TWLO could see more gains ahead.Twilio designs cloud-based communications platforms that allow developers to send automated phone calls, text messages, and other communication functions. For example, when you're doing a bit of online shopping or banking and you see one of those chat boxes that allows you ask questions or find out more about a product or account, Twilio made that happen. The awesome part is that developers can simply take TWLO's APIs and apps, chuck them into their code and instantly get the ability to add these functions. TWLO collects a fee when consumers use the functions.And collect fees it does.As of the end of the third quarter, TWLO had roughly 64,300 different customers using their apps.  In Q4 alone, revenues jumped by 77% as both organic and new customer growth surged. And there's still plenty of room to grow across a variety of customers.Given the ease of TWLO's products and the continued growth potential, it's easy to see how the tech stock will a giant over the long haul. That's assuming it doesn't get bought out first. Tech Stocks That Are Not FANG: Splunk (SPLK)As technology has invaded our lives, we create a lot of data. In fact, we make so much of it, a new term &quot;Big Data&quot; was invented to describe the billions of gigabytes of info we generate. The problem for businesses is how to comprehend that data and dig into it to gain actual knowledge. Software firm Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) hopes to provide the answers.At its core, Splunk provides a variety of tools and businesses intelligence software to collect, manage and analyze all the data various organizations make. This includes everything from machine learning and application analysis to cybersecurity and business analytics. The win is that SPLK's applications are set-up to use a simple website-style interface. You don't need to be a developer to use or understand the software.This ease of use and ability to comb through all the data has a lot of fans. Some of SPLK's customers include Zillow (NYSE:Z), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and AAA.Naturally, all of this love for Big Data has created some big revenues for the tech stock. In Q4, revenues jumped 35% year-over-year.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares When it comes to tech stocks, Splunk is the reigning big data king. Tech Stocks That Are Not FANG: Fortinet Inc (FTNT)Not to be confused with the popular video game Fortnite, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) could be one of the best tech stocks out there. And that's because of what it targets: cybersecurity.With hacks, data breaches and other cyber threats on the rise, protecting a network is of utmost importance. And it's only getting much more important as we move into the cloud, conduct more banking online and live more complicated digital lives. It's FTNT's job to make sure a company's or your data doesn't fall into the hands of hackers. It develops and markets various cybersecurity software as well as devices such as firewalls, anti-virus, intrusion prevention, VPNs and endpoint security products. Basically, all the stuff you'd need to build a secure network.And given the high-profile nature of several recent data breaches, FTNT is supplying a lot of stuff. In Q4, its revenues grew at 22%. More importantly, the  company's 2019 EPS guidance came in well above the consensus outlookWith digital threats continuing to grow, Fortinet is poised to be one of the biggest winners among tech stocks.Disclosure: As of the time of writing, Aaron Levitt held no position in any stock mentioned.

2019-04-30,"Off and on the price chart, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is in once again with Wall Street. But before investors make any buying decisions in KO stock, it may be wise to make sure the bubbly price action doesn't turn entirely flat. Let me explain.Source: Coca-ColaInvestors hoping for better-than-feared results from Coca-Cola following last quarter's weak-looking forecast were served a surprisingly sweet corporate confessional this past Tuesday. By the numbers, the beverage giant delivered a two cent profit beat on earnings of 48 cents on sales of $8.02 billion versus Q1 estimates of $7.88 billion.The top- and bottom-line beat was highlighted by overall strong international sales from Coke's water and juice products and a sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth from its signature Coca-Cola Zero Sugar soda beverage.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bubbly results also had CEO James Quincy backing away from KO stock's challenging Q4 &quot;blip&quot; and prior warnings. In its place, upbeat dialogue of 'disciplined growth strategies continuing to deliver strong underlying performance' was offered.  * 7 Stocks to Buy That Ought to Buy Back Shares For their part, investors guzzled down KO shares resulting in a healthy, single serving 1.7% performance. Still, before you think Coke is it again for your trading account, waiting for last week's fizz to show a bit more sustainability on the price chart looks about right. KO Stock Daily Price ChartKO stock enjoyed a nice week off and on the price chart. Technically, though, there's more work to be done. Overall relative weakness the past couple months has at least one more hurdle to clear before a more meaningful pop in share price to fresh all-time-highs can be realized.The daily chart shows that since last December KO has established a high-level, corrective double-bottom pattern within its longer-term uptrend. Shares are now in the upper right side of the base. That's good news, but it's not a green light to buy shares. At current prices, KO stock faces possible resistance from the pattern's mid-pivot and an angular downtrend line. KO Stock Long Stock StrategyGiven the dueling patterns, I'd recommend bullish investors wait before buying KO stock. If shares manage to consolidate laterally for several more sessions, a breakout through last week's high of $48.72 would also allow for Coca Cola to rally above the described angular resistance. The additional time spent digesting gains and with shares knocking out two potential threats is price action worth buying into.Should this scenario play out, placing a stop-loss beneath the low of the price congestion in KO stock and taking partial profits at two times that risk makes sense.Alternatively, if KO stock &quot;is it&quot; sooner rather than later, I'd let the price pop go and watch from the sidelines. Bottom line, with the mid-pivot and prior quarter's bearish gap slightly above last week's high, I'd expect a small, but healthy contraction on the price chart to develop. Without it, the belief is KO bulls will be facing increased odds of failure with any purchased long stock positions.Here, too, if an eventual purchase under these guidelines does occur, minimizing risk by setting a stop-loss below the consolidation and trimming the position as the reward grows to twice the initial exposure makes sense off and on the price chart.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-04-30,"The bull case for Charlotte's Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF) stock seems reasonably easy to make. The producer of hemp and hemp-derived CBD (cannabidiol) oil has a massive growth opportunity akin to that of marijuana stocks. Yet with the passage of the Farm Bill late last year, Charlotte's Web products should be clearly legal in the U.S. That suggests a larger, nearer-term market opportunity for Charlotte's Web - and perhaps more potential near-term gains for Charlotte's Web stock.Source: Shutterstock Indeed, I recommended Charlotte's Web stock at the end of last year. That's proven to be a smart call. CWBHF stock has gained nicely, rising about 70%. Those gains are roughly in line with most marijuana stocks: Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has gained 80%, and Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) about 60%. Clearly, optimism toward the Farm Bill and a broader 'risk-on' sentiment in equity markets have helped cannabis and hemp stocks across the board.At current levels, however, there are risks to CWBHF stock. Marijuana stocks on the whole look potentially stretched, and while Charlotte's Web has some advantages over that group, its valuation too incorporates quite a bit of growth. An awful lot of good news seems priced in at this point - but there are risks that could send Charlotte's Web stock tumbling.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 A-Rated Stocks That Are Under $10  The Valuation of Charlotte's Web StockThe story behind Charlotte's Web, as a business, looks attractive. The company is a leader, and likely the leader, in the growing CBD oil space. Its hemp production has soared, rising more than tenfold to 675,000 pounds in 2018, per the Q4 release. And now larger retailers are coming on board: Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD) both announced recently that they would add CBD products to their stores.In other words, there are several avenues for growth. Charlotte's Web has the potential to take market share in what looks to be an extremely fragmented industry, either through acquisitions or through the eventual failure of some of the myriad producers in CBD. Points of distribution are going to rise. Charlotte's Web on its website cites 4,000 retail locations at the moment. Walgreens has over 18,000 stores, and Rite Aid nearly 2,500.To be sure, neither Walgreens nor Rite Aid is launching CBD products in all of its stores immediately. Rite Aid is limiting its initial exposure to just topical products in a few states. But the broad point still holds: Charlotte's Web can take more share in a market set to reach more customers through more stores.One key risk, however, is that the story isn't exactly unknown by investors at this point. Charlotte's Web stock now has a market capitalization over $2 billion. It trades at about 30x 2018 revenue and 100x 2018 Adjusted EBITDA. Those are huge numbers, mostly in line with larger marijuana stocks. Yet Charlotte's Web, in part because it had a larger 2017 base, isn't growing as fast as most THC-based companies.Sales rose 'just' 74% in 2018. That's an impressive rate, certainly, but lags the triple-digit rates seen elsewhere in the space. Adjusted EBITDA rose 48%. But that includes a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter. As impressive as Charlotte's Web market opportunity is, recent growth must repeat for years to support the current valuation. Anything less simply isn't good enough. Is CBD a Fad?And that growth requires that CBD demand continue to grow at the same nearly exponential rate at which it has of late. That seems possible but hardly guaranteed. The Charlotte's Web origin story, as Matt McCall detailed in calling Charlotte's Web stock his best pick for 2019, is that a girl named Charlotte saw her seizures decrease dramatically when she started taking CBD oil. Many other customers swear by the product for myriad other uses.But as the New York Times pointed out in February, at least so far there's little scientific evidence backing the effectiveness of CBD oil. In fact, there's little standardization even of dosing, particularly given the various types of applications. Swallowing CBD oil results in a very different dose of cannabidiol than a topical cream.Anecdotal evidence appears to support some use for the product, admittedly. But advocates and CHWBF bulls are expecting adoption and persistence rates to stay as high going forward as they have been of late.It remains to be seen whether that will be the case. A product that supposedly cures so many afflictions will inspire demand. But it will also raise expectations. If new customers expect CBD oil to be a super-supplement and it fails, what then?Indeed, we've seen similar trends come and go, particularly in dieting. Atkins was huge, then it faded. Gluten-free sales soared among customers without specific allergies, then faded.CBD oil obviously is different from those products. But there's still a valid question: is it a wonder drug, or just another fad that will come and go? At this point, the jury still is out. Where Do Margins Go?Even assuming the market continues to grow, there's a key question in terms of profit margins: what does a mature CBD market look like? Is it akin to food and beverage markets, where there are differentiated, branded products at the high end and low end? Or does CBD, the benefits of which supposedly are based on the underlying compound, become commoditized?This question is key for marijuana stocks as well. But in CBD, it seems even more pressing. Charlotte's Web at the moment has an edge over smaller rivals because it seems more trustworthy. It's been around longer. It's respected. Consumers can trust the manufacturing process, and trust that the CBD content is accurately measured. Smaller, less well-known rivals may not have the same level of trust.At some point, however, that changes. A major company like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) may enter the space. Or clearer legalization may allow for more standardized manufacturing and more transparent production processes and labeling.If CBD oil is simply a commodity, Charlotte's Web almost certainly loses pricing power. If there's no &quot;better&quot; CBD oil, producers will compete more on price and less on branding. Charlotte's Web's first-mover advantage will evaporate and margins will decline.There are similar worries on the cannabis side. Legalization in Oregon, for instance, has led to plunging prices. The same Farm Bill that led to so much optimism behind Charlotte's Web stock could lead to a similar outcome in CBD oil. And at 100x EBITDA and 130x net income, Charlotte's Web stock is not priced for falling prices or stagnant margins.That's the broad worry at this point. Even with a decline in recent sessions, Charlotte's Web stock still looks priced for something close to perfection. But risks lurk. At this price, it only takes one of the risks to lead CWHBF to tumble.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-07,"In most cases, trying to pinpoint the best entry spot into a new position is a lost cause. Either a stock doesn't ebb and flow predictably enough, or waiting ends up meaning a trader ultimately misses out on gains. The market's very best stocks have a knack for making prolonged rallies, never pulling back and opening a window of opportunity.There are exceptions, however. That is to say, some stocks are forever rising and falling in a pattern, making long-term net progress, even if not rising in a straight line.  * 10 Lithium Stocks to Buy Despite the Market's Irrationality To that end, here's a rundown of the market's best stocks to buy on a decent dip. They're not necessarily ripe for a purchase right now, but they each sport enough long-term momentum and the right fundamentals to recover from a future stumble as well as they have in the past.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  Click to EnlargeJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock may not always soar to higher highs. But, even when the market environment is lousy and the economy is in shambles, JNJ stock finds a way of hammering out some degree of progress. Its stumbles are always short-lived before yielding to a move above its prior peak.That persistence has everything to do with the nature of its business. Johnson & Johnson sells a mix of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol and Zyrtec and a variety of medical equipment. Its top and bottom lines don't move in a perfectly straight line, but they broadly move higher all the time.There is a catch with JNJ stock, however. While it can and usually does recover pretty quickly, there's no rhythm or pattern to its pullbacks and rebounds. Verizon Communications (VZ)  Click to EnlargeThe telecom industry is changing. It's getting tougher to be in, as the lines between phone and video -- and now entertainment -- continue to blur.Nobody knows that better than the chiefs at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), which acquired a struggling Yahoo with plans to use that as a springboard into the streaming video arena. It has not worked out very well, with the company writing down $5 billion last year to adjust for the deteriorating value of its Yahoo and AOL properties.Unlike its biggest rival AT&T (NYSE:T), however, Verizon hasn't taken on too much outside of the telecom realm. Revenue growth has been surprisingly steady, even if income growth hasn't been quite as consistent. It's the erratic bottom line largely responsible for the pullbacks the stock has been dishing out since 2010.  * 10 Vice Stocks to Spice Up Your Portfolio Take a closer look at those lulls though. Just when it looks like the stock's never going to recover, it does. Goldman Sachs Group (GS)  Click to EnlargeGoldman Sachs Group (NYSE:GS) used to be a titan, and arguably the premier name in the investment banking business. That's not the case anymore. Through a combination of more competition and a lack of effective focus, Goldman lost a step.Investors have taken notice. It was earnings lulls that largely drove the 2011, 2015 and 2018 setbacks for GS stock. Those were big selloffs too. Last year's tumble was almost a 50% meltdown from peak to trough.Those troughs have been great buying opportunities though, since if nothing else, Goldman Sachs can lean on its pedigree while it regroups to restore earnings growth. There's also a support line that appears to be playing a role in the stock's recoveries now. Lowe's Companies (LOW)  Click to EnlargeHardware store chain Lowe's Companies (NYSE:LOW) has always played second fiddle to bigger rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and perhaps hasn't performed as well as it would have liked because Home Depot was forever standing in the way.The second-biggest home improvement retailer is no slouch, however. As long as the economy and housing market are on solid footing, Lowe's is growing too, securing its spot on a list of the best stocks to buy on a dip.  * 7 Tips for Financial Planners to Gain a Competitive Edge The weekly chart of LOW confirms it. The weekly chart also makes clear that this particular stock ebbs and flows in a rhythm, and more often than not, it turns around when it bumps into previously established support and resistance lines. Medtronic (MDT)  Click to EnlargeMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) makes and markets a variety of medical devices, ranging from pacemakers to dialysis catheters to electrosurgical instruments.Yes, as was the case with Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic's business is reliable from one quarter -- and one year -- to the next. The tradeoff is, red-hot growth is incredibly unlikely.It's a dynamic investors generally have a tough time remembering, given the stock's up-and-down action. The market will bid it up to unsustainable values, and when they correct that move, they overdo the downturns as well. The end result is a relatively well-established zig-zag pattern that since 2015 has been framed by equally well-established support and resistance lines.It looks as if MDT shares just pushed up and off the lower boundary of that rising trading range. WEC Energy Group (WEC)  Click to EnlargeThere's rarely a bad time to own a utility stock. While they offer little in the way of growth, they offer much in the way of consistency. They're also solid dividend payers, even if they rise and fall like bonds when interest rates fall and rise.WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC) isn't an exception to that norm.Yes, it's a bit off the radar. WEC Energy serves only 4.5 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.  * 7 ETFs for Investors With a Gambler's Spirit That obscurity is the edge investors have, however. It's not overwatched and overinvested the way bigger names like Southern Co (NYSE:SO) and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) are. That dynamic allows it to move without an unnatural level of buying and selling pressure; instead, moving back and forth in a well-established pattern clearly framed by support and resistance levels. It just bumped into the upper boundary of that ceiling, so investors looking to step in will probably have to wait a while. Dollar Tree (DLTR)  Click to EnlargeDollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) is a curious bird. One would think the deep discounter would thrive when the economy is in shambles and struggle when the economy is thriving.That has not necessarily been the case though. In fact, there has been no apparent link to the economy in a long time for DLTR stock. It just moves higher in any kind of environment, in step with unfettered sales and earnings growth. Last quarter's slight sales lull is the first time since 2014 the top line has shrunk. Before that, it hadn't happened since the end of 2007. That consistency is the key reason DLTR has earned a spot on a list of the best stocks to buy after a pullback.Just for the record, however, the pullbacks Dollar Tree shares are dishing out on a regular basis are uncomfortably big. The trip from the upper edge of a long-term trading range to the lower end of that range last year cut DLTR by about a third of its value. Coca-Cola (KO)  Click to EnlargeConsumers may be steering away from sugary sodas, but that's hardly all Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is anymore. Dasani water, Honest T tea and Zico coconut water are just some of its healthier options that consumers are clamoring for these days. That diverse product lineup is a key reason the company's sales and earnings have been predictable, even if not always moving forward.The beverage business runs (no pun intended) hot and cold, and that can push KO stock higher and lower by quite a bit.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks That Are Bleeding Cash Take a step back and look at the weekly chart though. You'll find that what feels like sizeable pullbacks at the time ends up being opportunities to step into a long-term uptrend right as the lower boundary of a rising channel is met. Micron Technology (MU)  Click to EnlargeShares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) ebb and fall regularly too, but their cycle can take an agonizingly long time to complete. Whereas other names that make for great &quot;buy on a dip&quot; prospects may peel back for a few weeks, Micron shares can slide for over a year.In every case so far, though, the recovery has more than offset the setback.The cycle in question is neither a psychological nor an economic one. It's a tech-based one. The computer memory market is in the nasty habit of over-responding to rising RAM prices, creating too much production capacity that leads to a price-gouging glut. That's what up-ended MU stock in 2018, and again last year.The tough part about using these selloffs is being patient enough to let them run their full course before filing back in. United Parcel Service (UPS)  Click to EnlargeFinally, add United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) to your watchlist of stocks to buy after a major pullback.UPS contends with a variety of headwinds, ranging from economic lulls to fuel prices to competitive pressures. None of them are easy, and all of them are capable of taking a toll on United Parcel Service shares with or without notice. The weekly chart of UPS is visibly, alarmingly erratic.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 Take a closer look at that chart though. While sea-sickening at times, all of the dips since 2009 have been great short-term buying opportunities. Several of them wound up being great long-term entry points. The challenge is just mustering the guts to take the swing, trusting that United Parcel Service is capable of addressing its challenges immediately after they surface.

What we do know is traders reacted negatively to it because anything that could disrupt global economic growth is viewed as bearish for stocks. Not surprisingly, the S&P 500 dropped before the opening bell and has been bouncing back and forth today.So what do traders do in situations like these? Do they start panicking and sell all of their bullish positions? No. They start shifting some of their assets into more conservative bullish positions like KO. A Conservative Bullish StockKO is considered to be a conservative bullish stock because it's a stable, large-cap company in the Consumer Staples sector. Consumer Staples stocks enjoy the reputation of being consistent revenue producers in both good and bad economic times because consumers will buy their products regardless of what is happening in the economy.This is certainly true for KO. It doesn't matter if we're in an economic expansion or recession. Consumers are always getting their Coke fix.Plus, with KO's strong, consistent dividend payment and a raft of new products -- from Coke Energy and Coke Coffee to Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla -- the company is poised to continue growing and capturing market share. Support at $48If we turn to the daily chart, we see KO gapped up after its last earnings report -- despite missing earnings per share (EPS) expectations. Now the stock has found support at around $47.50, and we think it will stay above $48 for the next week. That makes it a good level to sell puts at.Daily Chart of Coca-Cola (KO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewKO encountered some resistance at $49, but because we like the fundamental picture, we think a short-term, bullish put write is in order.To find out which puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

2019-05-08,"Even in a broad market near all-time highs, it hasn't been a great time to be an income investor. Dividend stocks largely have underperformed. The winners this decade generally have been tech and/or growth stocks, most of which don't pay dividends. Adding insult to injury, of late there have been several high-profile dividend cuts in widely owned names.General Electric (NYSE:GE) in fact cut its dividend in both 2017 and 2018. It now pays just a penny per share each quarter. Owens & Minor (NYSE:OMI), a seemingly safe healthcare distributor that like GE was slow to adapt to changes in its industry, similarly executed a double cut, to just $0.0025 (a penny per year). Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) halved its payout last year to attack its debt load. Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) eliminated their dividends for similar reasons.All stocks wound up being yield traps -- dividend stocks that investors bought for yield, only to wind up losing both income and principal as the stocks fell. They are reminders that buying a stock just for its dividend is a risky, and even dangerous, strategy. An investor owning a stock needs to focus on the company -- not a single metric.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Great Stocks to Buy on Dips These 7 dividend stocks may not join the list of companies who cut their dividends soon -- or ever. But they are among the riskier stocks for income investors at the moment. An attractive dividend isn't so attractive when principal shrinks, offsetting those payouts. And all 7 of these dividend stocks seem to be at serious risk of at least seeing share price declines that will offset the high yields they offer at the moment. AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock AT&T (NYSE:T) appears to be an income investor's dream. T stock has been a &quot;widows and orphans&quot; stock since the days when it was still 'Ma Bell'. Even after the breakup, the move into cellular service, and the acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T stock still looks like a great dividend stock.It yields 6.67%, and in December announced its 35th consecutive annual increase, making T stock a so-called Dividend Aristocrat. That dividend still represents only about 57% of projected 2019 EPS, a reasonable payout ratio that leaves some room for AT&T to pay down its massive debt load.But I've long been skeptical toward AT&T stock -- and I continue to be so. The attractive dividend continues to be offset by a tumbling T stock price. Over the last five years, including dividends, AT&T stock has returned a little over 12% -- total. It's not just underperformed the market, it's barely outperformed Treasury bills at a time of historically low interest rates. Over the past year, T investors have made barely 1%; over the last three years, they've lost money including dividends while the S&P 500 has returned nearly 50% on the same basis.Simply put, T has been a disappointing investment. Looking forward, it's not clear how that is supposed to change. The cellular business is brutally competitive and at this point low-growth. The wireline business is declining. So is DIRECTV, and streaming service DIRECTV NOW is losing customers.Outside of HBO, Time Warner -- now WarnerMedia -- faces a real threat from cord-cutting. And AT&T' new streaming service seems unlikely to outcompete Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), let alone Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA).AT&T may keep its dividend rising. But that's been of little help to shareholders for most of this decade, and I'm skeptical that will change in the next one. Macerich (MAC)Source: Shutterstock Shopping mall REIT Macerich (NYSE:MAC) has offered an attractive yield for years now -- yet MAC stock keeps heading in the wrong direction. MAC trades near its lowest levels in almost eight years -- a decline that has driven the stock's dividend yield above 7%.At these levels, the dividend stock does look potentially attractive. MAC trades at a little over 11x the midpoint of 2019 guidance for FFO (funds from operations, a common adjusted net income figure used by REITs). The dividend yield is healthy. Support for the stock around $40 seems to have held since December. And the company's higher-end properties -- what it calls &quot;fortress malls&quot; -- in theory should better manage the changes in U.S. shopping patterns and the steady growth of e-commerce.The problem is that the same case could have been made for the past few years. Yet MAC's yield continued to creep up, touching 5% in 2017, 6% last year, and 7% this year. It's not higher payouts driving those increases (though Macerich has managed to increase its payout modestly in recent years). Rather, the declining MAC share price has driven those yields higher.The same phenomenon has played out elsewhere in the mall space, notably with lower-quality rivals Washington Prime (NYSE:WPG) and CBL & Associates (NYSE:CBL). Macerich still has a reasonably large debt load, and with the dividend payout about 80% of FFO, it may freeze increases or cut the payout to attack those borrowings. And any economic weakness can hit occupancy and cause real problems going forward.  * 5 Clean Energy ETFs to Buy for 2019 Macerich might look like it's at a bottom, but investors have believed that before, and been wrong in doing so. Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Source:  Hayden Irwin via FlickrOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is making a big bet on U.S. shale, with some help from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B). Backed by the issuance of $10 billion in preferred stock to Berkshire, Occidental seems likely to win its bidding war with Chevron (NYSE:CVX) for shale driller Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC).Whether that's good news for OXY stock remains to be seen. So far, investors seem displeased. OXY has sold off in recent sessions, and trades not far from multi-year lows. But, again, OXY is making a big bet, paying an estimated $38 billion for Anadarko against its current market capitalization of $44 billion. It is a high-risk play -- but one that also will offer high rewards if rising optimism toward U.S. shale proves correct.But for dividend stock investors, the deal raises a clear risk toward Occidental's payout. Analysts at Mizuho pointed out that dividend coverage may not be sufficient, particularly as the acquisition is integrated. Meanwhile, the Berkshire deal alone adds some $800 million in annual preferred stock distributions.And so it wouldn't be a surprise if Oxy cut or eliminated its dividend. Much like Anheuser-Busch after its takeover of SABMiller, Occidental will have significantly higher interest and distribution payments -- and may choose to redirect cash flow toward deleveraging. That might be the right play long-term - but it raises a significant near- to mid-term risk to the Occidental dividend, and thus to OXY stock. Weaker oil prices would only add to the pressure.Again, this isn't to say OXY stock is a short. But income investors looking for energy exposure have a better and hedged option in larger Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). At this point, OXY is much more of a speculative play -- and not a stock to be owned just because it's a dividend stock. PetMed Express (PETS)Source: Shutterstock I've long thought online pet retailer PetMed Express (NASDAQ:PETS) was attractive at the right price. But after recent results, the risks are clear, even with PETS offering a 5.5% yield.Chewy.com, now owned by Petsmart, is entering the online pet prescription space in a big way. And it's clearly taking share from PetMed Express. Revenue was flat year-over-year in fiscal Q3 (the December quarter), a notable deceleration from recent performance. In Q4, sales dropped 4% - despite sharply higher advertising spend. Lower sales and higher spending drove EPS down 35% in the quarter - and sets up a difficult fiscal 2020 for the company.  * 5 Big Announcements From Google I/O 2019 PETS may be able to maintain its dividend: the company still has nearly $5 per share in cash on the balance sheet, and no debt. But with sales and margin pressure almost certain to continue into 2020, even a 5%+ payout isn't enough to take the risk that PETS shares will keep falling. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)To be sure, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) might be in the best spot of any stock our list of dividend stocks -- at least on a relative basis. It doesn't have the debt problems of AT&T. Rival Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) is unlikely to take huge amount of market share, even if smaller sparkling water companies and other alternative beverage producers might. Even Coca-Cola's history is better: the stock is a Dividend King, a designation for companies who have raised their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.But dividend aside, KO stock seems a risky play here. It trades at over 21x next year's consensus EPS -- despite the fact that earnings haven't grown for years. Soda consumption is plunging. The $5 billion acquisition of a coffee chain doesn't diversify the $200 billion-plus company enough away from that issue. KO simply looks overvalued, as I argued in March.More broadly, as I noted last year, there's also the fact that a number of stocks similar to KO have taken big hits of late. Branded consumer products stocks like Coca-Cola historically have been attractive, and safe, long-term income plays. (Berkshire Hathaway, of course, has made billions off its stake in the company.)But those 'safe' stocks don't look all that safe anymore. BUD shares tumbled last year, and still haven't recovered their gains. Altria (NYSE:MO) lost a third of its value in less than three months. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is a mess and trades at post-merger lows. Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) doesn't look much better.Tastes are changing. Healthy offerings and independent brands are hot right now -- and that may not change. If it doesn't, KO's earnings are going to stay stagnant at best -- and at some point, investors are going to stop pricing growth into Coca-Cola shares. Western Digital (WDC)Source: Shutterstock Investors spent the second half of 2018 worrying that earnings at chip stocks and memory plays like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) were going to plunge. They've spent the first months of 2019 shrugging now that the earnings declines finally have arrived. WDC's Q3 earnings missed badly, with adjusted EPS of $0.17 missing consensus estimates of $0.46 and declining a stunning 95% year-over-year.The drop in earnings isn't necessarily fatal to the bull case for WDC stock. Memory is a cyclical business due to volatile pricing, and it certainly seems like pricing is closer to a bottom than a top. But I wrote in March, with WDC at similar levels, that investors were underestimating the risks here -- and the Q3 report strengthens that argument.Meanwhile, Western Digital's dividend may be at risk. EPS estimates for FY20 are now under $4 - suggesting a payout ratio climbing above 50%. The company still has over $10 billion in debt that needs to be managed. If expectations for next year keep coming down, Western Digital could choose to cut or eliminate its payout to focus on deleveraging. Analysts at Evercore (NYSE:EVR) made exactly that argument in a note in January -- and it sent Western Digital stock tumbling.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks That Are Bleeding Cash A dividend cut combined with lowered earnings expectations would be something close to a disaster for WDC stock. Given that the dividend stock has bounced over 40% from December lows, it might be time for investors to take profits. Income investors, in particular, may want to look past a yield that now clears 4%. New Media (NEWM)Source: Shutterstock New Media Investment Group (NYSE:NEWM) seems like an intriguing high-yield play. New Media buys local and mid-sized newspapers, presumably on the cheap, and then uses its scale to cut costs and wring out profits. A decent amount of those profits go back to investors, or so it seems: NEWM yields nearly 15% at the moment.But there are several problems with this story -- and one big one for income investors. New Media isn't actually funneling profits to investors. Rather, it's funding the dividend through steady issuance of NEWM stock -- usually at below-market prices. These offerings also involve hefty incentive fees for , New Media's external manager. (Fortress now is owned by Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY).)And so investors aren't really 'earning' a dividend. Rather, their ownership is being diluted for cash. With NEWM stock now at an all-time low, it seems like the market finally is catching on.But even those lows don't look low enough. I called NEWM stock 'toxic' a year ago and still believe that's the case. Unsurprisingly, New Media's revenue and profits keep falling outside of the contribution from acquisitions. The strategy is the same that sent predecessor GateHouse Media into bankruptcy. And the company still is buying yet more papers, instead of using a 'cigar butt' strategy that focuses on returning actual cash to shareholders, not just selling NEWM shares to fund more acquisitions.As such, NEWM looks like a true yield trap. A 15% yield might seem attractive, but it's unlikely to last unless New Media changes its strategy, and its ways.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

2019-05-10,"Concerns about Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) alleged lack of respect for its users' privacy is in the news again.  But Facebook's user base continue to grow and Facebook stock is still on an upward trajectory, indicating that average people don't care about the negative headlines.Source: Shutterstock However, at this point, almost anyone who can get a Facebook page now has one. That means FB's  growth will decelerate unless it either better monetizes its flagship site or generates more revenue from its other websites and apps.  * 7 Cloud Stocks to Buy on Overcast Days  Privacy Concerns Are No Longer Affecting Facebook StockEarlier this week, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg was on Capitol Hill lobbying for new laws to protect Facebook's users in the U.S. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is preparing to fine FB up to $5 billion over its alleged failures to protect users' data during the 2016 election. Lately, there's also been some coverage  of Facebook's decision to ban certain controversial people from the website.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet the vast majority of users don't care about these issues, so FB stock has not been meaningfully affected by them.Amid the controversy, FB remains the go-to platform for keeping tabs on family and friends or spouting off political views. Complaints about banned users have done little to slow FB's growth or negatively affect FB stock. Facebook's Flagship Site Can't Grow That Much MoreThe Facebook platform has attracted 2.38 billion people, a staggering number considering 3.2 billion individuals had internet access as late as 2015.Going forward,  FB will have to rely primarily on Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other lines of business to boost its growth and raise FB stock. Facebook Stock Still Looks Poised to AdvanceBut I think Facebook stock will continue to move higher over the long-term. With its cash hoard of over $45.24 billion as of its last quarterly report. FB can buy a great deal of growth.However, Facebook faces the same challenge  that plagues Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD): How does a company continue growing when it can no longer expand to new markets?Coca-Cola attempted to solve that problem by launching new drinks,   while Facebook has tried to address it with new apps.  Many of FB's acquisitions have performed quite well. Instagram now boasts over 1 billion users. Among young people, Instagram continues to take market share from Snap's (NYSE:SNAP) flagship app.In the realm of international calling, WhatsApp, with its free calls to anywhere in the world, can take business from telcos. Moreover, competition from Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), and other platforms do not pose a direct threat to FB or Facebook stock. Facebook Stock May Have to Follow KO's pathOver the next five years, analysts, on average, forecast that FB's average annual earnings growth rate will be 17.55%. That should support the current price-earnings ratio of Facebook stock, which is just over 28.Still, advertising,  which provides the bulk of Facebook's revenue, is becoming more competitive. Furthermore, if the multiple of Facebook stock moves much higher, FB stock could tumble again.Due to its current size and long-term growth prospects, Facebook stock will gradually become more similar to Coca-Cola stock. Interestingly, KO stock has a similar PE ratio, but KO's profit growth is much lower than that of FB. However, unlike Facebook stock, KO stock pays a dividend. It has a dividend yield of about 3.25%, and its dividend has increased annually for the last 56 years.Facebook should consider a similar approach. If Facebook stock continues to struggle, its current crop of investors will sell their shares. But by attracting dividend investors, FB would entice a group of investors who previously would not consider owning FB stock. The Bottom Line on Facebook StockFacebook may have to adopt  a new approach as its flagship site approaches global saturation levels. Despite privacy concerns and looming fines from countries, people continue to log on to its flagship site and its other apps. Furthermore, the company has  become adept at monetizing its other apps, enabling its profit to grow.However, there is increased competition in the ad space. Moreover, both FB's size and its relatively limited growth prospects put FB in the same position as Coca-Cola. To meaningfully boost FB stock, FB may have to follow KO's lead and initiate a dividend.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-05-15,"On Monday, when the markets were falling off a cliff from fears of the tariff war with China, the headlines were about Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) tumbling ahead of earnings. But on Tuesday, the stock closed up 4.5% into the earnings event. This morning ACB is down 1.2% on the earnings headline, though it dipped lower earlier. Clearly it's an emotional stock, and investors have strong opinions on either side of the ledger.Overnight, ACB reported earnings and Wall Street did not like what they saw. This was the opposite reaction to Tilray's (NASDAQ:TLRY) earnings last night, which was up around 3.5% before falling back to a -3%.The sellers stepped into ACB because they missed on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings were three times worse than forecast but that's not the big problem as this is a growth stock and profits are not too big a concern for now. But they also missed on the revenue forecast. Luckily their sales were four time bigger than last year, they just failed to deliver what investors were expecting.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe bottom line is that traders wanted pizzazz and ACB did not deliver it this quarter. This doesn't change the long term bullish thesis for it. What Now for ACB Stock?While 2019 has been good for stocks as the S&P 500 is up 13%, the year has been great for cannabis stocks. ACB came into the earnings up 36% year to date, for example, and it's not even the star of the sector. Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) and TLRY are up more than double that. Clearly there is froth, but in this case it's not a reason to avoid the stocks. The thesis to own them is not value.Fundamentally the metrics for cannabis stocks do not make sense. ACB sells at a 150 price-to-sales and carries a market capitalization of $8 billion for tiny sales sales. While this sounds like lunacy, this is a budding industry so we don't have yet the right metrics to properly judge the value.  * 10 Retirement Stocks That Won't Wilt in a Bear Market For now, production and deliveries are important to the experts and Aurora kept their 25,000 kilos fourth quarter goal. Think of it as an asset that is in demand and that they can't source enough of it to satisfy the demand. And here the demand is insanely strong.I have rarely seen such excitement over a commodity like cannabis. It is a strong draw regardless of the format. There is tremendous interest in the products but also for the cannabis stocks too. The chat rooms are packed if they are discussing pot stocks. Yes, it's not all about the pot but it's the original draw.Since the cannabis companies stepped on the global platform, the experts started to speculate on applications for the stuff. We already knew about the edibles, but then the potables quickly grabbed the attention of the large corporations that sell sodas and booze. The chatter was that drinkable pot was going to disrupt the recreational beverage markets.The mainstream mega-caps quickly saw the threat, and they, too, are trying to turn it into an opportunity. For example Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) gave $4.5 billion to TLRY and Altria (NYSE:MO) invested similarly in ACB.These capital investment headlines are infectious among corporations and the retail investors. This reminds me of the bitcoin mania of 2017. Hopefully the cannabis sector has more runway than bitcoin. There are similarities, but cannabis has more buy-in from a much larger section of the population. Everyone knows what cannabis is but few can explain what's a crypto-coin.So fundamental metrics aside, you own this stock because you believe that the industry has tremendous growth ahead. The concept behind that is that cannabis companies will disrupt several industries, including the medical community, so the sky is the limit for now.That's why the traditional ways to measure valuation do not apply here. The best recent example of this is Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Investors gave it a pass on valuation for the longest time because of the global growth potential. So as long as it had the opportunity to expand into a massive market they didn't care about how expensive NFLX was.Even though management said that they will be EBITDA positive soon, ACB stock here is in an industry that has the same profitability pass. The potential market for cannabis seems endless, so it's only logical to expect that early movers like Aurora Cannabis will be huge beneficiaries and that it's only a matter of time.So I don't judge and I simply plug my nose and own it. They do have tremendous regulatory headwinds but those will also eventually be a huge part of the incremental opportunities.Technically, there are a few levels to note for the short term. The $8 area has been pivotal for almost two years. These tend to be support on the way down so from here the bulls should have solid footing to target new highs. And in fact, this week's selloff was hard and tested the support and $8 held on the button.Conversely, if the bears eventually manage to break below $8 they could invite momentum sellers to retest $6.80 where they next major level of support lies. This is not a forecast but a scenario unfolding. There are other micro levels but if the thesis is to own ACB stock for the long term then it's futile to waste time dissecting the micro time frames.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-17,"Every so often, Wall Street experiences a craze that is fascinating like Bitcoin in 2017. But now it's the cannabis stocks and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) has been a wild one to watch. It went public last year and within two months it had rallied 1,000%. 2019 has not been kind to TLRY stock as it's down 32% year-to-date, yet it is still up 110% since its inception. Compare that to the S&P 500, which is barely up 2% in a year.Source: Shutterstock Today's write up is to encourage those who like the stock to hold it and to also discourage those who want to short it. For full disclosure, I am not long Tilray nor am I an uber fan or a perma-bull of it.While the IPO was orderly, the period that followed was bonkers. In September it spiked to its $300 all-time high from $93 in three days. Clearly, it was a massive short squeeze where buying begot buying until the equilibrium was restored.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnfortunately for the Tilray stock bulls that was the high mark and it has traded horrendously since then. It is now below $50 and it can't sustain a rally. It's not so much that the fundamentals have deteriorated greatly. It is simply that the stock trade broke from the massive artificial rally. It takes time to restore the natural price action.TLRY still has not grabbed the attention of major corporations. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) got billions from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and Altria (NYSE:MO). Tilray is still going at it alone and it's struggling. It will need better alliances or it risks falling behind.Before you send me hate mail on this, I am not calling TLRY stock dead. Cannabis stocks are a special breed in this early stage. They are trying to establish the industry on Main Street and they may not be able to always impress Wall Street in the short term. There will be ups and downs but the bullish thesis is too diverse in scope to call it dead now.  * 10 Baby Boomer Stocks to Buy So what's a fair value for TLRY stock? There is none because at this point they all carry massive market capitalization but with a tiny fraction of it in sales. TLRY's cap is $6 billion and it recently reported $23 million in sales.To that, management reported a big top line beat and 195% growth year over year. The stock spiked 6% on the headline and it is holding the zone decently given the overall stock market jitters. More importantly, its deliveries doubled year-over-year and that is the focus of many experts. They can't grow into their potential if they cannot deliver it as well as improve their margins along the way.The cannabis industry is still trying to adjust to its new legal status. This is a trend that is spotty for now but will grow its ubiquity with time. The U.S. market is an important one and many states will soon follow the ones that have already legalized it. But on the federal level, it may not be that easy. Luckily there are dozens of other countries for TLRY to potentially serve. Bottom Line on TLRY StockThe hoopla around cannabis stocks like Tilray is that they will disrupt so many huge markets that their upside potential should also be massive. The recreational use is what first comes to mind to most people but there are so many more like medicinal applications, potables and edibles. Maybe one day pot-based drinks will replace some of the soda, wine and beer consumption.  * Top 7 Dow Jones Stocks of 2019 -- So Far Skeptics would call it a craze. Maybe, but unlike bitcoin where the concept escapes 99% of all people, everyone knows what cannabis is and is immediately interested in learning more about it. The allure of it is undeniable as I see evidence of the interest everywhere I go.So the bottom line is that although the experts can dismiss Tilray based on valuation and its distance from its all-time high, they would be making a mistake. Because as big as the potential of this multi-headed future area of business is, it will be impossible to quantify here let alone judge it right. Either avoid it altogether or plug your nose and buy the stock for the long term.We saw the skeptics lose fortunes trying to short Amazon (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Netflix still gets a pass on profitability because of its global expansion potential as should most cannabis stocks … including TLRY stock.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-20,"Warren Buffett is a fan of dividends. Just look at all the dividend stocks that fill Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.B),NYSE:BRK.A) portfolio. Many of his top holdings send plenty of cash flowing back into BRK.B's  coffers,  inflating them by billions of dollars each quarter. And for decades,  BRK.B has been using those dollars to reinvest and drive the future returns of Berkshire Hathaway stock.Source: Shutterstock However, despite Buffett's love of stocks that pay dividends, Berkshire Hathaway stock doesn't pay one of its own,  with Buffett preferring to use the money for other purposes. Over the years, that's been a fine approach. But these days, Buffett and BRK.B may want to rethink that stance.  * 7 High-Yield REITs to Buy (Even When the Market Tanks) A huge cash pile, underperformance in recent years by Berkshire Hathaway stock  and a lack of appealing elephant-sized takeover targets make the idea of paying a dividend- even a one-time special one- worthwhile for Berkshire Hathaway.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A Growing Problem for Berkshire HathawayCalling BRK.B a cash-generating machine would be an understatement. By design, the organization is set up to produce copious amounts of cash flows from its underlying holdings. Its insurance companies pull in billions from their investments, while Buffett receives billions each quarter in dividends from BRK.B's massive stakes in companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). And we can't forget about the dividends/distributions that Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiaries send back to their parent.Historically, Buffett has used this cash primarily to invest in its current businesses, buy new businesses and repurchase Berkshire Hatahaway stock when its shares are cheap enough.The problem is that BRK.B may be producing too much cash these days. At the end of 2018, BRK.B had about $112 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. That balance has only grown as more of its positions have paid their quarterly dividends into the firm's coffers.The issue is that Buffett and Berkshire are having trouble finding ways to spend that cash.With stocks surging over the last year or so, valuations aren't as cheap as Buffett would like. After all, he is a value investor. As a result, it's difficult for Berkshire to buy more shares of companies in which it already has stakes .Meanwhile, expensive valuations make buying companies outright an expensive proposition. Since Berkshire Hathaway is so big, it takes a large deal to really move the needle for Berkshire Hatahawau stock. Unfortunately, Buffett and the team at Berkshire Hathaway recently haven't found any major company that they like. It's been more than three years since BRK.B carried out a substantial buyout. So, its cash keeps piling up.That could explain Buffett's recent bout of underperformance.Over the long haul, Berkshire Hathaway stock has been a great investment. Since Buffett took over, Berkshire Hathaway has managed to produce a compound annual gain of 21% , versus a compound annual gain of just 9.7% for the S&P 500 during that time.However, the last decade  hasn't been so kind for Buffett. BRK.B stock has risen by 259% over the last ten years. That's not bad at all. However, the S&P has returned a total of 314% during that time. This year alone ,the S&P 500 has risen more than twice as rapidly as Berkshire Hatahaway stock. Berkshire Hathaway Should Give It All AwayThere is a relatively easy solution to the problem for Berkshire: enact a dividend of its own. Buffett has notoriously been stubborn on this issue and has said that in 10 or 20 years, the company may decide to institute a dividend. BRK has only paid a dividend once, back in 1967. However,  it might be a good idea for for Berkshire Hathaway stock to start paying one.For one thing, Buffett's argument that it's better to use the money for investments is only valid if he actually puts the cash to work. Handing some of the cash back to investors as a dividend would certainly remove some of the drag on the performance. of Berkshire Hathaway stock.And Buffett wouldn't have to get rid of all of the cash. If Berkshire Hathaway last year- after kicking out the issues with Kraft Heinz (NYSE:KHC) -  put  42% of its profits into dividends, it would have spent about $20 billion on the payouts. In that scenario, Buffett would still have had plenty of cash to play with. In fact, about five years ago, Buffett had only about $42 billion in cash on Berkshire's balance sheet, and he was perfectly content and performed better.By paying a dividend, BRK.B would remove one of Buffett's main complaints about Berkshire Hathaway as well. That is, that Berkshire Hathaway stock constantly trades at a huge discount to book value. If Buffett was to pay an annual dividend or even a one-time large special payout and remove some of the excess cash, the owners of Berkshire Hathaway stock would receive an improved return on their investment. Most likely, they would enjoy higher share prices and higher net asset value. Here's Hoping Berkshire Hathaway Starts Paying UpBuffett is an amazing investor and has steered Berkshire Hathaway towards enviable returns that may have been too good. BRK just throws off too much cash these days. It's a great problem to have, but it is starting to significantly hinder the  performance of BRK.B stock. Initiating a one-time, special dividend or annual payout would go a long way towards removing that excess cash from Berkshire's balance sheet, while improving the performance of BRK.B stock.

2019-05-22,"In early April I wrote about going long Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) stock. That trade paid off quickly but after peaking at $52.50 per share CGC stock gave it back and has reverted to support. While this sounds disappointing it is where the opportunity lies today.Source: Shutterstock It is time to reload almost exactly the same CGC trade as before. I consider this a blend of tactical trade with the potential to making it a long-term investment. It all depends on the investor time frame. The difference will be how to manage the trade if price goes against it. But in either case the start is the same. But First, Canopy Growth FundamentalsThe whole cannabis stock sector is speculative at best. Companies like Canopy Growth are trying to establish a legitimate business on Wall Street for the first time ever. This is not an easy feat and they are facing hurdles.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe regulatory obstacles are also opportunities which eventually will be incremental upside. There is no doubt that the bullish thesis for pot stocks is strong.  * 5 Great Tech ETFs That Aren't the XLK Bottom line, the popularity of pot is what drives the fanatical interest in these stocks.This is not a fad. The interest is too strong to fizzle. Also there is too much action from mega-cap companies who are seeking to join the party if not already there. CGC was ground zero for this when it took $4.5 billion from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). More investments followed like the one into Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) from Altria (NYSE:MO).Also the cannabis story is not local. This is a global phenomena but the markets here in North America are probably the sexiest to investors. Simply stated, the story is too good to dismiss so soon.CGC stock is not for the faint of heart. They are called momentum stocks because they move fast in both directions. Case in point, yesterday it rose 4% on no specific news. So this makes it difficult to find the perfect trading points. So it is best to learn the levels that matter and use those as entry and exit lines. Trading CGC StockOnce CGC fell back into the $43 zone it slowed its deceleration because that is a support zone. These are not hard lines in the sand but rather rubber bands. I can buy it here and expect a bounce towards the last place it failed.If will face resistance at $49 per share so I should lock profits once it reaches it. But this varies based on individual trading preferences and time frames. If it's a tactical trade then I'd set my stop loss below $41.75 or $39.75 per share. Because if those fail, the bears could try to retest $33 per share. This is not a forecast but a scenario that could unfold.The CGC stock fundamentals are the best of the bunch on paper. This is  not to say that they are good. But they did receive the pile of cash from STZ and they are putting it to good use. Their strong balance sheets allows them to execute on plan comfortably. But they still need to grow their delivery capacity.This is what Wall Street believes, and whether reality or not, perception is all that counts this early in the process.Critics of cannabis do make valid arguments. But for every point of contention they offer, there are several other facets of the cannabis that offset that one negative. The applications for cannabis includes not just recreational use, but also medical, CBD, potables, edibles, etc.So according to Wall Street we will smoke it, eat it, drink and rub it on our ailments. So to be a bear on cannabis now is like fighting a multi-headed beast. They can shoot down one aspect of the bullish thesis but there are several more that can still bite the sellers.Nevertheless, it is important to temper the enthusiasm. Canopy Growth fundamentals from the traditional point of view are scary. And it is not alone as the whole sector carries very rich valuation with minimal opposing income. CGC has a market cap of $15 billion and only has a small fraction of it in sales.So yes, they are expensive but the story is not in today's dollar but rather several years out. The legalization trend is just starting. As more states follow the early movers, the North America consumption markets will grow exponentially.Canopy is set to be able to cater to the incremental demand. They are literally forging the trail for the others to follow. Recently we saw them execute an inventive way of acquiring resources without breaking any laws. This is a team that is not afraid to make bold moves and take calculated risks.  * 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Anxious Investors If cannabis stocks are a viable thesis long term, then Canopy Growth is a winner. So far, CGC and ACB are up more than 65% year to date -- four times the performance of the S&P 500.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-05-24,"[Editor's Note: This article was updated to correct the price-to-sales ratio.]Usually I don't like to invest in small-cap companies but New Age Beverages Corporation (NASDAQ:NBEV) is interesting to trade as a speculative bet for the next few months or maybe years.NBEV is a beverage provider, so I consider it as part of the consumer staples group, which includes great companies like Proctor and Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coke (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAlthough it's in the same group as Coke and Pepsi, I do consider NBEV an alternative beverage provider. It's perfectly set up to pursue the cannabis opportunities, specifically the potables.The popularity of cannabis based or infused products has skyrocketed of late and the possibilities are endless. Evidence of this is the popularity of pot stocks like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY). These are intrepid companies trying to establish a new world of opportunities. So this can be a blank canvas for companies like NBEV and and I bet that they will partake in it. Looking at Marijuana Stocks and NBEV StockThe cannabis craze isn't just marijuana stocks -- it now includes CBD products and services. From what I hear, people call it the cure for just about every ailment on the planet. Although there is sarcasm here, I am reporting what I hear even from my friends and family. Everyone who uses it swears it did the trick and that's all that matters.Last year NBEV announced that they will serve potables infused with CBD. So they too will be on the band wagon. This is a trend that is not short term fad. The passion for cannabis from its fans is rare even stronger than Bitcoin. So the movement has legs and evidence is that the major mega cap companies are all rumored to be looking into this too.  * 5 Safe Stocks to Buy This Summer On its own, New Age Beverages stock is not cheap. This is a company that loses money and sells at 5x sales. So clearly Wall Street gives it a lot of leeway for now. They just reported earnings and even though they missed expectations they grew sales 400%. But this stock draws enough shorting interest that I bet it could sport a short squeeze sometime this year.NBEV stock is now far from its high but still is popular among investors. It is still up 212% in a year while the S&P 500 is barely green. A fairer comparison is to the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLP) which is only up 15% for the same period.There is a good chance that NBEV stock entices shorts to bet against extreme moves up or down. So it's a matter of time before it catches fire.Today's thesis is that the overall market weakness we are getting here is an opportunity to bet long on NBEV stock to capture such spike. Once this wave of negative sentiment reverses investors will buy almost every stock up with vigor. But for the controversial stocks like this one they tend to buy them faster.Regardless of the magnitude, the bulls could cause it to breakout above $5.65 per share and that would be a trigger to target $6.70 where it last failed in April. There will be resistance around $6.1 along the way. Above the April fail would bring the sky as the limit.What also makes this possible is that for the last few months, New Age Beverage stock has established a zone of support just below current price. So the bulls have a strong platform from which to mount their efforts.This is not the same as saying that I like the fundamentals; I am agnostic on that front. I consider this a highly speculative and almost binary bet for profit. Since there is less science than hopium, it is important to properly size the gamble. And this is a gamble -- don't bet the farm, choose an amount that won't break your heart or your piggy bank.In addition to the intrinsic risks from the stock itself, I have to contend with the general market malaise from the tariff wars. It seems that the headlines are going to linger for at least another month.Scared markets don't usually buy frothy stocks like New Age. But when investors come to terms with the China risks, then they will buy the riskiest stocks the fastest. In other words, momentum stocks move faster in both directions, so I expect fireworks in NBEV stock soon after the markets stabilize from this tizzy.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

The index rebounded slightly from last Thursday's pullback, and it appears it remained above key support at 2,816.94, which is great news.Last week, amid the volatility, we noticed the relative strength of name-brand retail stocks. Though analysts are concerned about trade wars, tariffs and a potential slowdown of the global economy, it appears U.S. and global consumers are continuing to spend money on their favorite name brands.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWall Street has taken notice, and traders are buying these stocks. We plan to take advantage of this trend by entering a new bullish put write on Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Rolling Out a Profitable PositionWe last recommended selling puts on KO over two weeks ago. President Donald Trump had tweeted about increasing tariffs on Chinese imports, and investors were worried about the state of the market. We thought &quot;conservative bullish stocks&quot; would rise as traders moved out of riskier positions, and it looks like we were right.We kept an eye on KO last week. While the rest of the stock market was struggling, KO climbed up to new short-term highs. Our last trade on KO was the May 17th $48 put write, and we bought it back for a profit before expiration.With traders growing increasingly nervous and cautious after last week's increased volatility, KO will again benefit from investors' move to defensive large-cap stocks. Breaking Above Resistance at $49In our last trade on KO, we mentioned that the stock was seeing some resistance at the $49 level, which served as the top of a longer-term consolidation range.KO recently broke above that down-trending resistance level at $49.  We believe this price level will serve as support for the stock in the near term, and we think $49 strike price might be good for our put write.Daily Chart of Coca-Cola (KO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewWe wouldn't be surprised if KO encounters a little resistance at $50, but ultimately, we are looking for the stock to climb back up to its November 2018 high just below $51.To find out which KO puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

2019-05-29,"Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock, like other Canadian marijuana stocks, raised a lot of cash in 2018 and spawned a lot of hype. Now we will see if that cash can build a sustainable business.Source: Shutterstock Tilray got a slight bump with its recent earnings announcement -- a loss of $30.3 million, 32 cents fully diluted, on revenue of $23 million.The loss was excused by revenue being up 195% from the previous year. Tilray was finally able to do what it came to the market to do -- sell marijuana to willing adults. The company brought in nearly $7.9 million from pot sales, and nearly $5.6 million from edibles, as Canadians started enjoying the drug legally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut this doesn't make Tilray a great investment. We don't yet know what Tilray can be. The Hype Machine for TLRY StockLast year, when Tilray and other marijuana stocks were raising money and selling dreams of pot billions, I called it Bitcoin, in that its value had no relationship to reality.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June The company went public last July with a first trade of $23.05. It was due to open May 29 at about $42.50. This means early investors have doubled their money, but those who bought the hype last fall, just like Bitcoin investors in late 2017, are out of the money.  The stock peaked at $300 but traded over $100 regularly until December.None of this has any relation to market reality. Even if Tilray hits projections of $414 million in sales for all of 2020, you're still paying 10 times book at its current market cap of $4.3 billion.Tilray has also spent the last year supplying itself with sober executives from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Diageo (NYSE:DEO). It also closed a partnership with Novartis (NYSE:NVS) that the Novartis CEO is tired of talking about.The hype machine did its job, but the get-rich-quick crowd has already sold. If you're going to make money in Tilray, it will be from real operations. Tilray and the Pot ShortageCanada, which began allowing some legal cannabis sales late in 2018, has about 37 million people. Compare that to California, which has nearly 40 million. That's a lot of market to supply, and most suppliers have had difficulty. How long the shortage lasts is a subject for debate, with some saying it's already ending.In the short run, Tilray has been focused on supply, and because it had supply it nearly doubled revenue estimates for the first quarter. Now Tilray is looking past the short-term shortage  and seeking to play in as many aspects of legal marijuana as it can.As our Vince Martin writes, Tilray is focusing on branded products -- on oils and edibles, flavorings, additives and drugs. This will let it take advantage of a supply glut whenever that happens, and it's already starting in some markets. The Bottom LineThe fortunes of Tilray balance largely on its controlling shareholder, Privateer Holdings of Seattle (headed by Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy), and its 78% stake. they have said they won't sell any of the stock in the first half of the year.It makes sense for those who got in with pennies on the dollar to get their investment back. But other investors are right to ask whether Privateer is in this for the long term.I think they are. Tilray had over $500 million in cash on its books after a convertible debt offering late last year, enough to fund its strategy shift away from the Canadian smoking market.If you believe in a long-term future for marijuana stocks, Tilray makes sense. Just wait until the stock overhang and the hype both clear before you seek an entry point.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-03,"A lot happened in financial markets in May. One of the more important things that happened was in the bond market. Fixed income yields plunged in May on concerns that the global economy is slowing and will continue to slow as trade tensions between the U.S. and China remain elevated. Specifically, the 10-Year Treasury Yield has dropped below 2.3% in late May, after peaking right around 3.3% in late 2018, and is now at its lowest level since late 2017.One implication of plunging yields is that stocks with big dividend yields become more attractive. Why? Because the lower yields go, the higher dividend yields are relative to those fixed income yields. Thus, when yields plunge, investors tend to flock into dividend stocks with big yields.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Because of this dynamic, plunging yields create a good opportunity to buy into dividend stocks with big yields. Which stocks should be on your list of stocks to buy? Let's take a look at six big dividend stocks to consider as yields plunge.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips AT&T (T)Source: Shutterstock Yield: 6.4%First, we have telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T), a company with an unparalleled yield and enormous financial stability.There are three big reasons to like AT&T here. The first reason is that the stock has a big 6.4% dividend yield, which is nearly triple the yield on a 10-Year Treasury Note and above the yield of most every other notable stock. The second reason is that the company provides telecommunications services with enduring and stable demand, and long-term revenues and profits have significant visibility. And, the third and final reason is that the forthcoming 5G boom in 2019/20 should provide a nice lift to the company's numbers, which should push estimates higher and drive multiple expansion.Thus, with a big yield, healthy stability and strong catalysts, AT&T stock looks like it can and should move higher over the next few months. This is especially true against the backdrop of plunging yields, since that dynamic makes AT&T's 6.4% yield seem that much more attractive. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Robert via FlickrYield: 3.1%In terms of big yield coupled with stability, the cream of the crop in the stock market is utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP).American Electric Power is an electric utility company that delivers electricity and power services to more than 5 million customers across 11 states. Demand for these services is inelastic relative to economic changes -- regardless of the macroeconomic backdrop, consumers will need and pay up for electricity and power services, especially in today's digitally connected world. Consequently, there is largely unparalleld financial stability inherent to the AEP story.But, AEP is much more than just stability. The company has a solid track record of growing revenues and profits through price hikes and market expansion. There's also a 3.1% dividend yield on the stock, too, which is more than 80 basis points above the 10-Year Treasury yield.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Impacted by the Mexican Tariffs All in all, then, if you're looking for a big yield with a lot of stability, AEP is the way to go. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Leo Hidalgo via Flickr (Modified)Yield: 3.2%If you're hunting for yield but don't want to compromise on long-term profit growth, a solid option is beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).Coca-Cola has been on the mountain top of the global beverage market for what seems like forever. That's because this company has found a winning strategy that keeps Coca-Cola the most relevant player in the market. This strategy includes identifying hot and upcoming beverage trends, acquiring the hottest players in that market, and giving those players global distribution. This strategy broadly ensures that Coca-Cola grows with the global beverage industry by capitalizing on every relevant trend.This industry will continue to grow at a healthy low to mid single-digit rate over the next several years. Coca-Cola will grow revenues and profits in line with that rate. Meanwhile, there's a 3.2% yield here, so investors will get slow and steady profit growth on top of a healthy yield.Overall, KO stock looks good here for investors hunting for yield and growth at the same time. Target (TGT)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)Yield: 3.2%The retail sector has been getting hammered recently, but one big retail company that has weathered the storm and has a big yield, too, is Target (NYSE:TGT).To be clear, Target is not mall retail. Mall retailers are getting killed in early 2019 as the entire sector has reported broadly disappointing numbers. But, Target is not a part of that group. Target is an off-mall, off-price, all-in-one retailer with a rapidly growing e-commerce business and rapidly expanding omni-channel presence. Because of this, Target is not being hurt by the e-retail wave. Instead, Target has aligned itself with this trend, and is now firing off decade-best growth numbers.This will persist because Target is just getting the ball rolling on the omni-channel front. Target is still building out delivery and pick-up options everywhere, and as those capabilities expand, Target's growth will remain red hot. Margins will stabilize as wage hike initiatives move into the rear-view mirror. Thus, revenue and profit growth project to be healthy for the foreseeable future.  * 10 Heavily Shorted Stocks to Sell -- Because the Bears Are Right Meanwhile, TGT stock has a 3.2% yield which will help supercharge returns for investors. As such, much like Coca-Cola, Target offers investors a nice mix of yield and growth. International Business Machines (IBM)Source: Shutterstock Yield: 4.9%The technology revolution has seemingly moved past International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), but this company is getting its act together, and the stock has a huge yield and should do well here as yields plunge.IBM doesn't exactly have that growth sparkle that many of its faster growing tech peers do. Even the company's cloud business has stalled out over the past several quarters. But, the company has acquired Red Hat, and in so doing, will add some sparkle into this growth narrative and juice up the growth rates. This extra juice in the growth narrative, coupled with a near 5% yield against the the backdrop of a 2.3% 10-Year Treasury yield, creates a favorable dynamic for IBM stock to head higher from here.To be clear, IBM stock isn't the type of stock you want to buy and hold forever. But, with yields on the comedown and the company's growth rates on the come-up, this stock should do well for the foreseeable future. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Shutterstock Yield: 3.8%Last, but not least, on this dividend stocks to buy list is chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).QCOM stock has been on a roller coaster ride over the past several weeks. First, there was the huge Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) settlement, which caused the stock to soar on the fact that Apple revenue was coming back into the system for the foreseeable future. But, that rally was ultimately short-circuited by a negative FTC ruling, which basically said that Qualcomm's patent licensing practices need to change because they violate antitrust law. QCOM stock dropped big on that news.But, in the big picture, the Qualcomm narrative is improving. The 5G boom is right around the corner, and Apple waving the white flag with Qualcomm basically says that Qualcomm is the only relevant 5G chip supplier. Further, the Apple deal does bring in a bunch of Apple revenue over the next several years. The FTC ruling is a negative, but that story still isn't finished, and the near term, tangible financial impact is relatively muted.  * 5 Stocks Under $10 With Big Upside Potential Consequently, QCOM stock should rebound here, mostly because the fundamentals are improving, but also because the stock's 3.8% yield looks really attractive next to a 2.3% 10-Year Treasury yield.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long T, AEP, TGT and QCOM.

2019-06-04,"Some investors focus on buying stocks whose per-share prices are under $10 or under $5. But when considering stocks to buy, the per-share prices don't fully reflect the actual value that the market is giving companies.In other words, a stock trading at $5 per share could have a total market capitalization of $2 billion, indicating that investors think the company is worth $2 billion. But a stock that's trading at $15 per share could have a market cap of $300 million, meaning that it's actually being valued way below the $5 stock.For that reason, when I'm looking for cheap stocks to buy, I tend to focus on market cap more than per-share price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Big Dividend Stocks to Buy as Yields Plunge Here are three small-cap stocks with exceptionally strong growth prospects. I believe that the market is meaningfully undervaluing these names, making them excellent stocks to buy.   Small-Cap Stocks to Buy: JinkoSolar (JKS)Source: Shutterstock It's hard to believe that the world's top seller of solar panels has a market cap of under $1 billion, but it's true. According to the market, JinkoSolar (NASDAQ:JKS) stock is worth less than $1 billion, even though solar energy is rapidly growing around the world, and despite the fact that it reported that its solar cells in January reached record high efficiency levels, while it has won multiple awards due to the high quality of its modules. Additionally, JKS has signed a huge module supply deal with one of the largest utilities in the world, America's NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). NEE is extremely gung-ho on solar energy.I think it's pretty unusual for a company with a market cap of less than $1 billion to sign a huge deal with a company that's valued at nearly $100 billion (NEE's market cap is $95 billion). Just the NEE deal alone, in combination with the tiny market cap of JKS stock, makes JKS stock a great small-cap stock to buy.Moreover, by most measures, the valuation of JKS stock is ridiculously low. Its forward price-earnings ratio, based on analysts' average 2019 earnings per share estimate, is less than ten, and its price-sales ratio is a tiny 0.1.Those who are bearish on JKS stock tend to hang their hats on two issues: the slowdown of solar growth in Jinko's home market of China and the company's lack of free cash flow. But after dragging its feet on solar-energy policy for a year, Beijing approved almost 15 gigawatts of solar projects, and Reuters recently reported that the country's government will allocate $435 million of subsidies to the sector. Research firm Roth Capital has estimated that the country could install 30 gigawatts of solar energy in the second half of this year, versus 44 gigawatts in all of 2018.If that forecast is even close to accurate, JKS stock will definitely rally going forward.As for the free cash flow issue, the company's free cash flow has been weighed down by the construction of its Florida factory, completed this year. That factory will enable JKS to sell modules to Next Era Energy, and hopefully other major U.S. utilities,  without paying tariffs on them. The company  also plans to  spend $400 million-$450 million to increase its production of premium solar panels in order to meet higher demand for them. JKS' gross margins on those panels are much higher than on the less efficient modules.Clearly, the investments that JKS has made in its Florida factory and in expanding its premium module capacity will be highly profitable for it over the medium-term and the long-term.  In the medium-term, the company's deal with Next Era, greatly increased demand for solar energy around the world, and higher gross margins from its  premium panels will cause its FCF to turn positive, boosting JKS stock.   American SuperconductorSource: Marco Verch via Trending Topics under Creative CommonsAmerican Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) is another company with a small-cap stock (it has a market cap of less than $225 million) and world-class technology and customers. AMSC has sold its Wind Turbine electrical control systems to Inox Wind , which says that it is India's leading wind-energy company and has manufacturing capacity of 1,600 megawatts and three plants. AMSC has won two orders from the U.S. Navy for its highly energy-efficient degaussing system which protects vessels from mines &quot;while reducing the weight of the degaussing system by 90% and reducing energy consumption by more than half that of legacy degaussing systems,&quot; AMSC stated.And in a project partially funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, AMSC in October 2018 announced that Illinois electric utility ComEd would use its high-temperature superconductor technology to strengthen Chicago's electric grid.Finally, in March and April. AMSC announced a total of $20 million in orders for its  D-VAR STATCOM system, which regulate the supply of electricity based on demand and help connect wind power plants to the grid.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Leave in the Vault Going forward, AMSC stock should benefit from the Navy's  plan to add 25 new ships by 2024  and its efforts to shift to all-electric ships. Also likely to help American Superconductor is the growth of wind power around the world. AMSC's prestigious list of customers indicates that its technology is strong, and the company should benefit from its apparently close relationship with the U.S. government. All of these attributes, along with the very low market cap of AMSC stock, make it an excellent small-cap stock to buy. El Pollo LocoSource: Shutterstock El Pollo Loco(NASDAQ:LOCO), a fast-food chain that specializes in Mexican-style grilled chicken, has an opportunity to grab a great niche and benefit from several strong trends. The market cap of LOCO stock is around $400 million.Many, if not most, Kentucky Fried Chicken stores no longer sell grilled chicken, and most smaller restaurants and chains seem to specialize in fried chicken (think Church's and Popeye's). Among chains, only Chick-Fil-A and Boston Market specialize in healthier grilled and/or roasted chicken that's not part of a sandwich, taco or burrito. Boston Market is on the expensive side for fast food, and neither restaurant specializes in highly popular, Mexican-style fare.El Pollo Loco's chicken appears to be healthy, is definitely quite tasty (I've eaten there multiple times) and is rather affordable.  In addition to Mexican-style chicken, it offers Mexican-style side dishes, such as  beans, guacamole and pico de gallo. So El Pollo Loco can fill the apparently otherwise-unoccupied niche of a restaurant that specializes in affordable, Mexican-style, healthy,  chicken that's not served in a sandwich, taco, or burrito.The company's sales have risen meaningfully every year, and its gross income has also been on an upward trend, reaching $78.6 million last year. However, a large increase in its sales, general and administrative expenses hurt its profitability last year.The company's SG&A likely rose partly because it's looking to intensify its marketing efforts, in order to become more widely known in the U.S.  That makes sense, since it only owns and franchises less than 500 restaurants in six states, with 80% of its restaurants located in California.In Q1, the company's EPS, excluding some items, came in at 15 cents, and its comparable restaurant sales increased 2.4% YoY. while its revenue climbed 3% YoY.LOCO said that its comp sales increase was driven by a 4.6% increase in the average check as it hiked its prices by 3%. However, the company indicated that its traffic fell amid bad weather in California.Importantly for LOCO stock, the company is taking action on several fronts in an effort to communicate its value proposition and increase its traffic. The company launched a new ad campaign in March, including intensified TV ads, and hired Brian Wallunas as its new VP, Digital Marketing. Wallunas previously was Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) Director of Marketing Technology, indicating that he is a tech marketing whiz who will be able to greatly improve the company's loyalty, digital and social media efforts.I believe that with these steps, El Pollo Loco will be able to communicate and widely disseminate its unique value proposition, thereby dramatically increasing its traffic and results  and greatly boosting LOCO stock. Therefore, El Pollo Loco is a very good small-cap stock to buy.As of this writing, the author owned shares of JKS and AMSC.

It looks like the United States new tariffs on goods from Mexico won't sink the stock market just yet.The S&P 500 is holding nicely above support at ~2,738 -- the level that served as resistance in early February and then as support in early March.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is a positive sign for undervalued stocks on Wall Street. When the market pulls back and then bounces up off support, like we've seen the S&P 500 do during the past few weeks, traders look around to see if any stocks appear to be undervalued. In other words, traders usually go bargain hunting after pullbacks.Target (NYSE:TGT) looks like a real bargain right now, and we want to sell puts on it. Better-Than-Expected Earnings From a RetailerTGT recently reported better-than-expected numbers for the first quarter of 2019. The company beat revenue estimates by $140 million and earnings estimates by $0.09 per share -- reporting results of $17.63 billion and $1.53 per share, respectively.Management also affirmed its full-year earnings guidance of $5.75-$6.05 per share. This signals that management isn't worried about increased tariffs digging too deeply into the company's margins.Also, TGT has done an excellent job taking advantage of the increase in consumer spending in the United States. The company increased its comparable-store sales by 4.8% last quarter and boosted its online sales by 42%. Breaking Above Down-Trending ResistanceThe positive earnings news initially sent TGT soaring higher, where it encountered and consolidated below its down-trending resistance level. It has been interacting with this resistance since it reached its 52-week high on September 10, 2018. However, the stock broke through that level yesterday.Daily Chart of Target Corporation (TGT) -- Chart Source: TradingViewWe agree with the analysts at JPMorgan who stated, &quot;We believe the shares are undervalued and we see potential upside to consensus.&quot; These same analysts have given TGT a longer-term price target of $100.This is a perfect opportunity to sell puts on TGT. And we don't need the stock to climb to $100 per share to collect a profit potential on a put write.

Otherwise, this one may be a no-touch until it can prove itself in one direction or another. Over the 20-day moving average puts $20 on the table. Below $18 puts the $17 lows on watch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 2: Shopify  Click to EnlargeInvestors who like playing chicken with an oncoming train must love trading Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) from the short side. As much as I wanted to talk about Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) as it bursts over $100, this one deserves a look too.Keep it simple: Shopify continues to holds its 20-day moving average and uptrend support. It burst over $280 resistance and short of a market-wide correction, has its eyes set on $300+. Below $280 puts the 20-day/uptrend support on watch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 3: Coca-Cola  Click to EnlargeWhat a breakout we have in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) on Wednesday! Shares burst over $50 after a series of higher lows over the last three months.Keep this one simple too. Stay long over $50 and consider buying on a retest. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 4: Micron  Click to EnlargeNegative news has Micron (NASDAQ:MU) slipping about 4% on Wednesday. Shares opened near the 20-day and were instantly batted down. Sometimes the news and the technicals line up a little too good.Shares are still over short-term downtrend resistance (purple line), but below $34. The stock spent the last week or two consolidating between $32.50 and $34. Is it a compelling investment right now? Maybe. But below the former level ($32.50) and I'd look out in MU. It could bring up lower prices in a hurry. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow 5: Ambarella  Click to EnlargeIt sure was nice to see Ambarella (NYSE:AMBA) jump out of that bullish consolidation area between $37 and $39. But how discouraging is it to see it give up all of its post-earnings gains on Wednesday?We can't trust a move like this, especially given the type of market we're in right now. If AMBA can reclaim $40, perhaps it can give its 20-day moving average another run. Above that mark puts Wednesday's highs back on the table.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Below $39, and $37 short-term range support is back on the table.

The May ISM report checked in at 56.9, up from 55.4 in April and above the average reading this year of 57.As has been noted here in recent days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index, meaning the stocks with the largest price tags command the largest weights in the benchmark and it is those names that often capture many of the headlines. However, the blue-chip index got some support Wednesday from some its mid-level members as several stocks outside the Dow's top 10 holdings were among the index's top percentage gainers today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sourcing Wednesday LeadershipCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was one of the Dow leaders today, jumping 1.56% a day after Morgan Stanley reiterated an &quot;overweight&quot; rating and $55 price target on shares of the world's largest soft drink maker. Morgan Stanley is more enthusiastic about Coca-Cola than it is about rival Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:DPS).  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Coca-Cola is a member of the defensive consumer staples. Indicating that investors may not yet fully trust the two-day rebound in stocks following the market's May doldrums, two of the Dow's other marquee consumer staples names -- Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) -- joined Coca-Cola among the index's top four percentage gainers Wednesday.Shares of Walmart, the largest U.S. retail store, climbed 1.8% even after CEO Doug McMillon said at the company's investor meeting that the U.S. government needs to raise the minimum wage and that the current minimum hourly rate of $7.25 is too low.Procter & Gamble added 1.96% after the Ohio-based company said it will test environmentally friendly pod refills of Olay Regenerist Whip later this year. There was probably more to P&G's Wednesday than that announcement, with the &quot;more&quot; being investors favoring defensive names.Boeing (NYSE:BA), the largest Dow stock, gained 1.23% on reports the company is in talks with unidentified Chinese airlines to possibly deliver an order for about 100 of its wide-body 787 Dreamliners and 777X passenger jets. The deal could be worth $30 billion.Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), the Dow's tenth-largest member, gained 0.81% after Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger reiterated a &quot;market perform&quot; rating and $133 price target on the stock. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThree trading days into June, a historically rough month for stocks, and the Dow has traded higher twice. That is some of the good news. But there are some potentially concerning areas, including the ADP private payroll for May. That report showed the addition of just 27,000 private sector jobs last month, well below economists' forecast of 185,000 new jobs.&quot;The reality is job growth is slowing, notably slowing, but in the scheme of things, it's still strong,&quot; said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.As Wednesday's price action suggests, stocks can absorb one disappointing data point and climb higher, but with trade wars still raging, equity markets cannot afford a spate of lethargic economic data.As of this writing, Todd Shribed did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-06,"May was a red month for global equities as escalating trade tensions and the worry of slowing economic growth pushed investors to sell risky assets and pile into the bond market. As a result, stocks fell sharply in May, while bonds rallied.But while the May market selloff was broad, it didn't take down every single stock in the market. Instead, there were a handful of stocks which actually rallied in May and recorded new all-time highs while the market was plunging.What was so special about this group of stocks? For one reason or another, these stocks just didn't and still don't care about tariffs. Some of these stocks are defensive in nature, so they rallied as investors tried to play defense. Others don't have much exposure to the trade war. And some of these stocks are supported by businesses with more than enough growth momentum to offset any trade-related weakness.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBroadly, these stocks ignored rising trade conflicts and marched higher.They will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As such, as global trade conflicts stick around over the next few months, the smart move is to pile into the stocks which can head higher even against that dour backdrop.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Which stocks are those? Let's take a deeper look at 7 stocks to buy that don't care about tariffs. Okta (OKTA)Investment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 17%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: You want to buy hyper-growth cloud company Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) here because this is a secular growth stock with a robust growth narrative that simultaneously isn't slowing, lacks exposure to trade headwinds, and could actually benefit from a domestic economic slowdown.In a nutshell, Okta provides identity-based cloud security solutions for enterprises. This growth narrative is on fire right now (Okta reported 50%-plus revenue growth last quarter), and won't slow anytime soon. There are no trade headwinds here since Okta is a service business, and services have been exempt from trade talk thus far. Further, security spend is one thing that probably won't get hit in an economic slowdown, so this company's business model is fairly resilient to economic slowing.Overall, then, Okta is a red hot growth stock to buy now as it should remain red hot for the foreseeable future. American Electric Power (AEP)Source: Robert via FlickrInvestment Style: Defensive% Gain Since May 1: 5%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: With respect to utility giant American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP), AEP stock looks good here because this company is as stable as it gets, is relatively resilient to an economic slowdown, and lacks exposure to anything trade-related, while the stock's yield is big and increasingly attractive as fixed-income yields plunge.When it comes to operational stability, American Electric Power is second to none. The company provides electric services to U.S. consumers. Demand for those services will not wane anytime soon. Further, trade is a non-issue here, and the stock has a nice big 3% dividend yield, which is presently as far above the 10-Year Treasury yield as it has been since late 2017.  * 7 Ways to Make Berkshire Hathaway Stock More Attractive Overall, AEP stock is a stable stock with a big yield, and as such, is a high quality defensive stock to buy in today's volatile market. Dollar General (DG)Source: Shutterstock Investment Style: Defensive & Stable% Gain Since May 1: 5%At All Time High? YesBull Thesis: You want to buy off-price retail giant Dollar General (NYSE:DG) here because the company is firing on all cylinders today and should continue to fire on all cylinders for the foreseeable future -- even if the U.S. economy slows meaningfully.Retail had a rough start to 2019. The consumer weakened in the first quarter of 2019, and retailers felt that weakening. Across the sector, retailers put up ugly first quarter 2019 numbers. Not Dollar General. The dollar store giant's first quarter numbers were really good. Why the discrepancy? Because although the consumer may have weakened in early 2019, the off-price retail strategy still worked, mostly because the consumer's affinity for lower prices doesn't go lower when times get tough.If anything, it goes up. As such, with economic turbulence on the horizon, Dollar General has visibility to gain share and traffic over the next few quarters. That makes DG stock a solid buy here. Coupa (COUP)Investment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 14%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: Hyper-growth cloud company Coupa (NASDAQ:COUP) looks good here because this company is firing on all cylinders right now with a solution that could become increasingly attractive in an economic slowdown and in a market supported by secular growth tailwinds which won't let up anytime soon.Coupa offers a cloud-based enterprise solution which is broadly aimed at helping companies become more efficient with their spend. Enterprises really like the Coupa solution. That's why this company has reported 30%-plus revenue growth for the past several quarters. Demand won't falter because of a slowing economy. If anything, a slowing economy will push demand higher since companies will increasingly want to optimize spend when dollars become more scarce.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% As such, this is a hyper-growth cloud company that should remain on a healthy growth trajectory for the foreseeable future. That makes COUP stock a good buy here. Coca-Cola (KO)Source:  Chris Nielsen via FlickrInvestment Style: Defensive% Gain Since May 1: 5%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: When it comes to beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), you buy KO stock here for largely unparalleled defense to a global economic slowdown on top of a big yield which is becoming increasingly attractive as yields elsewhere plunge.Consumers need to drink. Regardless of the economic backdrop -- super fast growth, super slow growth, or something in the middle -- consumers across the globe need to drink. Coca-Cola is the heartbeat of the global beverage industry. As such, regardless of how the global economy develops over the next several quarters, Coca-Cola's numbers should remain largely stable and resilient to any slowdown. At the same time, KO stock has a juicy 3% dividend yield which is as far above the 10-Year Treasury Yield as it's been since mid-2017.Thus, in the big picture, Coca-Cola is a big and stable company with a big and stable yield. That combination makes KO stock a strong defensive stock to buy in volatile times. Shopify (SHOP)Source: Shopify via FlickrInvestment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 19%At All-Time High? YesBull Thesis: E-commerce solutions provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is on fire right now, and you want to buy SHOP stock here because this fire won't die anytime soon, regardless of how the economic currents change.Shopify is enabling an entire new generation of individual and small-to-medium sized retailers to compete in the direct retail channel with the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This growth narrative has caught fire over the past few quarters as the e-retail market has become increasingly decentralized. This fire won't die anytime soon. The secular growth narrative of Shopify pioneering a new era of decentralized direct retail is simply too powerful to be weighed down by tariffs. That's why this company reported 50% gross merchandise sales growth last quarter in the face of tariffs.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far So long as this secular growth narrative maintains robust momentum, SHOP stock will continue to march higher. Roku (ROKU)Source: Shutterstock Investment Style: Secular Growth% Gain Since May 1: 60%At All Time High? YesBull Thesis: You want to buy OTT video platform Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) here because the company's secular growth narrative is powerful enough to offset slowing economic growth headwinds, and such headwinds could actually provide a lift to the company's user growth.The big idea at Roku is that this company is becoming the cable box of the OTT video world. That world is rapidly growing, and it won't stop growing because of an economic slowdown. If anything, growth will be supercharged by a slowdown. Consumers will finally be moved to cut expensive cable packages in bulk, and pivot towards much cheaper streaming options. Thus, the Roku growth narrative is not jut red hot right now, but could actually get even hotter if the economy slows.Because of this, Roku stock looks good here. You have a stock that's firing on all cylinders without any material headwinds on the horizon.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long OKTA, AEP, DG, SHOP, WMT, AMZN, and ROKU.

2019-06-07,"If you're a contrarian in the cannabis space, you're likely very intrigued with New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV). Not only is the underlying plant one of the hottest commodities in the market, cannabis is going mainstream. A particularly attractive subsegment is cannabidiol or CBD-infused drinks. With New Age Beverages specializing in this sector, NBEV stock immediately catches the eye.Others have embraced the idea of CBD beverages. Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Hexo (NYSEAMERICAN:HEXO) have secured deals with big-time beverage makers. But as InvestorPlace feature writer James Brumley noted, NBEV was the first to hit the market. Almost always, that's better than being the first to have the idea. And with the competition lollygagging, NBEV launched the Marley brand last fall.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSubsequently, NBEV stock soared from $1.53 to just under $10. That paradigm shift occurred over a matter of days.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far But Brumley is cautious on the longer-term outlook for New Age Beverages stock, and for good reason. Management recently forked over some funds and possibly resources to acquire healthy-products maker Brands Within Reach. Supposedly, it's an &quot;incredible deal.&quot; But to Brumley's point, we just don't know the specifics.That immediately raises suspicion. More critically, though, CBD-infused drinks are currently a tough sell. Although the concept is appealing, the retail market itself is filled to the brim with competitors. Plus, the market size is very modest.Investing heavily into this segment will seemingly yield very little reward. As such, investors took their profits and dumped NBEV stock after the announcement, with shares down 15% in the days since the June 3 announcement. To compare, the cannabis-focused ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEArca:MJ) is little changed while the beverage-heavy First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (NYSEArca:FXG) is up almost 5% in the last few days. NBEV Stock is Fundamentally Stretched WideIn my view, New Age Beverages stock is an awkward play. Despite some obvious challenges, I believe in CBD-infused drinks for the long term.For one thing, the cat's out of the bag politically. In an unusually vitriolic time, both Republicans and Democrats have found surprising consensus in marijuana-related issues. While the federal government still classifies weed as a Schedule I drug, economic tensions also help the green sector in eventually overturning this classification.After all, President Trump can't keep playing hardball with China and Mexico without incurring domestic pain. And that translates into angry voters come 2020.Second, CBD specifically levers compelling evidence for medicinal effectiveness. Sure, medical doctors downplay this evidence because prescribing plants isn't exactly super-profitable. But they can't deny that many patients reported benefits with consuming CBD.Therefore, I'm willing to extend patience to names like Canopy Growth or Hexo. But NBEV stock? That's a tough one. If NBEV simply concentrated on cannabis-related products, I believe the investor community would give them considerable leeway. Cannabis is an unprecedented market, so it makes sense that it receives unprecedented flexibility.But NBEV stock isn't just a CBD competitor. Its acquisition of Brands Within Reach, which includes brands like Nestea and Evian, provides the proof. Instead, New Age Beverages seeks to dominate the broader healthy beverages market.In other words, NBEV has very normal ambitions. Because of that, investors will have normal expectations.One of those expectations is margins: prospective stakeholders will seek outsized profitability metrics. If you look at established beverage-makers like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP), or Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), they all feature strong margins.As a rule of thumb, beverage-makers should have on average higher margins than food companies. However, NBEV lags significantly in this department. No Outstanding Catalyst for NBEVAnother headwind I anticipate is that no outstanding catalyst bolsters the case for NBEV stock. I'm more convinced about this now after having looked at their website.Like any beverage company, NBEV has their core brands displayed front and center. The problem is, I'm not inspired by any of it. Nor have I heard of any of the brands they carry (outside their recent acquisition).  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Of course, my anecdotal observation isn't the end all, be all of anything. But I do a considerable amount of grocery shopping. Plus, I'm in the market for healthy beverages. If I can't recognize at least one of these brands, you gotta figure New Age Beverages stock has an uphill battle to climb.And this segues into my final point: I think NBEV stock has a credibility problem. They're competing in a very broad and saturated market. I'm not sure if they have the resources to withstand choppy waters that are surely coming.Although I like the CBD angle that New Age carries, I think there's too many questions. It might work out as a trade, but I'll be watching from the sidelines.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This, and automating protection under Europe's General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), helps keep Twilio from becoming a commodity product. Bulls are also betting Lawson can keep spotting good acquisitions like Sendgrid, an e-mail platform purchased last year for $2 billion.Bulls can also point to institutional confidence in Twilio. Institutions now own more than 50% of the common. These investors can usually distinguish between short-term success and sustainability. The Bear Case for TwilioThe bear case starts with the fact that voice, text and e-mail are commodity services, and that this market is shrinking as data calls replace voice calls.Speculators are already seeking options protection for their long positions, concerned that growth has to slow as the market is absorbed.Our James Brumley is among those who insist the company's growth can't be sustained. He writes both start-ups and giant companies like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) can incorporate Twilio's concepts in their apps, and that scale isn't yet leading to profit.This is what I mean about landing the rocket ship. Many companies grow quickly only to falter when it comes time to turn revenue into profit. Securing apps is becoming an increasingly vicious game. The Android operating system of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google unit was recently infested with adware that can wreck phones, through what had been a reputable app provider.But competing with bad guys is competing. If Twilio can continue to secure its services, real profit becomes possible. The Bottom LineInvestors who have ridden the Twilio rocket ship to this point are right to try to lock in their profits and seek protection, if only because large numbers are harder to grow than smaller ones. With a market cap approaching $20 billion on trailing year sales of $650 million, Twilio is more than fully valued.But I wouldn't hit the panic button just because antitrust officials are going after the Cloud Czars upon whose success apps like Twilio depends. Get your money out, seek protection but know that a hard fall may become a buying opportunity.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-10,Sector ETF report for FSTA,Should You Invest in the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (FSTA)?
2019-06-10,"That's four big daily wins in a row for stocks, with the S&P 500's gain of 1.05% on Friday. It's still too soon to call it the beginning of a recovery move; it's almost too much, too fast. But, it buys time for the bulls to regroup.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) carried more than its fair share of the weight, rallying 2.8% to cross back above the $1 trillion market cap mark. Weighing the market down was the 1.26% tumble from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), setting the tone that adversely impacted most other banking names. Concerns of interest rate cuts rattled bank investors, as lower interest rates threaten bank profits.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy Under $10 Neither are especially compelling trading prospects headed into this week's trading action though. Rather, take a look at stock charts of McKesson (NYSE:MCK), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP). Here's why, and what needs to happen next.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips CenterPoint Energy (CNP)When we last looked at CenterPoint Energy back on May 15, it had just pushed up and off of its 200-day moving average line, only to run into resistance again. While it could have gone either way at the time, the bears actually had the edge.Since then, the 200-day line failed to keep the stock propped up. Sure, CNP snapped back in early June to cross back above the very same 200-day moving average line. With the shape and placement of Friday's bar, however, it appears CenterPoint shares are back en route to even lower lows.  Click to Enlarge  * The red flag is Friday's engulfing pattern, meaning the high open and low close completely engulfed Thursday's low/high range. Such a sweeping change of heart is telling.  * Simultaneously, the big bearish swing also dragged CNP back below the pivotal 200-day line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * If the selling gets traction, the next likely landing spot is just under $27, where CNP found support for the better part of last year. Coca-Cola (KO)With nothing more than a quick glance, Coca-Cola looks enticing. Shares have been rallying quite well since February's low, seemingly unstoppable. The fact that a long-term resistance line, plotted in white on the weekly chart, was hurdled last week only bolsters the bullish argument.A closer, more thorough look at the weekly chart, however, reveals the advance just bumped into another rather well-established ceiling. Meanwhile, the shape of Friday's bar also suggests we're ready to pivot back into a pullback.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets   Click to Enlarge  * Friday's high aligns with the prior two major peaks from KO stock, plotted in red on the weekly chart that's also on the verge of an overbought RSI indicator.  * In the daily timeframe, the open and close both near the low of a relatively tall bar, which also suggests a move from a net-buying to a net-selling environment.  * While the stage is set, the move won't be complete until we get a confirmation in the form of a lower close. McKesson (MCK)Finally, given its multi-year history, doubting McKesson is on the mend now wouldn't be a tough conclusion to make. And, that may well be the case here despite a couple of bullish curiosities. Nevertheless, those curiosities are worth pointing out, as a recovery effort from here could lead into a major rally effort.  Click to Enlarge  * Most noteworthy is also the least noticed … not only are we now seeing a bullish MACD convergence, the most recent MACD crossover took place above the prior one. It points to a longer-term advance that needs multiple efforts to get going.  * At the same time, notice on the daily chart that all the key moving average lines are about to converge after last year's divergence. The big clue to watch for is the purple 50-day average crossing above the white 200-day line. That's a &quot;golden cross&quot; that suggests more bullishness ahead.  * The ultimate ceiling, however, is currently at $135. That's the line that connects all the major peaks since September, marked in yellow on both stock charts.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-06-13,"The long-term prospects for Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) stock look good. That is, if you ask CRON stock fans. There is almost no convincing them otherwise. Critics of Cronos Group stock and the whole industry can offer smartest arguments to prove that the cannabis stocks are headed for disaster, but it will all fall on deaf ears.Source: Shutterstock The bullish thesis for the industry is so vague and the scope is so widespread that it's almost impossible to kill it this year. It is a multi-headed beast where if the bears chop off one head, many others will stare them down with sharp teeth.Don't take my word for it, just consider the scoreboard. CRON is up 64% year-to-date -- leading the pot stock pack. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ) is up only 30%. And I say this while I chuckle because that's still double the S&P 500 performance for the same period. So CRON is up four times more than the S&P.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 6 Growth Stocks That Could Be the Next Big Thing This is similar to how it was for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in their infancy stages. This is also very similar to the current situation with Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and even Uber (NYSE:UBER). The bullish thesis for these types of pioneer stocks is too vague to try too short this early.This is not the same as saying that I drank the Kool-Aid think pot stocks will be as successful as AMZN long term. I am merely saying that it's too early to short them. Trading CRON StockSo do I go all in on CRON? No, but still this all depends on individual time frames and risk appetites. One thing is for sure, pot stocks make for great short-term trading vehicles so CRON has opportunities on both the upside and downside. Those who believe in it long term, this is as good as any to buy at least half their position. It is futile to wait for a perfect sign to enter.Mid term, I favor the upside potential through the rest of the year for CRON stock because it established a solid band of support. Since January of 2018, $14 per share played an important role. It served as a major pivot point, so it is an area where bulls and bears are consistently eager to fight it out hard.This creates congestion so it becomes a sticky zone. And since CRON stock price is above it, the bulls can use it as solid footing. Meaning onus is on the bears to break that. Otherwise, every dip towards it is a buying opportunity. Sustaining the selling then becomes almost impossible.So this leaves us with evaluating the upside potential at hand. Earlier I mentioned that there are shorter- term time frames to trade. Above $18 per share, CRON will invite momentum buyers to launch a $4 rally from there. There will be resistance near $20. This sounds like a wild statement, but it is doable for such a momentum stock.I also noted that the $14 per share zone is a long term pivot, but so is $16. Specifically for this year, it served as a major point of contention. So I expect $16 to be the immediate support. For those who like to sell credit put spreads to generate income, that would be a good short-term level to consider.Conversely, there is risk below especially due to trade uncertainties. So we are vulnerable to geopolitical headlines to cause sporadic selloffs. If Cronos stock fills the gap below and falls below $13.5 per share, it could trigger a $2 overshoot. While this is not my forecast, it is a scenario that exist below. The Bottom Line on Pot StocksIt is also important to note that I am not a super fan of the whole cannabis sector. But I do recognize that it's a tough short.This is a brand new industry to Wall Street, and marijuana still illegal at the federal level in the U.S. So it has everything going against it. Yet pot stocks still have so much support from everyone from retail investors to mega corporations. Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and Altria (NYSE:MO) were the first two to dip their toes in the water by throwing billions at Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and CRON so we know that they are the best leading cannabis companies.This is just the beginning.Dozens more companies are waiting and trying to figure out how they can also grab a piece of this pie. We all know about the popularity of recreational pot. But there are the slew of other applications that are extremely interesting. Mainly medicinal, edibles, and portables. There is a strong consensus that people will be drinking pot-infused drinks instead of soda, beer or wine.  * 7 High-Quality Cheap Stocks to Buy With $10 I am not here to judge whether this is a realistic goal; it's definitely not in the very near term, but it's not out of the realm of possibilities. So the theoretical addressable market is literally incalculable. So what are the bears shorting?

2019-06-17,"In a frothy market you can get a mighty high multiple if you're in the right niche. Like marijuana. That's the story of New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV). NBEV stock tripled last September after announcing a drink containing CBD.  Its drinks even have a picture of the late Bob Marley on them.But pot isn't NBEV's real business. Canned beverages are its business. Things like coffee, tea and kombucha. Sodas with strange combinations like watermelon and coconut, the kind of stuff you'll try at a soda ranch on Route 66.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince that September explosion, where it briefly traded at almost $9, NBEV stock has lost its fizz, settling into a trading range of between $4-6 per share. But its market cap, $350 million, remains impressive for a drinks company with March quarter sales of $58 million, and no profit.But still. Pot! What NBEV Is Up ToNew Age Beverages has used its moment in the pot limelight to bulk up the product line. The highlight was this month's purchase of Brands Within Reach, for $6.4 million, only $500,000 of it cash.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today Brands Within Reach has brand licensing and distribution rights for some mainstream beverages, like cold Nestea and Illy coffee. The idea is that this gets New Age in the door at mainstream retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), which then might look at its more esoteric brands.This came just six months after buying Morinda Holdings, another small company but with distribution in 60 countries.  The idea there was to expand the market for its CBD products.The Morinda combination is already in the numbers due to be reported August 8, where sales of $70.8 million are expected. Following on the first quarter take of $58 million, that's good growth and, if the pattern persists through the year, it could lead to sales equaling the stock's current market cap by this time next year.That's important, because New Beverage CEO Brent Willis knows he's in the drinks business, not the pot business. He promised to focus on execution after buying Morinda, but the chance to buy into serious beverages with just stock was too good to pass up. What Next for NBEV Stock?Some analysts got very bullish on New Age after the Morinda buy, predicting imminent profits and a steady rise to $9 per share, which would be double its current level.InvestorPlace's Josh Enomoto disagrees. He sees the Brands Within Reach acquisition as a turn away from CBD, the source of its frothy valuation. He also sees the current brands as nothing special.Personally, I like the Brands Within Reach deal. NBEV now has both brands that can get it into the door of big retailers and global distribution for its CBD products. But drinks remain a risky business, a land of giants in which NBEV is a mouse. If Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Pepsico (NYSE:PEP) or even Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) decided there was something to this CBD thing, they could blow NBEV out of the water quickly. The Bottom Line on NBEV StockI think the owners of Brands Within Reach know all this, so there's an overhang of almost $6 million in stock, itching to be sold right now.Much of the rest of the common stock is held by speculators looking for a quick payout. Institutions hold just over 13% of the common, against almost 26% held by insiders.  I think they will bail, too, at the first sign of bad news.  * 7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Invest In Today In other words, NBEV stock has a sell-by date, and execution alone won't stave it off.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-06-17,"When folks think of the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) portfolio and its collection of holdings, most of which were selected by Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, the companies that most readily come to mind are probably American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and, more recently, Apple (AAPL).But a deep dive into Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings reveals a more complicated picture.Berkshire Hathaway held positions in 48 separate stocks as of March 31, according to regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the portfolio of &quot;Buffett stocks&quot; isn't as diversified as the number might suggest. In some cases, BRK.B holds more than one share class in the same company. Some holdings are so small as to be immaterial leftovers from earlier bets the Oracle of Omaha has yet to completely exit.And perhaps most importantly, Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio is actually pretty concentrated. The top six holdings account for almost 70% of the portfolio's total value. The top 10 positions comprise nearly 80%. Banks and airlines, to cite a couple of sectors, carry quite a load in this portfolio. Then there's the fact that several Buffett stocks actually were picked by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Here, we examine each and every holding to give investors a better understanding of the entire Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.

2019-06-20,The Coca-Cola Company today announced it will release second quarter 2019 financial results on July 23 before the New York Stock Exchange opens.

2019-06-20,"Shares of Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) are climbing on optimism that its deal for Acreage Holdings (OTCMKTS:ACRGF) will go through. On Wednesday the deal received CGC stock shareholder approval, just leaving regulators on the table for a potential headwind. We also have this afternoon's earnings to get through.Source: Shutterstock By and large, the deal is expected to go through, particularly given some of the board members involved. Acreage board members include former Republican Congressman and Speaker of the United States House John Boehner and Brian Mulroney, the former Conservative Prime Minister of Canada -- among others.Many expect the $3.4 billion cash and stock deal to go through, leaving Canopy with a big asset for future growth here in the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhen investors think of blue-chip stocks, Canopy won't be the first that comes to mind. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and others are what investors think of, but that doesn't matter. CGC stock has quickly proven that it's the best of the best when it comes to cannabis investments. Canopy Growth Is a Blue Chip StockAfter Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested some $4 billion into the company, it loaded CGC's bank account. But the deal gave Canopy a lot more than a good reputation. Suddenly, it had a powerful balance sheet as a major asset. It could afford to enter new markets, gobble up high-growth companies and essentially lead the land-grab charge as cannabis gains momentum. Further yet, it had a high-quality and reputable company staking big-time money on Canopy's leadership. That gives the company some clout.  * Check Out These 5 Fast-Growing Stocks to Buy Today If Constellation trusts Canopy with $4+ billion, why shouldn't I? That's what a lot of investors and other companies found themselves asking.CGC stock has built a foundation in Canada and is working on global expansion in Europe and Australia, while its Acreage Holdings deal positions itself for the coming landslide in the U.S. While its valuation doesn't quite reflect its current fundamentals, investors are betting on its long-term potential.In essence, they are betting that CGC will become the PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP)  or Coca-Cola of its industry. That's not to say New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV), Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) or Cronos Group (NYSE:CRON) won't be winners either. Just that CGC is becoming the 800-lb gorilla of the group.From the most recent earnings release:&quot;Our successful first full quarter with recreational sales in Canada reinforces our long held strategy of making meaningful investments early in order to secure market share,&quot; said Bruce Linton, Chairman & Co-CEO, Canopy Growth. &quot;With a strong cash position, we added strategic assets and IP through acquisitions to accelerate the sophistication of our inputs with ebbu, and our consumer-facing outputs with Storz and Bickel.&quot; Trading CGC Stock  Click to EnlargeCGC stock is now pushing through its 20-day and 200-day moving averages. If it can continue to push higher, its 50-day moving average near $44.50 is in sight. This stock has been volatile, but continues to very slowly push out new highs.Unfortunately, those new highs are often met with a wave of selling. For instance, after hitting $52 in February, Canopy Growth stock quickly retreated, falling to sub-$42 -- a 19% drop -- in just six trading sessions. It traded sideways for a while after that, before eventually pushing up through $52. A month later, shares were at $38.38. The peak to trough decline was more than 27% that time.So what can we expect on this go around? Much of it will depend on earnings, set for after the close on June 20th.I'm looking to see if CGC stock price can again climb back to $52. If it can, it will represent a 20% rally from current levels. As we said above, Canopy stock is a blue chip name among the cannabis industry. If this group regains momentum, so too should CGC. Earnings may be the spark for that momentum, but we won't know until Friday morning.  * 6 Stocks Ready to Bounce on a Trade Deal If the earnings results inspire investors to gobble up CGC stock, upside targets of $48 and $52 are within reach. If the reaction is negative or if the 50-day acts as resistance, I'm looking for support near $40. Below opens the door to some serious declines, but let's not get ahead of our skis. Let's see the report before going any further.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-07-01,"When it comes to making great investments, few stocks can match the power of &quot;inevitables.&quot;Source: Flickr&quot;Inevitables&quot; is a concept popularized by legendary investor Warren Buffett. It's his term for big companies that dominate their industries. The companies have such well entrenched and well defended spots in the marketplace that their continued success and customer loyalty is virtually inevitable.This makes inevitables excellent long-term investments that allow you to make big money while still sleeping well at night.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn 1996, Buffett specifically pointed out Coca-Cola's extremely strong position in the beverage industry … and how it would enable the company to prosper for generations.As you can imagine, Buffett loves to own inevitables. He's been a big shareholder in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for decades … and made billions of dollars doing it.I like to take Buffett's concept a little further. I love to invest in massive business trends that are so entrenched … have such bright futures … and such strong future demand, that strong growth is virtually guaranteed.That's why I believe investing in specific trends in the healthcare and insurance industries are great financial decisions right now. Let me explain.Investing in Your HealthWe know that there will always be growth in the healthcare sector. However, the biggest growth opportunities within the sector can vary. After doing extensive research, I know just where to invest now: home healthcare.In 2018, the global home healthcare growth market was worth $205.78 billion. And according to Adroit Market Research, that market should more than double to $641.10 billion by 2025. This will be due in part to patients with chronic diseases, rising disposable income, greater awareness for lifestyle disorders and technological developments. The elderly population will drive a lot of this growth. As of 2017, it accounted for nearly 13% of the global population, and it is expected to grow about 3% annually.Given this growth, now is the time to invest in the home healthcare stocks, and I believe I have found the one. It has been around for more than 20 years, it's seen triple-digit earnings growth, and it has reported over $2 billion in revenue. In addition, it holds the coveted A-rating in Portfolio Grader.That means it is a screaming buy right now.My stock pick is an under-the-radar name that is well-positioned to profit off of the home healthcare trend as it continues to expand.I just recommended this stock in my Breakthrough Stocks service, and I've got the full details waiting there for you now. Click here to learn more and sign on to get this stock pick today.The Importance of InsuranceAs important as it is to manage risk when investing, we need to manage risk outside of the stock market, too. This is where insurance comes in. It is an effective way to manage risk for things like healthcare, automobiles, life and even our pets.Within this space, I am most interested in specialty insurance. This is insurance that can be purchased for items that are special or unique. These policies are important for items that are not usually covered under other insurance policies, like a classic car or a boat.According to iCrowdNewswire, in 2018, the global specialty insurance market was at $220 million. By 2025, it should hit $310 million. Because it's a smaller market, the key for big profits is to find the player with the biggest reach.And I found just that player.This company has business across the entire United States, and has seen big growth. Its earnings are up in the triple-digits, and its sales have been very strong, too. It also holds an A-rating in Portfolio Grader, and based on company management's projections for the next quarter, I expect this stock to be a strong performer going forward.I just issued a recommendation for the name in my Breakthrough Stocks service, so make sure to sign up now for all the details.

2019-07-01,"The old Wall Street saying &quot;buy the rumor, sell the news&quot; was in full effect Monday. Following news released over the weekend that the U.S. and China are willing to restart trade talks, accompanied by some encouraging tweets from President Donald Trump to that effect, the major U.S. equity benchmarks opened significantly higher Monday.Source: Shutterstock Holding those big gains was a different story as the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 closed higher by 1.06% and 0.77%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average started the week to the upside by 0.44%.In late trading, about two-thirds of the Dow's 30 members were higher, but that group did not include, perhaps surprisingly, all of the Dow's technology components. Technology, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, has been an epicenter for tariff talks. It is widely expected the group will rally if US-China trade hostilities ease.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPresident Trump cleared the way for Huawei, the controversial Chinese telecommunications company, to resume purchases of products from U.S. technology firms, as long as those goods are not related to national security. Even with that news, however, Dow semiconductor name Intel (NADSAQ:INTC) closed up just 0.38% today. Trade Talk Winners in the Dow Jones TodayWhile there were some obvious disappointments today-we're looking at you, Intel-many of the Dow's best performers were names with high tariff sensitivity. Prime example: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which added 1.83% to rank as one of the Dow's best-performing components today. That's a good start to the third quarter, a period in which the iPhone maker historically delivers for investors, but some analysts are cautious.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer &quot;Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan on Monday reiterated his Buy rating for Apple stock, but he's becoming more cautious over the smartphone maker's app store sales in China,&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Mohan cited third-party data on app store sales which implied Apple China app store sales growth went from 23% year-over-year in April, to 19% in May, and 5% in June.&quot;Another Dow winner on Monday was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which added 1.34% after an arbitrator ruled the world's largest soft drink maker can sell its own energy drink. That ruling could jeopardize Coca-Cola's partnership with Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), a stock that found a way to close higher today, too.&quot;An arbitration tribunal ruled on June 28 that Coca-Cola Energy did not violate the non-compete clause in the company's contract with Monster,&quot; reports The Atlanta Business Chronicle. &quot;According to the ruling, Coke can continue to sell the drink in the markets it has already launched in and can expand to other markets as it sees fit.&quot;JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was another Dow leader today, likely a symptom of what we noted here last Friday. The bank has impressive plans to return major amounts of capital to shareholders via an increased dividend and bigger-than-expected share buyback effort.Dow (NYSE:DOW), the only chemicals name in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (and a somewhat tariff-sensitive name at that), added 1.72% today and has recently been showing some signs of life. Read an article from last week about why the stock is inexpensive and may not be that way for long. Bottom Line: Shifting Focus?Following the G-20 summit, it is important for all investors to realize what happened. Simply put, two bickering sides said they are going to talk on cordial terms. What comes of those negotiations remains to be seen. The U.S.-China relationship is one with long-term implications and the U.S. deficit with China of $420 billion (in 2018) will not be erased overnight.Trade issues with China are not put to bed, but with the trade meeting over, market participants will be looking elsewhere for catalysts. Second-quarter earnings will be one of the catalysts, but how negative or positive is yet to be determined.&quot;Heading into the end of the second quarter, 113 S&P 500 companies have issued EPS guidance for the quarter,&quot; said FactSet. &quot;Of these 113 companies, 87 have issued negative EPS guidance and 26 companies have issued positive EPS guidance. The number of companies issuing negative EPS for Q2 is above the five-year average of 74.&quot;Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-02,The company’s innovative strategy could produce high returns,Why Coca-Cola Is a Buy
2019-07-02,"As we start the latter half of the year, markets face uncertainty as to how the trade wars will develop, what the Federal Reserve will do next and whether the tensions with Iran will keep heating up. I am going to discuss three Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks that are appropriate for long-term portfolios: Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).Having a long-term focus enables investors to patiently get through the weekly noise of the markets while they relax with the knowledge that their portfolio stocks have the quality to weather short-term adverse developments. These investors do not need to make constant plans for the payment of capital gains taxes as they do not have to worry about selling their shares in the short-run.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer Finally, all three stocks pay stable dividends, which adds up over the years. Income investors know that they can compound their returns through reinvesting dividends from high-yielding shares.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pfizer (PFE)Source: Shutterstock Pfizer is one of the world's largest prescription drug companies. Its global portfolio includes medicines, vaccines, and consumer healthcare products.PFE stock's commercial operations fall under three segments:  * Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group (Biopharma), a science-based innovative medicines business  * Upjohn, a global, off-patent branded and generic established medicines business  * Consumer Healthcare, which includes Pfizer's over-the-counter medicinesPfizer's robust clinical pipeline has provided the company with impressive returns over the past few years. The group owns two of the world's best-selling drugs: the breast cancer treatment Ibrance and the blood thinner Eliquis (co-owned by Bristol-Meyers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)).2019 has been a big year for pharma mergers and acquisitions (M&A). In June, Pfizer announced that it would be acquiring Array BioPharma (NASDAQ:ARRY), the cancer-fighting specialist biotech, in a deal worth $11.4 billion. ARRY's two drugs, Braftovi and Mektovi, have already been approved for treating metastatic melanoma. In Array BioPharma's last quarter results, the two drugs combined achieved $35.1 million in sales.This acquisition is likely to strengthen Pfizer's long-term position in oncology, which is regarded as one of the fastest-growing segments of the pharmaceutical industry. Although analysts regard this buyout as a good decision for Pfizer, it is likely to be several quarters before the positive financial effects appear in PFE's balance sheet.On April 30, the company reported Q1 2019 earnings that came to 85 cents. Total revenue stood at $13.1 billion, higher by 1.64% year-over-year (YoY).  The next earnings report will be out in late July. Most investors don't think of Pfizer as a high-growth biotech, but they do recognize it as a mature and defensive big pharma with stable revenues.If you are interested in buying into PFE stock, you may want to study the next earnings release to decide whether you should own it for the long-term. With its robust balance sheet, low volatility, and strong AA S&P rating, the shares could be suitable for diversified portfolios.PFE stock could also provide shareholders with a steady stream of income for decades to come. Pfizer's dividend, which currently stands at about 3.3%, has increased for nine of the last 10 years. Pfizer's cash flow is strong and should allow a dividend increase well into the future. Coca Cola (KO)Source: Coca-ColaCoca-Cola is the world's largest beverage company with 20 different brands that generate more than $31 billion dollars in annual revenues. Many investors have regarded KO stock as a reliable investment over the years.Coca-Cola stock tops the list of Warren Buffet's longtime favorite holdings. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) owns 400,000,000 shares of Coca-Cola, worth over $18 billion. In the last quarter of 2018 when many stocks suffered sizable losses, KO was the only green stock among the top 10 holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.Yet most of this decade, KO has had its share of challenges and seen declining revenues. There has been a drop in soda sales as the U.S. consumer moves towards healthier beverages like flavored water. It is worth mentioning that despite the decline in soda sales, gross margins have remained stable at about 60%.Management has steered the company toward offering a beverage portfolio that seizes on the public's increased appetite for flavored drinks. In 2016, the company announced its &quot;One Brand Strategy&quot; and introduced a common visual identity and creative campaign for all brands.This year, the company introduced a U.S.-wide ad campaign for its new flavor, Orange Vanilla Coke. As a result of the changes in product offerings, cherry and vanilla-flavored Cokes account for about 9% of the dollar volume but bring in 18% of the dollar growth.KO also recently completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee, the biggest coffee chain in the U.K. Wall Street believes the purchase could lead to increased diversification away from soda and revenues, especially prompted by growth in the Chinese market, where Costa Coffee has almost 500 stores.Offering hot beverages for the first time is yet another strategic step for the group as it addresses the shift in consumer taste and purchasing behavior.As you decide what may be next for KO stock fundamentally, you may also want to think about whether the global economy or the U.S. is headed for a slowdown or recession.During periods of market volatility or economic downturn, consumer staples tend to be among the last products removed from household budgets. In other words, defensive stocks like KO may help your portfolio when the going gets tough in the markets.Despite the question marks regarding future growth at Coca-Cola, its dividends make the shares rather attractive. In February, the company increased its dividend and declared a new share buyback program.  * The 7 Top Small-Cap Stocks Of 2019 The current dividend yield stands at 3.1% -- another reason why I believe KO stock belongs to a capital-growth portfolio. The next dividend payment is scheduled for July 1, 2019 to shareholders who purchased Coca-Cola stock prior to the ex-dividend of June 13. McDonald's (MCD)Source: Shutterstock McDonald's operates in the fragmented food service industry, which includes competitors like Yum Brands (NYSE:YUM), Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). It has over 36,000 restaurants in over 100 countries.McDonald's latest earnings results came in better than expected. Group revenues of $4.95 billion topped analysts' estimates of $4.94 billion. Management gave an upbeat outlook on long-term growth and profitability.In addition to the acceleration of U.S. sales, McDonald's stock has benefited from international growth. Comparable U.S. store sales rose 4.5%. Global comparable-store sales rose 5.4%, mostly thanks to promotional mixed-priced deals, as well as store renovations.As one of the largest fast food chains around the globe, over 90% of the restaurants are currently franchised. The franchising business gives McDonald's a competitive edge as the initial fees and ongoing royalties mean high margins. MCD's operating margins now stand at almost 30%. As the franchisees carry the operating costs and business risks, McDonald's does not have to worry about the expenses of running those operations.The company owns most of the properties where their restaurants operate and collects rent from franchisees. MCD leases those out to the franchisees, often at significant markups. It may not be wrong to say that the company is in the real estate business as much as food services.In 2015, management initiated a turnaround plan focused on making MCD more agile by slimming down the corporate structures, improving menu quality, and delivering better customer service. Almost five years later, the steps have been paying off.As part of its efforts to improve shareholder value, McDonald's has increased dividend payments since its first-ever dividend payment in 1976. The next dividend payment of $1.16 per share is expected to be paid out on Sep. 17. The current dividend yield stands at over 2.2%.On June 25, MCD stock price saw an all-time high of $206.39. Year-to-date, the stock is up 18%. Although there might be some profit-taking in the MCD stock price in the coming weeks, I'd regard any dip as an opportunity to go long the shares. The company is a core consumer staples holding for a well-diversified portfolio.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-02,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Sellers of euro-denominated corporate bonds had their best fund-raising month for three years in June, topping off their best six months since 2012. Some 210 billion euros ($238 billion) in new company debt was snaffled up by investors between January and June, 21% higher than the same period last year.Conditions are rarely better than this for company borrowers as benchmark sovereign bond yields keep falling and credit spreads (the difference between the interest rate on corporate bonds and the yields on those sovereign benchmarks) tighten. And there’s more good news on the horizon possibly, with the European Central Bank thinking about restarting its corporate bond-buying program to help reboot the euro zone’s floundering economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of several banks to forecast a return of the ECB to the company credit market.It’s been a frenzy of issuance in 2019, with the consumer goods giants dominating at more than 40% of the total. So-called “Reverse Yankees,” where U.S. companies issue euro-denominated bonds, have featured prominently as American multinationals take advantage of record low interest rates to fund their euro-area operations. Coca-Cola Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Altria Group Inc. all did substantial deals, with nearly 50 billion euros raised this year from U.S entities. The big issuer was Medtronic Plc, a medical products supplier, which came to the market twice with jumbo deals for a total of 12 billion euros.One other statistic stands out at the turn of Europe’s corporate bond year: Nearly half of the issuance has been in maturities of longer than 10 years. As I’ve written regularly, there’s a desperate hunt for yield and investors prefer to buy long-term debt than settle for negative returns.No wonder there’s little sign of the momentum stopping; July is looking very healthy already with eight company issuers announcing new deals on Monday.The chance of the ECB piling in again merely adds to the sense of expectation. Between June 2016 and December 2018 the euro zone’s central bank amassed 178 billion euros of investment grade euro-denominated corporates (although it avoided buying bank paper). The splurge was long-anticipated and credit spreads tightened in expectation of its arrival. A restart to the program – or even the hope of its return – could trigger a similar tightening this time around. If Goldman’s call is correct, that might happen as early as September. This would suggest a balmy summer indeed for credit spreads.To contact the author of this story: Marcus Ashworth at mashworth4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Marcus Ashworth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European markets.

2019-07-03,"Last year, cannabis stocks stole the show in a difficult stock market setting where regular stocks struggled. Marijuana stocks traded wildly for a while, but now they have settled inside more predictable and narrower trading ranges. That is the point of today's write up. Pot stocks present a viable long-term trading thesis.Source: Shutterstock Coming into this morning, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) stock is up almost 50% year-to-date and 200% since the beginning,  This is in better than ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ), and in line with stars like Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB). So other than Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY), these stocks are beating the S&P 500 by a double.But…InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis morning CGC stock is falling on news that the board terminated co-CEO Bruce Linton. Reactions to headlines are usually overblown, so this is definitely an opportunity for those who want to go long the stock and waiting for an opportunity. The Opportunity in CGC StockAlthough we don't know all the details yet, we know enough about it to know that there is a lot of money on the line. Canopy must find a suitable replacement for him to keep the train on track.Canopy Growth has a lot going for it. This is the original marijuana stock that legitimized the bunch. That's mostly because it attracted a $4.5 billion dollar investment from Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ). That was a serious sum of money that caught the attention of Wall Street.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice The overall bullish thesis on pot stocks is that the use of cannabis has far more to it than just its recreational use. Yes, the demand there is solid and is sure to grow as more states legalize the stuff. But there are bigger markets just waiting for the opportunity to become more mainstream.For example the edibles market already exists and is growing in legal states. But the more exciting one is the potables. This is likely what attracted STZ to the sector. The consensus is that cannabis drinks will disrupt the soda, beer and spirits industries.Other mega-cap beverage companies are actively seeking similar opportunities in pot ventures. But there is a giant kink in this effort. Marijuana is still federally illegal in the United States, so not many will commit the cash until that changes. After all, dealing with the stuff across state lines would be breaking the law.Still,  Altria (NYSE:MO) invested almost $1.8 billion dollars into Cronos so it's only a matter of time before more mainstream companies own cannabis businesses.Meanwhile, I consider CGC to be the king of all marijuana stocks, much like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is to most tech stocks. They have a good model, proven management and a strong balance sheet, so they can execute on plans.The fundamentals behind running a successful cannabis company rely heavily on deliveries. In other words, they can sell as much of the stuff as they can produce, so it becomes a race to capacity. It doesn't take a marketing genius to promote a popular substance.This is a long way of saying that the future for Canopy Growth is almost a sure thing. But as simple as this sounds, the hurdles are still gigantic, which is probably why investing in these stocks is still so risky. It is a bet on the concept of cannabis adoption into mainstream use.This very uncertainty makes it almost impossible to short Canopy Growth stock with conviction. Because in addition to the general-use applications, there is a giant world of health aspects for cannabis and derivatives like CBD. Drug companies have been experimenting with it for years, so the applications there are likely to grow exponentially.Moreover, there are the rampant and often unsubstantiated claims of cure-all healing powers that are driving hundreds if not thousands of new products. In California, I can't escape the marketing push for cannabis in its many forms. I get inundated from the supermarket to the gym. It will take regulators years to sift through the fake stuff from the real so this is mania will linger.Nevertheless over all the bullish thesis on cannabis stocks like CGC is legitimate. These are innovators trying to establish a legitimate business from scratch and they have to fight the law to do it.So there are two ways dealing with CGC stock. The first is to plug ones nose and buy it for the long term. I did this with Uber (NYSE:UBER) and I don't plan on looking at it for years.The second way is to be more tactical and snipe shorter-term entries and exits points based on the chart patterns. But this morning's drop makes this effort futile. It is big enough to make it worth a fundamental and a tactical entry at the same time. There is support through the $32 per share area.In summary, as frothy as valuations are for companies like Canopy, the upside opportunity is undeniable. The math doesn't make sense at this point in time, but the concept does.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-07-08,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders clearly expect to hear more good news when the beverage and snack giant reports its fiscal second-quarter numbers on Tuesday morning. Pepsi stock is up 9% since its most recent quarterly report. It has also rallied nearly 18% since the Q4 2018 Pepsico earnings. By consumer-staples standards, that's a monumental run up.Source: Shutterstock It's also not a terrible bet. Although the big move does present some valuation-based challenges for Pepsi stock, it's been years since Pepsico earnings have missed. Indeed, it's only failed to beat quarterly bottom-line estimates once in the past three years alone.Still, the sheer scope of the multi-month gain sets the stage for potential profit-taking. Should the Pepsico earnings report present anything less than ideal, a beat may prove irrelevant.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pepsico Earnings PreviewFor the most recent look, analysts collectively expect the company to report earnings of $1.50 per share of Pepsi stock. Additionally, forecasts call for sales of $16.42 billion. That bottom line would be up versus the operating profit of $1.49 per share that Pepsico booked in the comparable quarter from a year earlier. Furthermore, revenue at that level would mark a 2.1% improvement on the year-ago top line of $16.1 billion.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy That Are Down in 2019 Adverse currency-exchange rates have been and continue to weigh results down. However, please note that rivals like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) have lamented the same headwind. During the first fiscal quarter of 2019, disadvantageous foreign exchange rates reduced Pepsico's per-share profit by 2%. 3 Things to WatchWhile a multi-faceted company, investors will only be able to respond to the most noteworthy changes in the company's business. Three items presently matter more than any other. As such, they need to be weighed carefully during and following the Q2 Pepsico earnings report.1.Organic SalesOrganic revenue is a figure that strips away the misleading impact of changes in currency-exchange rates. It also removes changes associated with business acquisitions or divestments. In other words, it is a more accurate picture of a corporation's true health and Pepsico stock specifically.For Q1, Pepsico saw organic sales growth of 5.2%. Assuming the company maintains this stride, it's a repeatable target.2.Full-Year GuidanceWith its Q1 Pepsico earnings report, PEP modeled full-year organic revenue growth of 4%. And though it also cautioned per-share profits could decline by 1% in 2019, that would be entirely due to investment being made in its growth. Perhaps more importantly, Pepsico guided for $9 billion in operating cash flow and $5 billion in free cash flow. Management is planning on giving $8 billion of that back in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.Changes to that initial outlook have the potential to move Pepsi stock, for better or worse.3.Revenue Mix Vs. Profit MixNorth America's beverage arm is the company's biggest by revenue, producing 32.2% of Q2 2018's top line. It's not Pepsico's breadwinner in terms of income though. That honor belongs to North America's Frito-Lay snack-food unit. This arm accounted for 23.8% of the year-ago revenue but contributed 39.6% of the company's total operating earnings.While it's unlikely to change much, you should look out for any variances of each unit's sales and earnings contributions. Even small fluctuations could signal trouble and potential disruption of Pepsi's low-margin business. Looking Ahead for Pepsi StockRegardless, investors mostly have to embrace that judging Pepsico stock right now isn't a simple exercise.Just a few days ago, analysts with Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted that FY2019 is an &quot;investment year.&quot; Specifically, management hopes to bolster growth through capability enhancement, manufacturing, and go-to market capacity additions. Further, advertising and marketing investments should increase consumer awareness.It's a work in progress and will be difficult to ferret out any specific impacts just yet. However, the market may respond to a qualitative feel on how this spending is setting up future growth.On the other hand, that qualitative feel for Pepsico stock may not matter at all right now.While it would be unlikely Pepsico fails to continue moving fiscally forward, that might not be enough for Pepsi stock.  Click to EnlargeOne has to zoom out to a multi-year chart of Pepsi stock to fully appreciate it. However, the rebound since May of last year has been more than dramatic. In fact, the 37% jump over this timeframe is unprecedented.It's also carried Pepsico stock back to a familiar resistance line that tags all the major price peaks going back to 2011.Now valued at a trailing price-earnings ratio near 23 and a forward-looking of 24, we've got to get real: there's little plausible room for more upside even if the beverage and snack company does everything it's expected to do. Prior to 2015, a trailing PE anywhere but the mid-teens was unusual. Therefore, you should approach Pepsico stock with caution.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-09,"(Bloomberg) -- PepsiCo Inc., trying to navigate a generational decline in cola consumption, has found one surprise niche: Mountain Dew for gamers.The beverage giant’s caffeine-boosted “game fuel” drink, aimed at video-game enthusiasts competing in tournaments, is selling so well that it can’t keep its re-sealable cap in stock.“Everything they make, we buy, and we’re selling every bit of product we make,” Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo’s chief financial officer, said of the drink’s specialty cap made by a European supplier.As it deals with the decline in overall soda consumption, PepsiCo is also getting a boost from its water business -- including its “pH balanced“ Lifewtr and its LaCroix competitor Bubly. Those brands helped the company mitigate a slide in sales of Gatorade, which has also struggled as consumers turn away from sugar.The company reported quarterly sales and earnings that beat estimates on Tuesday. Sales in PepsiCo’s key North American beverage unit were up, despite sluggish volume, as the company got a boost from higher prices for drinks. The shares were little changed in New York.The company generates significant revenue from food, and Frito-Lay, its salty-snack unit, also posted sales growth, including a double-digit bump at convenience stores in the U.S., according to Johnston.The strong “game fuel” sales come as PepsiCo tries to revitalize the Mountain Dew brand by pushing it to customers who want energy drinks. Energy has been a strong sub-segment of the beverage industry, with rival Coca-Cola Co. launching Coke Energy earlier this year, which adds to the stake it owns in Monster, a top-selling brand along with Red Bull.PepsiCo distributes the energy drink Rockstar, but has had a limited presence in that corner of the market, according to Ken Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta said during a conference call Tuesday that PepsiCo will use its Mountain Dew brand to go after the energy drink market. Game Fuel sells at a premium to regular Mountain Dew, according to prices available on Amazon.com.“We’re trying to move Dew into the energy category in small steps,” he said.(Updates with details from CFO interview throughout.)&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Giammona in New York at cgiammona@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa WolfsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",PepsiCo Finds Elusive Soda Success With Mountain Dew for Gamers
2019-07-10,Near-Term Outlook for the Soft Drinks Industry Lacks Fizz,Near-Term Outlook for the Soft Drinks Industry Lacks Fizz
2019-07-10,"Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock had two recent failed attempts at breaking out from $8 per share. This is a level that has been pivotal since January of 2018 so it's not a surprise to find it sticky here. But this resistance remains the opportunity for the next few months.Clearly the bulls and the bears are in a heated battle over the short-term future of Aurora stock. That is why they keep chopping around these levels. But the important thing for the bull thesis is for ACB to hold its support. Otherwise, the sellers will take control of the reins and the bulls would have to fall back and reset for another set of attempts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI consider this opportunity primarily a swing trade for a momentum stock. These are volatile tickers that move fast in either direction, which makes them tricky to trade without either complete faith or proper knowledge of levels.While I do have some faith that the cannabis industry has a good future ahead, I don't have blind faith that it will. So in this case I must plot the short-term lines that I see here for ACB stock.  * The S&P 500's 5 Best Highest-Yielding Dividend Stocks I need to clarify that the battle though fierce now, year-to-date the ACB is up almost 50%. So this is not the case of a struggling stock. The point from today is to catch the next big burst. The battle here is important for both sides because the breach on one side will carry momentum in that direction.My hunch is that the bulls will eventually prevail and the upside opportunity for ACB is to target a new high. There will be resistance at $8, $9.25 and $10.40 per share. The current ACB price pattern is a sharp descending wedge knocking against a flat floor. Often these resolve themselves upwards especially if there is no new specific reason to sell the stock. First the Fundamentals for ACBThe whole sector is exorbitantly expensive. The valuations are completely insane but that's because we don't yet have a baseline. This is similar to the chase of eyeballs into the dot-com bubble. Only this time we actually do have a market and products so there is actual income flowing into Aurora and other pot stocks.The very fact that legitimate companies like Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and Altria (NYSE:MO) are investing billions into pot companies like Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) is proof enough that there something there.The potential comes from the fact that ACB and the gang need to expand their capacity in order to satisfy the incessant demand that we know is there. But the bigger upside reset will probably come from legislative changes.More and more countries are legalizing cannabis. The U.S. is still lagging even though some states took the plunge individually. Once federal regulations in the U.S. change they open the door for companies like Pepsi (NYSE:PEP) to invest in cannabis then the interest in them turns into a feeding frenzy.One thing is not in doubt: Cannabis has very devout fans. This is true for traditional recreational use, edibles and the expectations of drinkables. Medicine is also incorporating cannabis in many formats. I am also noticing more advertisement for topical spreads which are not yet constrained by the regulatory bodies in the US. Trading ACB StockIf I am already long ACB stock, I just look away for a few months. But for those who have complete faith in the concept and believe that it's only a matter of time before the stars will align for pot stocks, they need to simply plug their noses and buy the ACB shares here. This is a long-term bet that the concept will grow into its valuation.After all, this is an industry that is like a newborn, so young that it's eyes are still shut. It is impossible to short the future prospects of the sector so soon so the bottom -- regardless of ACB fundamentals -- should be shallow. The hopium is still too big.For the short term, the bulls and bears for ACB are playing tug-o-war between $7 and $8 per share. So far the floor has held but the risk now becomes that the action forms a neckline that must hold. Else the sellers prevail and overshoot to test the next support zone around $5. This would be a dip I'd buy.The bottom line is easy. Both sides of the opinions on Aurora stock are passionate. But for now it's impossible to deny the upside potential of such a young company. So it becomes a matter of time before the bears get tired and the bulls overwhelm them on the charts. So I'd rather be long than short this one for the next year.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy for the Second Half of 2019 Another way to go long ACB without committing to the full price of the stock now is to sell December $6 puts and let time do the work. This way I get paid today for the opportunity to own the shares at a 18% discount from now.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-07-15,"What a stellar year 2019 has been so far for the owners  of Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock!  We are increasingly living in an interconnected world in which companies need to digitally communicate with their clients non-stop. A leader in the communication platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) sector, TWLO  has benefited from that trend, enabling  Twilio stock to surge 63% in 2019.Source: Shutterstock TWLO is expected to report its Q2 earnings on Aug. 5. Let us now look at what investors can expect in the second half of the year from TWLO stock. How Does Twilio Make Money?TWLO's cloud communications platform helps small, medium  and large enterprises improve their apps and their digital interactions with their customers. Several of its well-known clients include Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and Yelp (NASDAQ:YELP).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Dependable Dividend Stocks to Buy As of Mar. 31, the company had 2019154,797 active customer accounts (ACAs), compared to 53,985 a year earlier. In fact, the number of active customers using Twilio's platform to communicate with their clients has increased four-fold in about four years. As TWLO attracts  more customers to its platform, its recurring software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue continues to rise.On Apr. 30, Twilio released its Q1  results. Its revenue increased 81% year-over-year (YoY) in Q1, to $233 million. In Q1, its top line rose 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2018.Part of the reason for the  company's Q1 revenue gain was its acquisition of cloud-based email services leader SendGrid, which closed on Feb. 1.The owners of TWLO  stock were also pleased by the fact that the company raised its full-year guidance in conjunction with its Q1 results. Management now expects its 2019 revenue to be between $1.102 billion and $1.111 billion, up from $1.065 billion to $1.077 billion. Similarly the company is calling for adjusted earnings  per share of 11 cents to 13 cents, up from 8 cents to 11 cents previously.TWLO 's revenue growth should accelerate for the rest of the year. As a result, the leading provider of in-app communication solutions is setting the bar quite high for its next earnings report. What Could Derail TWLO Stock?Twilio is regarded as a high-growth company and as a disruptor in its field. And many analysts agree that its best days are possibly ahead. However, Wall Street is also getting concerned about the  rich valuations of Twilio stock.Different analysts may use different metrics to gauge the relative value of companies in different industries. One metric they use is price-sales (PS) ratio. The PS ratio of TWLO stock is over 19.5.Analysts prefer a low PS ratio, ideally below one. However, a PS number between one and two is more common. To put the metric into perspective, the S&P 500 index's average price-sales ratio is 2.1.Another way to analyze a stock's valuation is to compare its valuation to that of other companies in similar industries or segments. In general, SaaS stocks are richly valued. Our readers may be interested to know that the PS ratio for the cloud computing giant Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is 8.8, while Veeva (NASDAQ:VEEV) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), two other SaaS stocks, have P/S ratios of about 16 and 30, respectively.Although the PS ratio of TWLO stock is very high, investors should also remember that PS is only one of many valuation metrics. Moreover, the metric does not take into account the profitability or costs of Twilio.Twilio is also facing increasing competition on multiple fronts from several enterprise software companies, including Salesforce.com and Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND).  The digital communications revolution is here to stay, but the space TWLO operates in is fiercely competitive. The History of TWLO StockTwilio went public in June 2016 at an opening price of $23.99. By Sep. 2016, the price of TWLO stock was hovering around $70.However, on May 8. 2017, Twilio stock reached an all-time low of $22.80. After trading in a narrow range in the next six months, in 2018, Twilio stock began its huge rally.Then came the market selloff during the last quarter of 2018. The decline, which hit the tech sector especially hard,  was seen as an important signal that investors were no longer willing to be exuberant about expensive technology stocks. On Christmas Eve, TWLO stock reached an intraday low of $73.15Over the past 12 months, TWLO stock price has surged over 140%. On June 20, it reached an all-time high of $151. In other words, Twilio stock has run up quite far, quite fast. And its current price is about 100% above where it was on Dec. 24, 2018.Those investors who follow short-term technical charts will be interested to know that TWLO stock has spent a good portion of 2019 in overbought territory. It is possible that some profit-taking may negatively impact Twilio stock in the near future, possibly prior to its Q2 earnings report.TWLO is a growth stock and a speculative stock. Therefore, in the coming weeks, I expect Twilio to be a battleground between investors and traders. While long-term investors would like to see TWLO stock exceed and stay over the $150 level, traders are likely to keep it between $125 and $145.As long as Twilio remains in a long-term uptrend, investors may continue to buy TWLO stock on dips. However, if prolonged profit-taking sends Twilio stock below $110, the validity of the long-term uptrend would need to be re-evaluated. And in the wake of such a decline,  it may be some months before TWLO stock price sets fresh records. The Bottom Line on Twilio StockIn a few weeks, analysts will likely scrutinize Twilio's fundamentals to see if the stock offers any further positive catalysts that may help keep TWLO stock price sizzling in the second half of the year. Any sign that TWLO's growth outlook is not as strong as expected in Q3 or Q4 may be enough to spook Wall Street, sending TWLO stock price lower.Therefore, investors who do not yet have a position in the stock may want to wait until TWLO's earnings report in early August before buying TWLO stock. Doing so will give them a better view of the developments affecting the industry in general and  the company in particular.Those investors who already own Twilio stock may consider taking some money off the table or hedging their positions. Such a hedge would limit their downside risk in the event the market drops or if the bullish thesis on TWLO stock ends up being wrong,.As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with Aug. 16 or Oct. 18 expiration dates could be appropriate, as straight purchases of put options are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility. Investors who choose this route can reevaluate their long positions after TWLO reports its earnings.Well-performing stocks tend to keep on winning, and the recent strength of Twilio stock might be a good indication that within three or four years, investors who buy TWLO stock on weakness are likely to be rewarded handsomely.As of this writing, the author holds KO covered calls that expire on July 19.

2019-07-16,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon’s Prime Day gives shoppers an opportunity to flex their deal-spotting muscles ahead of Black Friday. It also gives package thieves their own chance to warm up.Although the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas see far more parcel deliveries—and therefore, more brazen from-the-stoop thefts, Prime Day’s limited 48-hour window creates a concentrated opening for “porch pirates” to make their move, said Brody Buhler, managing director of Accenture’s post and parcel industry group.It’s hard to pin down exactly how many cardboard boxes are pilfered from plain sight around the invented summer buying spree, since customers can report thefts to one of three sources—the local police department, the retailer or the mail carrier—and those reports aren’t tallied centrally. But according to research from video-doorbell company Ring, 19% of U.S. households had a package stolen at some point in 2017 with an average value of $140 per package. Nextdoor, a social-networking app for neighborhoods, says user comments about package theft spiked 85% between July 18 and 20 last year, the main delivery period for Prime Day packages.“Criminals know about Prime Day—everyone has access to the internet these days,” said James Crecco, a police captain in Jersey City, New Jersey.The police department in Jersey City partnered with Amazon in December to run a sting operation and track down package thieves after hearing from a swelling number of victims of porch piracy. Within just seven minutes of placing the first package, officers made an arrest and ultimately caught 23 robbers over an 11-day period. The department has been thinking about implementing a similar plan in the days following Prime Day, though Crecco said it was waiting to see if Amazon would partner again before renewing the program.Of course, on-the-porch delivery isn’t a new phenomenon in the U.S., with Montgomery Ward launching its dry goods mail-order business while Ulysses S. Grant was president and Sears, Roebuck and Co.’s iconic catalog serving as America’s consumer bible for a century. But the proliferation of e-commerce brought delivery of goods—and chances to pilfer them—to a whole new level. E-commerce accounted for more than 10% of all retail and food service sales in the first quarter, up from about 3% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department. Orders come in all year long, especially as grocery delivery expands, but they’re concentrated around big shopping events. During last year’s Prime Day, members bought more than 100 million products. Amazon has expanded this year’s extravaganza to 48 hours from 36 last year, with Coresight Research forecasting Amazon raking in $5.8 billion globally in sales, up from an estimated $3.9 billion in 2018.“Criminals know about Prime Day—everyone has access to the internet these days.”And that’s just the orders placed on Amazon itself. With rivals from Target Corp. to one-time mail-order king Sears itself leaning into the event, logistics providers will be extra busy in the coming days.The growth of porch piracy has led a number of states, including California, South Carolina, Michigan and New Jersey, to propose bills for stricter penalties for package thieves. In Texas, the problem became so prevalent that state representatives formed a mail theft task force in 2017 and have since passed legislation that makes certain degrees of package theft a felony. Related: Amazon Workers Plan Prime Day Strike at Minnesota WarehouseWhen packages do go missing, most major mail carriers agree to be liable for about $100, leaving the retailer to refund the remaining dollar amount or send a new item. Accenture finds that 70% of consumers won’t return to an online store after a bad delivery experience, which has retailers putting more pressure on logistics companies to give customers what they want, including tracking and delivery flexibility to ensure their wares arrive unscathed.When online shopping first became popular, the “focus was on price, then it became on free shipping, then fast shipping and now consumer-controlled shipping that can be altered until 10 minutes before the package arrives,” Accenture’s Buhler said. The demand for control over delivery comes from concerns about theft combined with increased demand for convenience, he said.Theft's a pervasive problem, and retailers have tried a variety of deterrents but are still looking for the perfect solution. For instance, to attract grocery customers, Walmart Inc. is experimenting with staffers, sporting wearable cameras, arriving in company-owned cars to unpack food in customers’ kitchens. Others are trying to leave deliveries in shoppers’ garages or the trunks of their cars. But with each new test, questions linger about privacy and efficiency, plus one-off issues like escaping pets or malfunctioning apps that deny the employee entry.Amazon itself offers Amazon Lockers, keyless entry and click-and-collect “counters” to give buyers more ways to control how they receive their orders. Amazon Logistics also gives Prime members the opportunity to track the arrival of their packages in real time and to receive a photo of where the box was dropped, the company said. A spokeswoman declined to comment further or share company data on thefts. Rising fear about package theft has helped usher in a new industry altogether: porch security. Brad Ruffkess, a former Coca-Cola Co. employee, installed security cameras at his Atlanta home and watched two boxes get stolen off of his doorstep within weeks of each other in 2017. Frustrated by the limited protection options available, Ruffkess founded BoxLock Inc., a WiFi-connected lock that lets delivery drivers place packages in secure parcel boxes outside users’ homes.BoxLock launched on Prime Day last year and sold out within hours of being posted to the Amazon website, he said. Other innovations that seek to keep porch pirates from their loot include secure parcel mailboxes, in-home package drops, Nest and Ring cameras, and alternative delivery locations through programs like UPS My Choice.“There’s still a lot more innovation to come in package security as e-commerce continues to grow,” Buhler said. “When it gets up to 20% of total shopping and there are so many more packages on people’s doorsteps, we’ll see even more innovation in protecting deliveries.”Back in Jersey City, a booming waterfront metropolis just over the Hudson River from Manhattan, package theft is evenly distributed among high and lower-income neighborhoods, Captain Crecco said, calling it one of the “rare crimes that crosses every economic demographic.” The trick to stopping it is making sure it’s not so simple to pull off for minor criminals looking for a low-effort pull. “It’s easy and criminals aren’t looking for a lot of work,” he said.To contact the author of this story: Olivia Rockeman in New York at orockeman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Lisa WolfsonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Thieves Love Amazon Prime Day as Much as Shoppers

2019-07-17,"It doesn't get much more American than Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) company. And if you've owned the Coca Cola stock since the 1990's then you're up 1200%. But perception is that KO stock is a boring stock to own  -- but clearly the scoreboard proves otherwise.Source: Shutterstock KO is at all-time highs going into its earnings report next week. So is it a time to get long or book some profits into the event?The answer is not straight forward. It depends mostly on the investor time frame. But today we will try to devise a plan.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Coca Cola Stock Price and Levels to WatchThe daily KO stock chart is a steep rising wedge. Those are vulnerable to dips. Because if the ascending trend line of higher lows fails, it carries negative momentum. But when the reason for the rising is fundamental, this technical breakdown of the trend is temporary. In other words, those dips that are opportunities to buy.So for the long-term investor, Coca Cola stock price at these level is not a reason to panic out of it just because an earnings event is coming. But for those looking for new entries into KO there may be better entry points. It may be best to wait out your earnings because the short-term reactions to earnings headlines are usually binary.  * 4 Retail Stocks to Buy in Time for the Back-to-School Rush Even if KO management gives us the profit and loss statement ahead of time, we can't guess which way price will move at the open. What drives KO stock price then will be expectations -- not necessarily the quality of the report.So if Coca Cola stock falls on the headline next, then I would buy the dip.Charts have memory so there is a clear pivotal level in KO stock between $50 and $51 per share. This is prior resistance that now should become forward support. So it would take the management team delivering a disastrous quarter for Wall Street to sell it much lower than $49 per share. But this does happen. In fact it did happen two earnings ago when the stock fell 10% on the February earnings headline.Back then, that was an excellent entry point. But I'm sure that in the throws of it, investors panicked out of Coca Cola stock. That's why we're looking at the chart ahead of time to spot those areas for this report.So to be clear, if I own KO for the long term I should stay the course. But if I'm looking for a new entry point, I wait out the earnings results and hope for a dip.If the stock falls 5% to 10% again then it is a blind opportunity to buy. The last 10% dip resulted in a 20% rally.Stocks that are at all-time highs are not obvious buys just because of gravity. The fundamentals do not change much for Coca-Cola. This proven team that manages a cash cow. They know how to operate and compete against the best. I don't expect a 10% dip this time around. Those are usually reserved for momentum stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) not Coca-Cola or Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP). The risk this time is at worst 5%. The Bottom Line on KO StockKO stock is not cheap. It sells at a 32 trailing P/E ratio and 6 times sales. This is twice as expensive Pepsi. They both offer a comparable 3% dividend yield.In summary, although the long-term reward for owning Coca-Cola stock is huge, going into earnings next week and at all-time-highs is not an obvious point of entry. However if we're lucky and Wall Street panics on the headline then we would pounce. After all, the S&P 500 is also at its all-time highs, so any which way we slice it, onus is on the bulls to maintain this incredible rising wedge going.If I absolutely cannot wait to be long KO stock then I can sell the January $48 put and collect $1 for it. Then all I would need to profit is for KO to stay above it. Else I own the shares at $48 and breakeven at $47 per share.  * 8 Penny Stocks That Have Fallen From Grace Investing is risky business so I only risk what I can lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-07-21,"We’re in the busiest time of earnings season, with over one-fourth of the S&P listed companies set to release quarterly reports in the coming days. Based on the S&P members that have reported so far, results are good. Total earnings are up 2.6%, and revenues are up 2.9%. While slow, this growth is better than the losses predicted before earnings got underway.Here, we look at three blue chip stocks which are reporting earnings this week. They are mainstays of investment portfolios, some are favorites of big-name investors, and all are available at a share price of $55 or less.  AT&T, Inc. (T)The venerable phone company is well-known as one of the best dividend stocks on Wall Street. AT&T offers investors a 6.22% dividend yield – one of the highest among S&P-listed companies – with a current annual payout of $2.04 per share.The dividend is important because T shares show a somewhat shaky earnings future. The company took on tremendous debt last year when it acquired Time Warner; however, free cash flow since then has been sufficient to meet the dividend and the debt service. While AT&T carries $169 billion in debt, the company says that it can pay off 75% of the Time Warner purchase debt by the end of this calendar year.That will be major achievement, and investors will be looking for evidence that it is realistic. AT&T is counting on the acquisition to power its move toward content creation and distribution as it moves into the streaming landscape. The acquisition of Time Warner was intended to bring a solid content provider to T’s DirecTV segment, and boost declining subscriber numbers. On the earnings front, Wall Street expects T to show 89 cents EPS on July 24, up from 86 in the last quarter, but down 2.2% year-over-year.Looking toward T’s performance, JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote back in May that he expects a net loss of 2.9 million DirecTV subscribers in 2019 before seeing trends improve in 2020. At the same time, he expects “average revenue per remaining user to increase 3.4% this year, to $119.65.” His bottom line on the stock: “Sentiment should improve as the trajectory of sub losses improves in late 2019, but our sense is that investors are starting to look past it already—in the meantime the 6.2% dividend will continue to come through.” Cusick’s price target of $38 of suggests an upside of 15% to the T shares.Earlier this month, Citigroup’s Michael Rollins also put a buy rating on T, and bumped his price target up 8.8% to $37. His new target implies an upside of 12% to the stock.Shares in AT&T are selling for $32.79, and the stock holds a strong buy from the analyst consensus. That rating is based on 8 buys and 2 holds given in the past three months. The average price target, $36, suggests that T has room for 9% upside. Coca-Cola Company (KO)Investing guru Warren Buffett has long been a fan of Coca-Cola, both the drink and the stock. He sees the stock as a staple, bringing slow and steady profits, and paying out a reliable 3.1% dividend yield of $1.60 per share annualized. Coca-Cola bases its performance on a solid, and growing, line-up of beverage products.Heading into fiscal Q2, Coca-Cola’s stock is trading just 1.5% below its 52-week high point. The stock hasn’t always had such good times; starting in Q2 2015, the company saw revenues drop every quarter until Q4 2018. The trend has begun to reverse, however, and in Q3 2017 EPS began to grow again, while last quarter, Q1 2019, saw a revenue gain of 5.2%.More health-conscious consumers have been putting pressure on the company, as they shift away from sodas in the US domestic market. Coca-Cola has responded by diversifying its product line, to offer drinks across all segments of the beverage market. The company is already well-known for its Dasani water and Minute Maid juices; the company also owns Costa Coffee and Fuze Beverages.So far, the strategy appears to be working, and KO’s Q2 sales are expected to show an increase of 8.83%, powering a revenue jump of 12%. The expected EPS of 62 cents is 3.3% higher than the year-ago quarter, and 29% higher than Q1. The quarterly earnings are scheduled for release on July 23.Dara Mohsenian, of Morgan Stanley, keeps KO as his ‘top overweight pick,’ saying “the beverage maker offers a growth profile that is underappreciated by the Street.” He adds, “On a two-year average basis, Coca-Cola managed to improve its organic topline growth by 80 basis points in the past few quarters which is above the 70 basis point range many of its peers are showing.”In line with his upbeat outlook on KO, Mohsenian increased his price target by 3.6%, from $55 to $57, indicating confidence in the stock and an upside potential of 11%.Coca-Cola’s analyst consensus rating is a moderate buy, based on 4 buys and 5 holds set in the past three months. The average price target, $52.29, is only 1.75% higher than the current share price of $51.39. These numbers reflect the stock’s ongoing transition away from the losses of recent years and towards the upbeat outlook detailed by Mohsenian. Ford Motor Company (F)Our third pick, Ford Motor, may be the most controversial here. Like Coca-Cola, it has a mixed rating, but it also the highest potential upside, the lowest cost of entry, and the second-highest dividend yield of the stocks in this list. In addition, shares in Ford are up 33% year-to-date, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 18.5% gain.Ford maintains its position by its popular and profitable lineup of pickup trucks. The F-Series (F-150, F-250, and F-350) are consistent best-sellers, and have led the US market in automobile sales since 1986. In 2018 alone, F-Series trucks brought the company $41 billion in revenues. According to Jim Farley, Ford’s head of global markets, that sales performance makes the F-Series a more valuable brand than Coca-Cola.Ford’s management is essentially using the popular and high-margin trucks and SUVs as a cushion while the company is in the process of reducing its small-car sales and developing lines of electric and autonomous vehicles. Possession of such an asset – the F-Series brand – has helped keep Ford’s revenues mostly stable in recent quarters, with revenue volatility in the past three years holding in an 8% range.Looking forward to the Q2 earnings report, Ford’s revenues are expected to come in at $34.86 billion, a slip of 2.9% from the year-ago quarter. True to Ford’s form, Q3 guidance predicts gain of 2.7%. Q2 EPS is expected between 30 and 33 cents, a gain of 11% to 22% over last year’s Q2. EPS for FY2019 is expected at $1.38, a gain of 6.15% from FY2018.Recent analyst reviews of Ford have focused on the company’s strategic partnership with Volkswagen in developing electric and autonomous vehicles. RBC’s Joseph Spak, while keeping a hold on the stock, increased his price target by 10%, to $11, after Ford announced plans to work with VW and Argo AI developing a high volume EV in the European market. Spak says that Ford management deserves high credit for strategic thinking. His price target is 7% above Ford’s current share price.On the bull side is UBS analyst Colin Langan, who boosted his price target to $13 and put a buy rating on the stock. Looking at the European market and Ford’s initiatives in the EV segment, he says, “Given the upcoming European regulation shifts, this should help Ford avoid emission fines.” Langan’s price target suggests a 27% upside to Ford shares.Overall, Ford has a moderate buy from the analyst consensus based on an even split of 6 buys and 6 holds. Shares trade for $10.20 with an average price target of $11.77, giving the company’s stock an upside potential of 15%.",3 Market Staples Reporting Earnings This Week

2019-07-22,"Broadly speaking, stocks were somewhat listless Monday as traders await an absolute avalanche of marquee earnings reports this week.Source: Shutterstock The Nasdaq Composite was the leader among the major U.S. equity benchmarks to start the week, adding 0.71% while the S&P 500 gained 0.28%. Sapped by one of the largest members of the index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, finishing higher by just 0.07%.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio When the closing bell rang, just over half the Dow's 30 components were in the green for the day.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Bad BoeingBoeing (NYSE:BA), the largest member of the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average and a company that reports earnings later this week, was dinged Monday, falling 1.07% after Fitch Ratings trimmed its outlook on the aerospace company to &quot;negative&quot; from &quot;stable.&quot; Fitch cited regulatory uncertainty stemming from the grounding of the 737 MAX passenger jet, but the ratings agency is sticking with an &quot;A&quot; credit rating on Boeing.&quot;The MAX situation also presents significant public relations challenges, and the impact on Boeing's reputation and brand will be a watch item for the next year or more,&quot; said Fitch.Boeing reports second-quarter results Wednesday before the open of U.S. markets with analysts forecasting a profit of $1.89 a share, down from $3.33 a year earlier. More Earnings: UTX and KOSticking with the industrial sector for a moment, shares of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) added 0.44% today in advance of the company's Tuesday pre-market second-quarter earnings report. Wall Street expects UTX to post earnings of $2.05 per share on revenue of $19.6 billion.The stock is inexpensive compared to other large-cap aerospace names, but that probably isn't enough for investors over the near-term. United Technologies' earnings call is likely to revolved around the company's effort to merge with Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), one that has been met with some push back on Wall Street.Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) traded slightly lower today ahead of its Tuesday morning earnings report. The shares are up a market-lagging 8.56% year-to-date, indicating the beverage giant better put some fizz in that earnings report and guidance. Analysts expect Coca-Cola to notch second-quarter earnings of 62 cents a share on revenue of $9.57 billion.&quot;Analysts are evenly split ahead of the report: Eleven think the shares are a Buy, while 11 have a Hold rating or the equivalent on the shares. Just one rates it at Sell. The average analyst price target is $52.48,&quot; reports Barron's. Dow Jones WinnersApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of the best-performing names in the Dow today, adding 2.29% amid some bullish analyst chatter. Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty boosted her price target on Apple to $247 from $231 in a note out today. Apple reports earning on July 30 after the close of U.S. markets.Shares of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) advanced 0.70% on reports that &quot;The Lion King&quot; saw a weekend box office haul of $185 million. That after Disney's &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot; became the highest-grossing film ever earlier this year. Yes, Disney is up about 31% this year, but its upcoming movie lineup indicates more upside could be had in this stock. Dow Jones Today: Bottom LineAs was noted here last week, this week brings a slew of earnings reports with nearly a third of the S&P 500 reporting. Hopefully, the trend of positive surprises continues because this earnings season, so far, has been better than anticipated.&quot;To date, 16% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q2 2019,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;In terms of earnings, the percentage of companies reporting actual EPS above estimates (79%) is above the five-year average.

2019-07-22,"The Dow Jones Index is having an amazing year. From its January low of 22,686, the Dow Jones Index has surged nearly 5,000 points to top 27,000 for the first time. With such huge gains, it's time to start thinking about what Dow Jones stocks to sell.As you'd expect, when the market as a whole rips so much, it sets up some great profit-taking opportunities in individual stocks out of the Dow Jones' 30 components.  * 7 Defense Stocks to Buy to Fortify Your Portfolio From vulnerable healthcare stocks to overpriced consumer staples plays and more, here are five Dow Jones stocks to sell before the market slides again.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks To Sell: Boeing (BA)It has been baffling watching Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock recently. You would have expected a massive correction in BA stock since several of the company's jets crashed, calling into question the safety of the Boeing Max line of jets.Instead, BA stock has been astoundingly resilient. This would be one thing if BA stock had already been cheap when the safety issues began. But no, BA stock wasn't cheap at all. It had just quadrupled in value since early 2016 and reached its highest P/E ratio in years in March.It seems that investors have forgotten that the airline industry is cyclical. Yes, oil prices are low right now. Airlines are making a lot of money for the moment. When airlines make huge profits, they order planes. In fact, they order too many planes. This cycle has happened every few years dating back to the 1960s. Yet investors seem to think this commercial aviation boom will go on forever. It won't.On the military side, yes, orders have been up. But analysts modeling this upturn in defense spending indefinitely will also be disappointed. What happens if and when the Republicans lose power in Washington? There's also the little matter that we have no idea how bad the issues will be from the Boeing Max situation. BA stock is still really expensive. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Shutterstock The chase for yield has investors rushing back into a lot of slow-growing defensive companies. The rationale makes sense on the surface. Lower interest rates mean that bonds are less attractive investments.Yet investors, especially retirees, still need current income. So they sell their bonds and other fixed income holdings to buy stocks with larger yields. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one such popular stock.It's not hard to see the appeal of KO stock as a bond alternative. It yields more than U.S. Treasuries or bank CDs while offering a dividend that Coca-Cola has increased every year for decades on end.However, cracks are forming in Coca-Cola's growth and income story. Namely, there's hardly any growth.Soda sales have plunged in America and other developed markets. Emerging market growth has largely offset this so far, but there are limits to that. Soda sales may drop even more sharply going forward as more jurisdictions implement sugar taxes. As a result, Coca-Cola has hardly grown in recent years - it has taken on more debt and boosted its dividend payout ratio to keep the yield going up. That works for a while, but without organic growth, Coca-Cola's dividend stream will turn to a trickle over time.  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Based solely on earnings, for a slow (or at times no-) growth company like Coca-Cola, you'd rarely pay more than 20x earnings, if that. As such, it's hard to justify KO stock being worth more than $45 now. If you own KO stock solely for the dividend, it's a fine holding. But don't anticipate much, if anything, in the form of share price gains over the next year or two. McDonald's (MCD)One has to wonder if McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is about to launch CBD-infused burgers. Or perhaps a national Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) burger rollout. That is to say, investors are bidding up MCD stock like it's a hot craze, even though its business momentum is decidedly pedestrian at best.In fact, many of the company's franchisees have been complaining. All-day breakfast greatly increased complexity for operators and raised labor costs without doing much for overall revenues. McDonald's is also asking its franchisees to make extensive store overhauls even though the local operators haven't exactly been rolling in cash flow lately. Franchisees sent a harshly-worded letter around earlier this year demanding that:&quot;We can NOT afford the waste that a 'one size fits all' reinvestment program creates […] We must allow our owner operators to take back control of the reinvestment that is happening, stop the useless and problematic investing, and focus our reinvestment in what will actually produce a return on investment (drive thrus and kitchens).&quot;Over on Wall Street, however, no one seems worried about McDonald's questionable strategy in recent years. MCD stock is up 36% over the past 12 months and is up more than 22% year-to-date. This has led McDonald's to sport a bloated 28x P/E ratio. Investors are likely to get indigestion when they look back at paying more than $200 a share for MCD stock. UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Source: Shutterstock If you watched the first Democratic presidential debate, you probably won't be too surprised by this pick. A sizable number of candidates, when asked if they would get rid of private for-profit health insurance, raised their hands in affirmation. The political world has moved a lot since 2016, when Bernie Sanders' suggestion of abolishing private health care seemed radical.Now, there's a decent chance that the eventual Democratic nominee will be pushing to outlaw or at least greatly curtail private insurance going forward. Would that nominee, if elected, be able to push legislation through what will likely still be a Republican Senate in 2021? Probably not.Still, do you want to own a private insurer like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) ahead of the election? Absolutely not. Even if you think the Republicans will keep the White House, think back to 2015.  * 9 Retail Stocks Goldman Sachs Says Are Ready to Rip Hillary Clinton went on the attack against Martin Shkreli and biotech firms for jacking up prescription drug prices. Biotech stocks collapsed shortly thereafter. Private health insurers are about as popular as nuclear waste dumps with a large portion of the electorate. With the presidential election still a year away, politicians have plenty of time to threaten and demonize firms like UnitedHealth. Sell this recent pop in UNH stock; it's toxic given the political environment. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Shutterstock On a similar note, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also exposes investors to a great deal of political risk ahead of the election. JNJ is a highly diversified business with many consumer care products that are (mostly) above reproach.But JNJ also sells a lot of prescription drugs, and both Trump and the Democrats are making loud noises about going after pricing, which would cut into JNJ's margins. Trump's efforts to curtail drug prices appear to be stalled for the time being. But make no mistake, the issue is a perfect one for politicians to use to drum up votes during election season.Johnson & Johnson also has its liability issue related to baby powder products which allegedly led to cancer. It is exposed to large verdicts against it related to this. Presumably JNJ will be able to reduce its liability greatly over time as cooler heads prevail, but for now, it's another big overhang on JNJ stock. If JNJ stock were cheaper, you could discount the political worries; it's a very strong and diversified company. But at this valuation, JNJ stock could easily have more downside before it bottoms.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned JNJ stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-07-22,"With Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock close to its 52-week high, investors might be concerned that there's more downside potential than upside. That's especially true with an earnings announcement coming up on Tuesday, prior to the opening bell.Source: Shutterstock On top of that, some KO stock shareholders are nervous because 2019's earnings reports thus far have been less than stellar for a number of blue-chips. For several key reasons, however, I'm choosing to look at the bright side of this famous company's prospects. In short, no need exists to panic-sell just because earnings season is here again. Coca-Cola Stock Price Is Actually UndervaluedBeing close to its 52-week high doesn't necessarily mean that the Coca-Cola stock price is overvalued; in fact, KO stock is lagging its competitors. Compared to the broader beverages market, Coca-Cola shares have underperformed by 8.2% year-to-date. They've also lagged behind the soft-drink giant's blue-chip peer group (including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Keurig Dr. Pepper (NYSE:KDP)) by 6.5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Tech Stocks That Are Still Worth Your Time (And Money) Additionally, the KO stock price isn't too lofty compared to its main competitors: checking in on the company's forward price-earnings ratios, we see that it stands at around 24. That's a good value in relation to its peers in the beverages market. It just goes to show that you can't look at the price chart in isolation.Some elements just don't show up in the KO stock price. Always a Dividend DarlingThrough multiple generations, KO stock has provided a safety net for stakeholders in the form of a healthy dividend yield. That's another factor that isn't reflected in simple price-action charts. The Coca-Cola dividend-king tradition continues to this day. Recently, the company's board of directors declaring a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share.That might not sound like much, but the current dividend yield for KO stock is 3.1%. It's a compelling reason to ignore earnings fears and hold on to this multi-generational income producer. Given that this constitutes Coca-Cola's 57th consecutive annual dividend increase, I feel that any earnings surprise -- positive or negative -- would be nothing more than a bump in the road for this Warren Buffett favorite. Estimates Are Low, and That's a Good ThingWhen analysts set the bar low, skittish investors tend to abandon ship. But I see it as a setup for a pleasant surprise. Analysts collectively expect Coca-Cola's second-quarter earnings to increase by only a penny. That's a mere 1.64% increase over the same quarter the year prior. Not only that, but earnings for this year are projected to increase by just 0.48% compared to the previous year. That's not exactly a massive hurdle to clear.Besides, owners of KO stock have every reason to believe that the company will outperform this time around. Indeed, Coca-Cola has met or beaten earnings estimates every quarter since 2012; over the past four quarters, the average earnings surprise was 2.87%. And, with Coca-Cola's first-quarter 2019 revenues having increased by 5.2%, the outlook (in my eyes, at least) is looking brighter than ever for good old KO stock. The Bottom Line on Coca-Cola StockCoca-Cola stockholders tend to be more conservative investors: less worried about hype and market noise, and more attuned to solid company fundamentals. KO stock has been a classic dividend king and safety net for many years. Earnings hoopla and hubbub are no reason to abandon it now.As of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. dominates the market for ultra-filtered milk -- but now the field’s getting more crowded.Fairlife, which sells milk that’s been filtered to boost its protein and reduce its sugar content, has helped the beverage giant to offset declining soda sales. Now, Coke’s brand will face off against the farmer-owned cooperative Organic Valley, which is poised to begin selling its own line of ultra-filtered milk in Whole Foods stores nationwide and in other retailers.Coke, intent on having products in all major beverage segments, has a minority stake in Fairlife, which launched its ultra-filtered lactose-free milk in 2015 and has dominated the premium milk category with little competition. Sales of Fairlife reached about $134 million in 2018, up 57% from when the products first became available in 2015, according to data from Euromonitor.Fairlife seeks to attract health-conscious customers who have been turning away from milk. Overall, dairy milk consumption is declining in the U.S. as plant-based alternatives proliferate. However, value-added dairy products like ultra-filtered milk have bucked this trend and posting growth, according to data from Nielsen.Milk made from ingredients like oats, soy and almonds is also growing fast, expanding 6% last year while conventional dairy slipped 3%, according to a study by the Plant Based Foods Association and The Good Food Institute.“The dairy market needs to innovate in a market with so many alternatives out there,” said Bob Kirchoff, Organic Valley’s interim chief executive officer. “Offering low-sugar and higher protein is an effort to show that we’re relevant.”The new product from Organic Valley, which is based in La Farge, Wisconsin, may eat into Coke’s growing dairy sales -- especially because shoppers who are willing to pay a premium for their milk may be attracted to an organic option. Fairlife, which isn’t classified as organic, has been able to charge more as the only major filtered milk, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea said.“Having other filtered products alongside Fairlife would work to the detriment of Coke’s pricing power,” he said.Both Fairlife and Organic Valley price their products much higher than unfiltered milk. Target sells a 52-ounce container of Fairlife for $3.39, more than $2 higher than the average milk price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Organic Valley will charge $5.99 for a 56-ounce container, more than $3 higher than the average price of organic milk reported by the USDA.Chicago-based Fairlife came under fire in June after an animal rights group released a video of calves being abused at a dairy farm in Indiana. Two Midwest grocers, Jewel-Osco and Tony’s Fresh Market, pulled the milk from its shelves. Fairlife has since discontinued the use of milk from the farm featured in the video, according to a company statement.Coca-Cola declined to comment about the ultra-filtered milk market.Organic Valley works with local farmers and attracts customers who are focused on animal welfare, Kirchoff said.“We don’t have huge farms with low-cost models,” he said. “We are looking for consumers that are willing to pay for that difference to give value to land, farms and dairy farmers.”&#92;--With assistance from Patrick McKiernan.To contact the reporter on this story: Olivia Rockeman in New York at orockeman1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Craig Giammona, Jonathan RoederFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Coca-Cola’s Dairy Darling Gets Competition from Organic Valley

2019-07-23,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. shares surged to open at a record high Tuesday after its latest earnings got another boost from drinks with less sugar, more than offsetting the company’s sluggish home market.It also updated its forecast for the full year, saying it now expects to post organic revenue growth of 5%, up from the 4% target it had issued earlier. The soda giant rose as much as 4.6% as of 9:31 a.m. in New York. That’s the biggest intraday gain in six years and brings the share price to the highest level since records begin in 1968.“I came into the year concerned; so far the strategy has produced stronger results,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said in an interview.Global unit case volume rose 3% in the second quarter, helped by a 7% spike in Asia, where Chinese consumers have been key to the company’s success this year. That has triggered more investments in the region, Quincey said. But volumes slipped in North America for the third straight quarter. Coke, like its chief rival PepsiCo Inc., has struggled to boost beverage consumption in its home market, where higher prices on drinks have helped offset the volume drop.Coke, as it tries to fend off Pepsi and other upstart competitors, has been diversifying beyond sugary drinks. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar logged a seventh straight quarter of double-digit volume growth globally, it said. The company is also pushing deeper into the canned coffee market after its high-profile acquisition of the British cafe chain Costa for $5.1 billion. Coca-Cola HBC, one of the company’s bottlers, recently said it will launch Costa Coffee in at least 10 markets in 2020, including Russia, Bulgaria, Greece and Poland.Grappling with the strong dollar, Coke had already warned that earnings will be roughly flat this year. Despite the higher revenue guidance, it expects stronger-than-expected currency effects the rest of the year. The stock had gained 8.2% through Monday’s close, lagging the performance of PepsiCo and the S&P 500.“We have a good strategy, we’re executing at full force and that’s what we’re focused on. Those are the bits we can control,” Quincey said. “The macros will be more helpful or less helpful, but we’re really focused on what we can control.”(Adds CEO interview details throughout)&#92;--With assistance from Karen Lin.To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Giammona in New York at cgiammona@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Coca-Cola Opens at Record High After Global Drink Volumes Climb

Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 0.45%.In the options pits, the chasm between call and put volume widened Tuesday with around 18.1 million calls and 13.4 million puts traded. The pick up in call demand makes sense given the broad market rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe action at the CBOE followed the bullish script as well with a drop in the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.61. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average ticked up to 0.61.Options activity favored the call side in most stocks topping the most-actives list. Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) shares surged to record highs after a solid earnings beat. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) led the bank stock rally with a strong breakout. Finally, Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) was flooded with activity ahead of today's ex-dividend date.Let's take a closer look: Coca-Cola (KO)The soda king delivered a sugar high to investors yesterday after smashing earnings forecasts. For the second quarter, Coca-Cola earned 63 cents per share on $10 billion in revenue. Factset consensus called for earnings of 61 cents on $9.9 billion revenue.Wall Street cheered the results, pushing KO stock up 6.1% to a record high. On the charting front, everything is awesome. The uptrend is robust and now increasing in momentum. And moving averages are rising across all time frames. Despite this year's gains, the dividend yield for KO still sits at an attractive 2.94% with quarterly 40 cent payouts.  * 10 Tech Stocks to Buy Now for 2025 As far as options trading goes, calls ran the tables all day long. Total activity zoomed to 976% of the average daily volume, with 174,255 contracts traded; 73% of the trading came from call options alone.Implied volatility was baking in a $1.36 or 2.7% move into the earnings release, so the 6.1% jump was a massive move relative to expectations. Chalk this one up as a big win for volatility buyers. Bank of America (BAC)Bank stocks were on the move yesterday with Bank of America leading the charge. Shares of the historically sleepy stock awoke in a big way, rising 2.3% on the session. That places BAC at a two-month high and on firm footing to attack this year's peak of $31.17.While the short-term trend is rising, the intermediate- and long-term trends still have work to do. BAC stock has been in a range for so long that it's going to take more than a two-month rise to pull them higher. Volume patterns are lending a hand to bulls with three powerful accumulation days over the past few weeks, showing institutions are wading into the waters.On the options trading front, traders favored calls throughout the session. Activity grew to 161% of the average daily volume, with 331,430 total contracts traded. Calls claimed 58% of the day's take.Implied volatility drifted at 21% or the 17th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are scraping the bottom of the barrel so don't expect much if you're looking to sell options here. Delta Airlines (DAL)The airline industry was another space joining Tuesday's market rally. Delta Airlines was a big winner on the day as traders bought up its stock ahead of tomorrow's ex-dividend date. As is often the case ahead of these quarterly payouts, investors took to the options market for short-term control of the stock to qualify for the cash payment.DAL stock carries a dividend yield of 2.57% with 40 cents due to shareholders of record as of yesterday's close. Dividends aside, its price chart doesn't look half bad either. A summer surge has Delta flying at record highs. Last week's pullback created a lower-risk entry that was enthusiastically bought.

2019-07-25,"The stock market has surged to all-time highs in 2019, and this broad market rally has been a rising tide that has lifted most boats. As a result, many of the market's favorite stocks - think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), so on and so forth -- have similarly rallied to fresh 2019 highs.Committing new money to stocks that are hitting all-time highs is tough to do. After all, we are taught as investors that stocks don't go up in straight lines forever. Eventually, all-time high socks have to come back down to Earth. As such, I can't blame anyone for not wanting to buy the market's favorite stocks at new highs (though I think many of them will stay in rally mode for the foreseeable future).That's why I've put together a list of high quality stocks which aren't trading at new highs. Instead, these are high quality, oversold stocks which have beaten and bruised in 2019 amid a record market rally. The rationale is that the relative under-performance in these names year-to-date creates potential for huge upside over the next few months.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn order to make the list, the oversold stock needed to have four key characteristics:* High Quality: the core fundamentals of the company have to be strong and healthy and lend themselves to steady profit growth over the next several years.* Bear Market: the stock needs to be in bear market territory, or 20% or more off 52 week highs.* 10%+ Below 200-Day Moving Average: the stock needs to be substantially below its long term trend-line, or 10% or more below its 200-day moving average.* Relative Strength Index &lt;70: the stock needs to have not rebounded in a big way recently, so that the Relative Strength Index remains below near-term overbought territory.  * 10 Small-Cap, Up-And-Coming Stocks to Keep on Your Radar With that in mind, let's take a look at seven oversold stocks which have huge upside potential over the next few months. Activision (ATVI)Source: Shutterstock % Off 52 Week High: 45%% Below 200-Day Moving Average: 10%14-Day Relative Strength Index: 44Why It Dropped: Shares of video game publisher Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI) have dropped nearly 50% off their 52-week highs for two big reasons. First, the broader video game industry has slowed dramatically in 2019 after red hot growth in the prior several years. Second, Activision's product line-up has been poor in this bad video game environment. The result has been sluggish top and bottom line growth trends for the past several quarters and a stock in free fall.Why It Could Rebound: Demand is not a secular issue in the video game industry. Instead, demand is just cooling this year after multiple consecutive years of big growth and in the absence of new console launches. But the lap will get easier next year, and new consoles and cloud gaming platforms will launch, too. As such, video game demand should ramp back up over the next few quarters. At the same time, Activision's content lineup in the second half of 2019 looks promising. This combination should ultimately breathe life back into Activision's financial results and spark a big rebound in ATVI stock. Foot Locker (FL)Source: Shutterstock % Off 52 Week High: 34%% Below 200-Day Moving Average: 20%14-Day Relative Strength Index: 48Why It Dropped: Shares of athletic footwear retailer Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) have plummeted over the past few weeks thanks to what the market perceived as bad first-quarter numbers which showed signs of trade war headwinds. Specifically, margins came under pressure in the quarter, and management implied that such pressures would persist so long as tariff headwinds remained in place. As such, FL stock has been a big victim of trade war noise.  * 7 Stocks to Sell This Summer Earnings Season Why It Could Rebound: Foot Locker's Q1 numbers were actually pretty good. Comparable sales rose nearly 5%. Gross margins expanded by 30 basis points. Operating margins fell only 10 basis points. Those are some of the best numbers this company has reported in recent memory, and it's mostly because athletic apparel demand -- specifically, Nike (NYSE:NKE) demand -- remains red hot. Thus, once trade headwinds pass (they should improve over the next few months), FL stock will rebound in a big way. Tesla (TSLA)Source: Shutterstock % Off 52 Week High: 32%% Below 200-Day Moving Average: 10%14-Day Relative Strength Index: 69Why It Dropped: Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) were severely beaten and bruised in early 2019 as poor Q1 delivery numbers spooked many investors into thinking that the best of the Tesla growth narrative had already come and gone.Why It Could Rebound: Strong Q2 delivery numbers proved that the best of the Tesla growth narrative hasn't already come and gone and that bad Q1 results were an anomalous byproduct of unusually weak global EV demand (which was catalyzed by a plethora of factors, most of which won't repeat going forward). Over the next several quarters, Tesla's numbers will continue to improve thanks to better Model 3 delivery logistics in Europe and Asia and Model S and Model X refreshes. As those numbers get better, TSLA stock will bounce back to $300-plus prices. Canopy Growth (CGC)Source: Shutterstock % Off 52 Week High: 38%% Below 200-Day Moving Average: 15%14-Day Relative Strength Index: 33Why It Dropped: There's been a lot of noise in the cannabis industry recently, headlined by growing inventories and rumors of weaker-than-expected demand going forward. At Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), that noise has coupled with operational issues (the company's second quarter numbers weren't too great) and executive turmoil (Canopy's co-CEO was recently fired). All of these issues have come together to spark a near 40% sell-off in CGC stock over the past few weeks.  * 7 Stocks to Buy This Summer Earnings Season Why It Could Rebound: CGC stock will rebound into the end of 2019 for four reasons. First, executive turmoil will pass as Canopy moves forward with a new CEO. Second, Canadian cannabis market sales trends will improve meaningfully over the next few months because it appears that supply issues are resolved. Third, investors will want to buy into CGC stock ahead of the December legalization of edibles in Canada. Fourth, U.S. legislation should continue to progress towards nationwide legalization, thereby further opening the door for Canopy to extend its dominance into the U.S. market. Netflix (NFLX)Source: Shutterstock % Off 52 Week High: 20%% Below 200-Day Moving Average: 10%14-Day Relative Strength Index: 23Why It Dropped: Shares of global streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) crashed in July because the company missed on the only number that mattered in its Q2 earnings report -- global streaming adds. And they didn't just narrowly miss -- they missed by the widest margin ever. Investors freaked out, thinking that the best of Netflix narrative is already over, and that forthcoming competition in 2020 will only further flatten out this company's growth trajectory.Why It Could Rebound: The world is still pivoting to streaming TV. Netflix is still the undisputed leader in streaming TV. Bad second-quarter numbers were just a hiccup in a still healthy secular growth narrative. Next quarter's numbers are expected to be &quot;back to normal&quot;. Given that management never misses on sub guidance in back-to-back quarters and that the summer content slate is very good for Netflix, next quarter's robust sub guide seems very doable. When Netflix does report very good third-quarter numbers, NFLX stock will bounce back in a big way. AMC Entertainment (AMC)% Off 52 Week High: 52%% Below 200-Day Moving Average: 27%14-Day Relative Strength Index: 54Why It Dropped: The world's largest movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has struggled in 2019 as box office results have been sluggish. Despite Avengers: Endgame becoming the best selling movie of all time, first half 2019 box office revenues were still down more than 9% year-over-year. Investors have interpreted this as further evidence that the movie theater industry is dying. AMC stock has consequently dropped to multi-year lows.  * 10 High-Flying, Overvalued Stocks in Danger of Crashing Why It Could Rebound: The movie theater industry isn't dead. Consumers still enjoy going to the movies because it's a fun experience. That's why annual ticket sales have bounced in the 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion tickets range for the past decade. First half 2019 was just a down period in that range. Second half 2019 is shaping up to be better. Month-to-date, box office revenues in July are up nearly 10% year-over-year. The upcoming releases of a new Frozen movie and a new Star Wars movie should allow this renewed growth to persist. As it does, AMC stock will bounce back. CVS (CVS)Source: Shutterstock % Off 52 Week High: 30%% Below 200-Day Moving Average: 12%14-Day Relative Strength Index: 50Why It Dropped: Shares of CVS (NYSE:CVS) have been under pressure for the past several years because the company's core fundamentals have consistently deteriorated. The retail pharmacy business has been hit by increasing competition, and the threat of Amazon entering the space and disrupting the whole industry. Meanwhile, the PBM business has been hit hard by adverse legislation, which has pressured sales, reach, margins and profits.Why It Could Rebound: The fundamentals in both the retail and PBM businesses could improve meaningfully over the next few months. On the retail side, industry-wide consolidation is easing competitive pressures, and the numbers at CVS have started to improve (3.8% gain in same-store sales last quarter, a 1.2% gain in front-store sales and 140 basis points of market share expansion). On the PBM side, U.S. President Donald Trump just agreed to scrap a proposed PBM rebate overhaul that would've presented a huge revenue and profit headwind for PBMs everywhere. Broadly, then, the trends underlying CVS are finally starting to improve, paving the path for a big rebound rally in CVS stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, AMZN, SHOP, ATVI, FL, NKE, TSLA, CGC, NFLX, AMC and CVS.

2019-07-26,"Buoyed by some strong earnings reports from technology companies and a solid second-quarter GDP reading, stocks rallied Friday, pushing toward more all-time highs.Economic growth in the U.S., the world's largest economy, slowed to 2.1% in the April through June quarter, but that topped economists' estimates calling for growth of 2%. That was a decent number, but still the lowest pace of economic growth since President Donald Trump took office.Trump took to Twitter to encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, saying second-quarter growth would have been better if borrowing costs were lower.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips&quot;Personal consumption expenditures rose 4.3%, the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2017. Government consumption expenditures and gross investment rose 5%, the fastest pace since Q2 of 2009 as the economy was coming out of the Great Recession,&quot; reports CNBC.Fueled by a big post-earnings rally in shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.11% today while the S&P 500 added 0.74%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled higher by 0.19%. Offense Through DefenseIn late trading, 18 of the Dow's 30 components were in the green with about half those names higher by close to or more than 1%.While it cannot be argued that more aggressive tech stocks powered the market higher today, several of the Dow's top performers on Friday were highly defensive names. In fact, the top four Dow stocks in terms of percentage gains would fit the bill as &quot;defensive.&quot;On light news flow, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which reported earnings earlier this week, was the Dow's top gainer today, adding 1.94%. The stock closed higher by about 4% this week. Earlier in the week, RBC analyst Nik Modi reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating on the stock while upping his price target by $4 to $60, implying decent upside from Friday's close.On light volume and news, consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) climbed 1.73%. PG's Friday gain could be a case of investors buying into the stock in advance of the July 30 earnings report. The company is expected to report a profit of $1.06 a share, up from 94 cents a year earlier.Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), one of the Dow's laggards this year, added 1.31% despite news that regulators are allowing T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) acquisition of Sprint (NYSE:S) to move forward. Those are the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers in the U.S. Their marriage creates a larger No. 3 behind Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T). Dow Jones' Repeat OffenderAmong the Dow losers today were several names that have made repeat appearances on the offenders list.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) and 3M (NYSE:MMM) are among them, but the index's worst performer today was Dow (NYSE:DOW).The chemicals producer slid 3.21% after a Bank of America research note out today said the stock is &quot;stuck in neutral&quot; and that pressure on the company's profits is likely to linger into the first half of next year. Dow Jones Today: Bottom LineNext week could bring plenty of excitement with another Federal Reserve meeting on tap. The prevailing reaction to Friday's GDP report was that while the number was a modest surprise, it was not so strong as to discourage the Fed from cutting rates.On the earnings front, the week starting July 29 is another busy one with about 26% of the S&P 500 reporting. At the sector level, technology and healthcare, the S&P 500's two largest sector weights, see about 30% of their components report. That is dwarfed by the 72.15% of energy companies reporting in the week ahead.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-07-29,"Dow (NYSE:DOW) delivered mediocre  second-quarter results on July 25, causing DOW stock to fall 3.8%. While the results weren't the worst in the world, they won't inspire many investors to buy Dow stock.  The ResultsSource: Shutterstock InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDow generated pro forma revenues of $11.01 billion in Q2, 14.3% lower than a year earlier. On a positive note, it only missed analysts' consensus estimate by $280 million or 2.5%On the bottom line, Dow's adjusted earnings per share came in at 86 cents, 39% lower than a year earlier, but in-line with analysts' consensus outlook.   * 7 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy for Your Inner Geek The official line from the company was that its sales volumes were 3% lower as a result of ongoing geopolitical uncertainties caused by the China-U.S. trade war and the slowing global economy.  Because of these issues, Dow cut its 2019 capital expenditure guidance by 20% to $2.0 billion. After the company's second quarterly report since its separation from DowDuPont, the question now is whether there's enough meat on the bone to attract buyers to Dow Inc. stock.  The Case for DOW StockThere is no question Dow is facing economic headwinds that won't be overcome in the near-term. That does make DOW stock less attractive.However, it's hard to ignore the fact that Dow's quarterly dividend of $0.70 currently yields an impressive 5.7%. Dow and its predecessor companies have now paid quarterly dividends for 431 straight quarters dating back to 1912.More importantly, DOW stock has the highest dividend yield of companies in the Dow Jones Industrial group. I'm not sure how investors who are concerned about generating income can ignore DOW stock.And investors should not be worried about its ability to pay its quarterly dividend. It paid out $517 million in dividends in Q2, just 38% of its $1.34 billion of free cash flow. As for its long-term debt, it had $17.2 billion as of June 30, representing 45% of the market cap of DOW stock. That's reasonable, given its strong free cash flow generation. At the end of the day,DOW stock has enough strength to keep raising investors' bottom lines.       The Case Against DOW StockInvesting is all about options. In the Dow Jones Industrial Average alone, there are 29 other stocks, some of which yield 3% or more and have  better capital appreciation potential than DOW stock. Also, some of these companies are in industries that aren't facing the same economic uncertainties at the moment. For those looking for a similar yield but better capital appreciation, I'd consider Chevron (NYSE:CVX), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The other problem with Dow is that its business is reasonably difficult to comprehend. Another InvestorPlace columnist, Josh Enomoto,  recently reflected on its complicated business model. &quot;Despite the much-covered DowDuPont breakup, Dow Inc stock doesn't provide a clean, linear path. Instead, the underlying company is stretched wide, featuring businesses in consumer products, packaging, industrial materials, large-scale infrastructures and technology,&quot; Josh wrote in a column published on June 11. Although Dow has three operating segments, it has six different business units, which means at any given time, one of those units could be underperforming, putting a drag on the entire company and on DOW stock.   The Bottom Line on DOW StockAlthough Dow Inc stock is facing headwinds at the moment, I believe that its overall financial strength provides investors with an excellent defensive play if the economy continues to worsen. Until the trade war is resolved, the owners of DOW stock will get paid 70 cents per share every quarter. That's a pretty good deal. At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The S&P 500 is challenging its all-time high once again today, the CBOE Volatility Index (INDEXCBOE:VIX) -- also known as the &quot;Fear Index&quot; -- is sitting just above 12 (which means fear is low among traders) and we're seeing stock after stock climb to new 52-week highs.This is an excellent market environment for us to jump back into some new put-write trades on stocks, like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), that have already reported earnings and have started moving higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Growth From New ProductsKO reported quarterly earnings on July 23, and it beat revenue estimates by $140 million and non-GAAP earnings estimates by $0.02 per share -- coming in at $10 billion and $0.63 per share, respectively.Management also said organic revenue grew by 6%, beating expectations of only 4% growth, and it reaffirmed its full-year earnings-per-share (EPS) expectations of $2.08-$2.10. Much of the company's growth came from new products, like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Costa Coffee, which is great news for a company that has been looking for ways to add to its dominant Coca-Cola and Diet Coke brands.As we've mentioned in recent recommendations, we generally like to avoid holding positions through earnings because stocks can be volatile. One look at KO's chart shows just how much a stock can jump after an earnings report. Ready to Move HigherKO completed a bullish &quot;wedge&quot; continuation pattern when it jumped up through long-term up-trending resistance after the earnings announcement. The stock has since established a new support level at $53 and appears ready to move higher. If KO had done poorly on earnings, we could have seen just as big a drop in the price.Daily Chart of Coca-Cola Company (KO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewBecause KO has already dropped down to retest the $53 level, we feel it would make a great strike price. This bullishness should last through the summer, and with earnings out of the way, we think later August expirations carry enough premium to justify holding the trade slightly longer.To find out which KO puts we're selling -- and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades -- consider signing up for risk-free trial subscription to Strategic Trader today.

2019-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- V. G. Siddhartha, the man who founded India’s biggest coffee chain more than a decade before Starbucks Corp. entered Asia’s third-largest economy, has died, police said.Siddhartha went missing on Monday after he went for a walk near a bridge close to the southern Indian city of Mangaluru. His body has been found, the city’s police commissioner Sandeep Patil said by phone on Wednesday. Patil didn’t elaborate.Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd., a company Siddhartha founded, on Tuesday released a letter purportedly written by him to the board about “succumbing to the situation” because of pressure from lenders, one of the private equity partners, and harassment by tax officials. Coffee Day’s external media representatives on Wednesday said they couldn’t immediately comment.The company’s shares plunged by the 20% limit in Mumbai. Siddhartha whose cafe network traces its roots to the IT hub of Bengaluru in 1996, didn’t return after telling his driver he was going for a walk on Monday.Siddhartha and other founders of Coffee Day pledged about 76% of their holdings as collateral, according to filings. The debt burden prompted him to start selling assets earlier this year. In April, he sold a 20% stake in software services firm Mindtree Ltd. to engineering giant Larsen & Toubro Ltd. He was seeking a valuation of as much as $1.45 billion from Coca-Cola Co. to sell a stake in Coffee Day, the Economic Times newspaper reported last month.“I gave it my all but today I gave up as I could not take any more pressure,” according to the letter dated July 27. The harassment by tax officials and pressure from lenders led to a “serious liquidity crunch.”The company is taking help from concerned authorities, and its leadership team will “ensure continuity of business,” Coffee Day said in an exchange filing on Tuesday.Shares of Sical Logistics Ltd., another company where Siddhartha’s family is a large investor, also plunged 20%. Sical had total debt of 11 billion rupees at the end of March, while loans at Coffee Day jumped 29% from a year earlier to 65.5 billion rupees, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Coffee Day went public in 2015, nearly two decades after opening its first cafe in Bengaluru, selling shares at 328 rupees apiece. A unit of private equity firm KKR & Co. owns 6.07% of the company, while Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys Ltd., has a 2.69% stake.Coffee Day has about 1,700 outlets, 10 times more than Starbucks runs in the nation, according to the National Restaurant Association of India.“We are deeply saddened by the developments and our thoughts are with his family at this time,” KKR said in an email. The fund sold 4.25% of its holding of about 10.3% last February and haven’t sold any shares before or since, according to the email.Siddhartha, who began his career as an investment banker, had sleepless nights when Starbucks entered India, according to an article he wrote for the Outlook magazine in 2016.He had a “miserable moment” when Coffee Days stock tanked at its debut, giving him “quite an ego blow,” he wrote in the column.&#92;--With assistance from P R Sanjai, Ari Altstedter, Ravil Shirodkar, Pradeep Kurup and Jeanette Rodrigues.To contact the reporters on this story: Anurag Kotoky in New Delhi at akotoky@bloomberg.net;Ameya Karve in Mumbai at akarve@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Arijit Ghosh, Ravil ShirodkarFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Body of India Coffee Tycoon Found as Letter Hints at Debt Woes

2019-08-02,"Business at Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) is complicated. And a recent earnings report may have clouded those prospects even more. But the trade of profiting from DOW stock is as straightforward as it gets for today's bullish investors looking past yesterday's news. Let me explain.Source: Shutterstock Dow's second quarterly confessional as a standalone, but highly complex company, didn't win it any new fans on Wall Street. The &quot;we-do-it-all&quot; style entity and one-third of the former DowDupont company announced mostly in-line, but decidedly weaker earnings and sales.By the numbers DOW stock offered a 39% profit drop on earnings of 86 cents. The good news? Earnings-per-share did match Street views. At the same time, sales slid by 14.3% and narrowly missed consensus forecasts by 2.5% on revenues of around $11 billion. Dow also reduced its 2019 CAPEX guidance by 20%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBehind the weak results, Dow's management cited, challenging conditions due to the U.S.-China trade war and a slowing global economy. Obviously, the blame is far from a surprise for DOW stock, which has three operating and six business units that have their hands in everything from infrastructure, packaging, consumer products and technology.Okay, but where does that leave Dow shareholders? Investors might take refuge in the fact the company remains a healthy and durable constituent of the Dow Industrials alongside the likes of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Disney (NYSE:DIS) or a JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).  * The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold But even better, DOW stock is offering today's investors a financially well-supported, steady and generous income stream of 5.79%. Additionally, as the payout is also built on a potentially sturdy-looking price chart, it's time to look past yesterday's news and buy shares today. DOW Stock Daily ChartThere was a time not so long ago when the price action in DOW stock was looking ominous as shares channeled their way to new lows. And truthfully, I was bearish at the time. But the underlying conditions have changed to afford a more optimistic outlook for Dow as an investment.A breakout of DOW's downtrend has gone on to establish a series of slightly higher highs and higher lows. This could be the start of a larger uptrend. Suffice it to say, that would be bullish for investors buying Dow shares today. With a favorable oversold condition in Dow's stochastics, buying on weakness looks even better.Be warned though, there is another way to read the DOW stock price chart, which also deserves attention.Investors could argue Dow is simply in another channel pattern that's simply flatter and precariously near the stock's all-time-lows. Obviously, it would be hard to disagree with that observation. It's also more of yellow flag cautioning against buying DOW stock.Further, given the formation's highs have been stymied between DOW stock's 38% and 50% retracement levels, this perspective could deserve more weight than the one eyeing an uptrend and a good spot to take advantage of capital appreciation and income.The bottom line? Both realities exist. It's also true investors taking on a position in Dow Inc can't have it both ways at the same time. So, if you're looking to buy DOW stock today, my recommended strategy is hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. And on today's price chart, that approach amounts to pretty straightforward business of risking a little to gain a lot.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-04,"The stock market has been shaken in recent days by an escalation of the trade battle with China, as well as a Federal Reserve move to lower benchmark interest rates for the first time since 2008 - but not by as much as some on Wall Street hoped. But even after heavy selling, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index remains just a few percent off all-time highs.Is this the start of a long-awaited stock market correction? Possibly. But rather than trying to gauge exactly when a correction is coming or what will spark it, a better plan is to simply prepare. That is, you can shift the composition of your portfolio so it can better weather a storm - but still profit as long as the bull keeps running.A more defensive posture does have drawbacks; nothing is free. The biggest problem is being underweight the stocks that are still driving the market higher. But for investors who do think a correction is coming and don't want to play the losing game of trying to time the market, we've asked a group of investment managers and other experts which stocks they expect to hold up should the market pull back.Here are 13 of the best stocks to buy to ride out a stock market correction.

2019-08-05,"There is no flowery language to adequately describe Monday's market action. Put simply, today was the worst day of 2019 for U.S. stocks.The Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.81% while the S&P 500 shed 3.27%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 3.23% as trade fears held investors hostage for another day.Before getting into the bloodbath, allow me to point out a not-so-fun fact. I have been penning the &quot;Dow Jones Today&quot; wrap up since late May. Regular readers know that I frequently point out something along the lines of &quot;20 of the Dow's stocks closed up/down today.&quot; Today was a first because, in late trading, all 30 Dow components were in the red and in most cases, deeply so.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is how bad things were for the Dow today: the index's two best performers last week were Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and those stocks lost 0.67% and 1.32% respectively, today.  * 10 Generation Z Stocks to Buy Long &quot;Of course, Coke generates a lot of revenue overseas--about 46% of its total sales--but no one expects people to stop drinking Coke (or the company's other beverages),&quot; reports Barron's. &quot;Verizon and Coke stocks yield 4.3% and 3.1%, respectively, better than the 2.3% average yield for stocks in the Dow.&quot; Trade Problems Equal Dow Tech WoesOn days like today, it is accurate to use the word &quot;unfortunate&quot; to describe the Dow's construction. Unfortunate because the index features no exposure to the real estate and utilities sectors, groups that are not export-dependent and that generate nearly all of their revenue in the U.S.The Dow is, however, heavily exposed to some cyclical sectors that are big exporters and vulnerable to trade wars, such as technology. Led by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which slipped 5.23%, all six of the Dow's tech components finished lower today. Underscoring how bad today was for tech stocks, the best-performing tech name in the Dow today was Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), shares of which tumbled 3.51%.With Apple being a bellwether stock, there was some analyst support out today for the iPhone maker.&quot;We believe Apple is more likely to absorb all the tariff impact and not raise prices on iPhone shipments and other hardware devices into the US, which we estimate will lead to a ~300 bps headwind to iPhone margins,&quot; said JPMorgan. Oil Stocks in the Dow Run DryWest Texas Intermediate futures slid almost 2% today, which was about the average loss for Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Oil and energy stocks are considered riskier assets and not suitable for days like today. More pressing (or depressing) for oil is the emergence of electric vehicles and alternative energy.In a note out today, Mark Lewis, global head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas, said &quot;the economics of renewables in tandem with EVs are set to become irresistible over the next decade.&quot; Dow Technical ConcernsYes, we're on the slower end of earnings season, but Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) reports tomorrow. That report could be taking on added significance because Disney stock closed below its 50-day moving average today for the first time since April.That's potentially bad news for multiple reasons, not the least of which is the fact that Disney stock has traded lower after six of the company's last eight earnings reports. Bottom Line on DJIAWhen I'm not writing the Dow Jones Today, I'm usually writing about ETFs, so I'm going to use that asset class to highlight what worked today and what should work if these trade tensions continue plaguing stocks.There are over 2,200 ETFs trading in New York, of which fewer than 400 closed higher today. Strip out the leveraged and inverse products, and that number declines considerably. What worked in terms of &quot;normal&quot; ETFs today were gold and other precious metals funds and bonds including treasuries (not surprising), corporate debt, municipal bonds, and some international sovereigns.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-07,"After opening lower in dramatic fashion, stocks steadily recouped those losses and grind higher in Wednesday's latter stages, providing short-term traders with the intraday volatility that they crave.Wednesday's action was very much a repeat of what investors have been dealing with in recent weeks: the trade war and speculation of another Federal Reserve rate cut prompted by, well, the trade war. Globally-inclined investors were treated to three rate cuts outside the U.S. today as India, New Zealand and Thailand joined the party.While yields on 30-year Treasuries hit record lows, helping U.S. stocks close well off the lows of the day. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 added 0.38% and 0.08%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.09%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOil tumbled today as the Energy Information Administration said domestic crude inventories surprisingly rose by 2.39 billion barrels last week, putting Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) among the blue-chip indexes losers for the day. Wednesday is just one day, but it is another sign of mounting pressure on traditional energy stocks.As I noted yesterday, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) is usually a weak performer immediately following its earnings reports. The entertainment giant unfortunately obliged today, sliding 4.92% to rank as the worst-performing Dow stock.The company earned $1.35 a share in its fiscal third quarter, 22% below analyst estimates. It was expected that this report would be messy for Disney. Sell-side analysts were out in force today supporting the stock, so this may be the pullback in Disney shares investors have been waiting for.Now, let's look at some winners. Quick Victory LapAdmittedly, the stock is down 5% over the past month, but The Travelers (NYSE:TRV), a name I've previously mentioned in this space, was one of the better-performing Dow stocks today, adding about 1%. Why bring up shares of Travelers today? Easy answer: the company generates little-to-no revenue outside the U.S. Yield PlayOn a light news day, shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) jumped 1.74%, making the stock today's top performer in the Dow. Bullishness in shares of the world's largest soft drink maker today could be simply a symptom. The stock has it and 10-year Treasuries don't have much of it. Earlier today, 10-year yields traded as low as 1.63%, well below Coca-Cola's dividend yield of 3.06%.I'm inclined to add Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) here because the stock rose 1.10% today. With a dividend yield of 2.61%, P&G isn't a high yielder, but is a storied dividend grower. That 2.61% is nearly 100 basis points better than what you'll get on 10-year Treasuries. Bad News Is Good NewsBig changes are afoot in the retail space and one of the cornerstones of that change is store closings. Such closures are not good news for the employees and the communities that depend on those locations, but Wall Street typically likes the news.Hence, Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) jumped 2% today after announcing it will shutter 200 U.S. stores. That move is expected to save the company $1.5 billion by 2022. Dow Jones Bottom LineThanks to the trade war, risk appetite is hibernating. Just look at the stocks mentioned above as Dow winners today. All defensive names.What else is working? Gold, which is defensive. Silver because gold is soaring, though the white metal is more volatile. And how about this fun fact: the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT), one of the least risky ETFs out there, is on a nine-day winning streak.

2019-08-07,"For a while last year, pot stocks like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) were all the rage on Wall Street. Everybody wanted to own CGC stock and its competitors. I couldn't avoid talking about it, not even at the gym.Source: Shutterstock But lately, Canopy Growth seems to have fallen off a cliff and it cannot find support.That's the risk of being a momentum stock like CGC: When things are going well, CGC stock is on a rocket ship to the moon. Conversely, when things go sour and they fall out of grace they plummet into an abyss. This makes it very difficult to trade.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThis is why homework is important and fundamentals have to be part of the thesis. The good news for CGC stock is that it has fallen into a pivotal support zone.When it comes to cannabis stocks, CGC is the cream of the crop at least this is what perception is for most sector investors. This is perhaps due to the fact that Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) invested more than $4 billion into the CGC. This served as a due diligence by proxy to most retail investors who may or may not have as good of an insight into the cannabis industry but still want to participate in it.This year, new issues like Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and unicorns like Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) stole the pot stock thunder. So in essence, we have had a flood of speculative bets competing with cannabis stocks for the same pool of money.While this makes bounces and Canopy Growth stock harder to come by, this does not mean that the story is over. CGC Stock Is a Buy at SupportThe cannabis industry is still a viable bet for the future. There is just too much love for and interest in it that it will take a lot more than a few dim trading months to reverse it. CGC stock ranks at the top of that list of stocks to own.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale Most mega consumer companies are still interested in entering it if not for the legal hurdles. Perhaps most are still waiting for the United States to legalize cannabis on the federal level. So far, it has been only states that have legalized marijuana, but the trend is growing. Once the regulatory hurdles fall, the pot stocks fundamentals will change drastically.Therein lies a put below pot stock prices themselves. Meaning they have already shed a lot of their initial froth. And for them to fall much lower will take headline setbacks that are not yet on the docket.Moreover, the cannabis thesis has a wide scope of applications. So it is near impossible to kill it altogether right here. Beverage companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) are itching to launch a cannabis-based drink; beauty companies want to sell creams with CBD; food companies want to offer edibles right off of the supermarket shelves.This is not to mention the huge array of medical applications.The potential is vast and the problem for Canopy Growth stock now is whether the company can deliver on its promises. It needs to step up like Aphria (NYSE:APHA) just did and deliver a good report. So far, the whole cohort like Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) and Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) have been given a pass on that front, but they need to start filling the gaps between expectations and realities.Specifically, pot stocks need to show more production capacity. They cannot make enough of the stuff to satisfy the current demand let alone growth. When that happens, it's then only a matter of time before they align their operations to satisfy the demand and thereby grow into their valuations.Speaking of valuations … they are insane. There is no way to justify the current metrics of CGC stock selling at a 66 times its sales while losing $2 per share. But it is important to note that these are intrepid stocks trying to legitimize an industry that didn't even exist just a few months ago on Wall Street. So they are supposed to spend a lot in the beginning. It is important to not discount the potential in them just because of profitability.  * 10 Stocks to Buy on the Trade War Dip Nevertheless, these are risky stocks and I would consider going long CGC or any other cannabis stock a speculative bet at best. Sizing of any trades in them should be small enough to not break the piggy bank. This also leaves room for adding at lower prices if the need arises.In addition, the stock market in general is still reeling from that huge shake up in the economic war between the U.S. and China. So there's unusual added risk from outside factors.As always, when it comes to any stock, I suggest that you never invest more than you are willing to lose.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-08-07,"Bellicose words and hawkish trade policy have turned into a larger skirmish in the simmering trade war. US President Trump on Thursday tweeted that he would impose new tariffs on Chinese imports starting September 1. The tariffs, set at 10% on some $250 billion in Chinese products, will target consumer goods, including electronics. In response, China allowed the yuan to drop past 7 to the dollar – its weakest in over a decade – a reversal of the government’s usual policy of currency support. China’s government shrugged off Trump’s accusations of currency manipulation, and in today’s trading has set the yuan at a slightly stronger rate.Markets, of course, have reacted, with the Dow Jones losing 5.4% and the S&P 500 losing 5.6% between July 30 and August 5. Both indexes showed modest gains on August 6, and still show strong gains year-to-date.Here, we’ll look at four stocks well-positioned to weather trade-war induced volatility. All are buy-rated, all have recently beaten their earnings estimates, and top analysts have noted paths forward for each of them. And all four fit one of Warren Buffett’s favorite criteria for choosing stocks: “Only invest in simple businesses that you understand.” Coca-Cola Company (KO)We’ll start with the world’s most recognized soft drink, Coca-Cola. Coke is definitely a simple business, in the sense that Buffett meant; even though it markets more than 500 branded products, the company has kept its product line focused steadfastly on bottled beverages. By keeping strictly to a sector it knows and does well, Coke has built a powerful brand and a loyal customer base.On July 23, the company reported 63 cents EPS, beating the forecast by 1.6%. Reported revenues, $10 billion, were just above the expected $9.99 billion. KO shares broke above $54 after the earnings release, and still remains near that all-time high. Year-to-date, KO is up 10.4%.Writing after the earnings report, William Chappell of SunTrust Robinson noted the earnings beat and rising revenues, and said, “The company's strong organic sales trends will continue for the balance of the year based on its anticipated investments and momentum in its markets, with more benign FX conditions in 2020 also relieving some of the headwinds of 2019.” He boosted his price target to $60, to go along with his Buy rating. His target indicates confidence in a 14% upside for KO.RBC Capital’s Nik Modi also sees strength in KO, writing, “The company is executing well against its strategy to becoming a total beverage company—driving both organic revenue and earnings per growth.” Modi sees the company’s near- to mid-term earnings growth remaining in the mid- to high-single digit range. In line with this upbeat outlook, he sets a $60 target on the stock.Overall, Coke’s stock maintains a Moderate Buy rating, based on an even split of 6 buys and 6 holds over the past three months. The current share price is $52.27; as mentioned above, this is close to the stock’s all-time high. The average price target, $57.18, suggests an upside of 9.39% for KO. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)The consumer health giant offers us an interesting study. It’s a market leader in home health products, and also manufactures a variety of prescription drugs. Both business segments are profitable and tend to outperform the market; yet JNJ is only up 1.33% year-to-date, and the stock has slipped 7% since mid-July. The company’s fortunes are balanced between last month’s strong second-quarter earnings and a series of legal actions that have investors worried.For Q2, JNJ reported a 4.8% earnings beat, with EPS of $2.58 per share against the forecast $2.46. This was a 42% year-over-year gain. Revenues were also beat expectations, by 1.3%, and came in at $20.56 billion for the quarter. That was the good news.The bad news – the legal worries – concerns a set of ongoing issues, on the company’s talcum powder and possible liability exposure to the opioid epidemic, that have been dogging JNJ since last year. Investors are concerned based on the size of potential judgements against the company. BMO analyst Joanne Wuensch addressed the legal cases in her review of the stock two months ago. She said, “Litigation is a common occurrence in the health care sector that takes significant time to resolve, and often headlines are worse than reality.” Believing that JNJ has plenty of underlying strength to fall back on, she gives the stock a $157 price target and a 20% upside.Five-star analyst Jayson Bedford, writing from Raymond James, agrees with Wuensch’s assessment of JNJ stock. He says, “There is still plenty of drama ahead for Johnson & Johnson investors in the near term, but the company has solid fundamentals and the stock has an attractive valuation.” While upbeat, Bedford’s price target is more cautious, at $146, but still implies an upside of 11.6%.While Johnson & Johnson shows the most near-term weakness of the stocks in this list, it also shows the highest longer-term potential. JNJ shares have a 15% upside, based on a share price of $130 and an average price target of $151. The moderate buy rating is based on 4 buys and 3 holds from the past three months. Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW)Best known for its line of paints, Sherwin-Williams is the leading provider of paints and coating for the industrial and construction sectors. The company pleased investors and analysts last month, when its Q2 EPS of $6.57 beat the forecast by 3.5%. The beat was especially welcome after SHW missed earnings in the previous quarter.Wall Street’s analysts were quick to pick up on SHW’s performance. Writing from RBC Capital, Arun Viswanathan said, “The quarter was driven by strong execution in its North America retail market and a favorable backlog of delayed projects. The company's comps growth of 4.3% topped our forecast of 3% thanks to the higher sales volume and an increase in selling prices.” Viswanathan increased his price target by 6.3%, to $550, indicating a 10% upside for SHW.Susquehanna analyst Don Carson looked at Sherwin-Williams’ forward potential, and wrote, “We have increased confidence in the outlook for strong earnings growth in 2020 given strong Paint Stores Group sales growth in the face of adverse weather which underscores the potential for further margin expansion from falling raw material costs.” Carson’s $580 price target suggests a 16% upside potential for the stock.SHW’s analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy is based on 7 buys and 4 holds assigned in recent months. Shares are pricey, at $498, but the high share price means the modest dividend yield of 0.91% pays out $4.52 per share annualized. The average price target, $531, implies a 6.58% upside for this stock. Waste Management, Inc. (WM)Our last stock here is also probably the strongest on this list. Waste Management’s 30% year-to-date gain is more than double the S&P 500’s 15%. In addition, Waste Management has consistently beaten the quarterly earnings expectations, and its last report was no exception. The $1.11 EPS was 3.7% higher than the $1.07 forecast, and the $3.95 billion in quarterly revenue was significantly higher than the year-ago quarter’s $3.74 billion.Waste Management’s secret to consistent outperformance is in its name: the company is North America’s largest provider of garbage collection and recycling services. Like Johnson & Johnson, Waste Management leads in a business segment that will always have ready customers. It is a classic defensive stock.The markets top analysts were predictably upbeat after the earnings report. Two analysts – Patrick Brown, from Raymond James, and Derek Spronck, from RBC Capital – both issued increased price targets for WM. Brown raised his to $127, and Spronck set his at $126. At the same time, Scotiabank analyst Mark Neville opened coverage on the stock, with a Buy rating and an aggressive price target of $130. Neville’s target implies an upside potential of 12% for WM shares.The analyst consensus on WM is a Moderate Buy. The stock has received 4 buys and 2 holds in the past three months. Shares are selling for $116, so the $124 price target gives them an upside of 7.3%.",4 Defensive Stocks to Weather Trade-War Volatility

2019-08-08,"Over the last year Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has done better for investors than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Source: Shutterstock Walmart shares are up over 20% and sport a dividend of 53 cents, currently better than what you get on a 10-year government bond. Amazon is down 5% and has no dividend.Thanks to 2018's heavy investments in technology, investors are now paying almost 38 times last year's earnings for Walmart, which next reports August 15. Amazon sells for 75 times earnings, but it's growing 20% per year, while Walmart is growing at 3% per year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates Analysts expect Walmart to earn $1.21 per share on revenue of $130.5 billion and are hoping for $1.25. Keep that up and it has a price to earnings ratio of 21.6, better but still high for a retailer.Why does everyone love Walmart stock? WMT Stock Beating Amazon?For many investors, Walmart represents safety. The company delivers slow, steady growth. Walmart is a bet on the American consumer. Its sales are over $515 billion, its market cap $319 billion.Investors believe consumers will accept the cost of China tariffs and keep buying at Walmart. Walmart represents almost 10% of the entire U.S. retail market. How people buy may change, but analysts believe Walmart is staying on top of the changes. It's experimenting with mini-stores that are just online pickup windows. E-commerce sales up 37% year-over-year. Walmart is even seeking a cryptocurrency patent.Never mind that online sales are mostly cannibalizing in-store revenue, or that revenue is still growing at that steady 3%, or that Walmart continues to lose money in e-commerce. Walmart isn't beating Amazon, but there's truthiness in the idea that it is.Analysts feel it's true, that it's at least competitive. Walmart insists it's growing in e-commerce, but it massages that message carefully for analysts, so investors buy it.The assumption is that, in a rapidly changing retail environment, Walmart is on top of things. But is it? The Gun ProblemWalmart is America, as much as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are America. Is America on top of things?Walmart is America's downtown. It faces all the urban problems other downtowns face. This includes the problem of violence.The shooting at an El Paso store that killed 22, while especially horrific, was not as aberrant as it seemed. Two people were shot to death at a Mississippi Walmart just a week before. A man was shot to death in a Walmart parking lot in California on August 7. That same day, a man threatened to shoot up a Walmart in Alabama. This was two days after another man threatened to open fire at a store in Florida.Walmart stopped selling assault-type rifles in 2015, but some employees now want it to stop selling guns entirely.  Walmart, like it or not, has been moved to the center of national debate.  Another Way for WMT StockThere are other ways to get Walmart's results in your portfolio without Walmart's risks.One way is with Kroger (NYSE:KR). I've written about them before. Kroger had sales of $121 billion in 2018, but its market cap is just $19.5 billion. Kroger's 16 cent per share dividend represents a yield of 2.88%. Last year's earnings were five times higher than that dividend.Kroger gets no respect because it's not just one thing. Kroger has 17 names on its stores, so its moves to make money with online sales don't get much attention.None of this is to say you should do what I have done and buy Kroger. It's just that Walmart stock is not the only way to play retail growth.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2019-08-13,Coca-Cola's Dasani brand is the latest company pitching bottled water to gothe aluminum can route,Aluminum packaging is coming for your water as Coca-Cola&#039;s Dasani brand takes the plunge
2019-08-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. is putting its Dasani water brand into aluminum cans as the beverage industry faces pressure to reduce its use of plastic.Coke will start selling canned Dasani in the U.S. Northeast next month, with plans to expand the product to other parts of the country in 2020. The announcement comes after PepsiCo Inc. said recently it would experiment with selling Aquafina, its mainstream water brand, in cans at restaurants and stadiums.Beverage giants are under pressure to boost recycling and cut down on plastic that’s filling the world’s oceans and waterways. Aluminum cans generally contain more recycled material than plastic bottles and are less likely to float away in the ocean. Dasani and Aquafina are the top two bottled brands in the U.S., with combined sales north of $2 billion.In addition to the can test, Coke is unveiling a new “hybrid” Dasani bottle, with the half of the materials from a combination of plants and recycled plastic. The company also said it’s cutting down on the weight of its bottles in a bid to use less material.The initiatives are designed to appeal to customers and help Coke meet its pledge to boost the use of recycled material by 2030. Lauren King, Dasani’s brand director, said the efforts will also help boost profit at the parent company.“Overall this is good for our bottom line,” King said.To contact the reporter on this story: Craig Giammona in New York at cgiammona@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Anne Riley Moffat at ariley17@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder, Kevin MillerFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Coke Putting Dasani Water in Cans Amid Backlash Against Plastic
2019-08-13,"Editor's note: &quot;5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.If you're like me, the current bout of trade-induced volatility isn't sitting too right. And while swings and bear markets are a part of investing, the kind of big plunges we've recently seen does make for some sleepless nights. Which is why the best stocks to buy could be America's blue-chip stocks.Blue-chip stocks don't necessarily have a formal definition, but they are generally stable and well-established companies. Blue-chip stocks are typically household names with billions in revenues and steady rising profit profiles. Often, they share the wealth with their investors via rich dividend and buyback programs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The best part is that investors can count on blue-chip stocks to help them get through periods of malaise and bear markets as they tend to be less volatile than let's say, smaller growth stocks. To that end, with the markets starting to feel a bit shaky, blue-chip stocks could be the best way to position your portfolio in the upcoming months.But which blue-chip stocks make sense to buy? Here are five that could help you get through the next few months and an upcoming bear market. Cisco Systems (CSCO)The technology sector is often seen as a growth element for a portfolio. However, the sector does feature plenty of blue-chip stocks that produce mountains of cash flows, steady dividends, and rising profits. Case in point, former dot-com darling Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).Source: Shutterstock After building the internet and networking with its focus on switching gear and routers, CSCO made the smart pivot into services and reoccurring revenues. It basically created the model that many tech firms have copied.And in doing that, Cisco has become a cash generation machine. Last quarter alone, the firm managed to produce more than $3.5 billion in free cash flows.The best part is that CSCO continues to share that cash with investors. The firm recently raised its dividend by 6% and added another $15 billion to its authorized buyback program.And yet, more could be in store for Cisco. The firm continues to add new capabilities to its services platform and recently unveiled new conversational A.I. to its interfaces. Adding in continued data center demand as well as the pending 5G upgrades and Cisco continues to look great.For investors looking for a strong tech sector blue-chip stock, Cisco has to be your top pick. Merck (MRK)The steadfastness of the healthcare sector makes it a prime place to find plenty of blue-chip stocks. And one of the best could be pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE:MRK).For starters, MRK features a wide portfolio of current and former blockbuster drugs, vaccines and other therapies. This huge portfolio continues to drive profits and cash flows at the giant. But MRK isn't resting on its laurels. A few years ago, Merck made the shift into newer biotech and advanced cancer-fighting medications. That has turned out to be the right move.MRK's Keytruda has quickly become the go-to medicine for a variety of lung cancers and sales going through the roof. Last quarter alone, the company reported more than $2.2 billion in Keytruda sales.That double-digit growth has allowed Merck to up its total forecast and guidance for the entire year.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now The growth of Keytruda could continue. Merck has begun several trials looking to use the drug in other indications. This could provide even more cash flowing Merck's way. Considering the growth of its cancer portfolio and the rest of its steady drug options, Merck is looking like a great buy for the long haul.In the end, MRK's 2.5% yield and continued growth make it a powerful blue-chip stock for any investor. American Express Company (AXP)One of Warren Buffett's favorite blue-chip stocks happens to be American Express (NYSE:AXP). And the Oracle of Omaha isn't wrong to own it. The financial powerhouse has continued to thrive in the rising economy and has a lot to offer investors.Source: Shutterstock AXP is kind of a weird bird. Like its rivals, Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) (two blue-chip stocks also worth owning), American Express operates a secured payment network and acts as a toll road when customers swipe their cards. Here, Amex scores a hefty fee.The firm's discount revenue rate was last quarter was 2.37%. Basically, for every $100 spent on its cards, $2.37 flowed back to AXP. All in all, last quarter, American Express pulled in more than $6.2 billion in revenue from these operations.Secondly, unlike V and MA, American Express is an issuer of its cards. Because of this, it's able to score hefty membership fees, interest and creates a leverage effect for its profits. Moreover, Amex's entire M.O. is about rewards and its partners pay the credit issuer plenty of fees to get their products/offers onto AXP's platform.The best part is that AXP tends to focus on the higher end of the credit spectrum. This removes many of the uncertainty and issues with offering loans and reduces default rates.All of this has made American Express a powerhouse in the financial sector. Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Sixty-three years. That's an amazing streak for any firm to consistently raise its dividend. But for blue-chip stock Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC), it's just par for the course. The secret lies with the firm's massive and irreplaceable moat.Source: Shutterstock There's a good chance that you've never walked into one of GPC's locations, but your mechanic has. Under the NAPA banner, the firm operates one of the largest networks of auto parts and industrial distribution locations in the nation.Those 9,250 locations are located pretty much everywhere, and that's key. Auto parts are generally a &quot;need it now&quot; sort of item and are pretty much immune from the whims of online sales.Because of this huge network, GPC and NAPA are pretty much the only game in town when it comes to getting parts to body shops, mechanics and service centers. This has been beyond good for GPC's bottom line over the years. In its 90-year history, sales have increased in 85 of those years.  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What This streak was continued last year as GPC recorded more than $18.7 billion in revenues. Analysts predict that revenues will jump by about 4% this year. Naturally, those sales have turned into profits and a long streak of dividend increase for investors.This consistency has made GPC one of the best blue-chip stocks to own for the long haul. Coca-Cola (KO)When it comes to blue-chip stocks, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) could be the bluest. Its brand is worldwide and is enjoyed millions of times daily. This has allowed KO to pay a constantly rising dividend for the last 55 years and provide plenty of ballast to a portfolio in markets just like today.Source:  Chris Nielsen via FlickrAnd there is still growth to be had.Coke has moved into new beverage categories as tastes have changed. Sparkling water, juices, teas, and other healthy drinks are now on a menu at the firm.And these items continue to grow, with revenues for these products now accounting for about half of KO's total pie. Meanwhile, KO has improved margins via new packaging designs and sizes. Adding in some tech -- such as its Arctic Coolers and Freestyle machines -- and Coke seems to be winning the beverage wars.The proof is in the pudding. Continued product mix development has resulted in a big 5% jump in revenues last quarter. Likewise, earnings saw a big surge and KO has managed to produce roughly $6.28 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.Yes, KO is boring. But that's what exactly what investors should be looking for in a blue-chip stock. Consistency, with a touch of growth.

2019-08-14,"It was a wicked Wednesday as stocks tumbled amid mounting concerns that some major global economies, including the U.S., are flirting with recessions. Adding to the recession concerns, there was another instance of yield curve inversion today.For those not familiar with the vernacular, yield curve inversion is an instance of 10-year Treasury yields dipping below those on 2-year notes. This has happened several times this year. Over the course of history, such inversions have proven to be reliable harbingers of looming economic contraction.Speaking of contracting, that's exactly what Germany's economy, the Eurozone's largest, is doing which adds to risk-off pall cast over global equity markets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul &quot;Germany's economy shrank 0.1 percent from April through June and has been treading water for the last year, the government's official statistics agency said. Analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted that the economy will shrink during the current quarter as well, meeting the technical definition of a recession,&quot; reports The New York Times.Here in the U.S., the Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.02% while the S&P 500 sank nearly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.05%.In the category of &quot;what a difference a day makes,&quot; yesterday I had the privilege of saying that all 30 Dow stocks traded higher. Today, I'm sad to report that in late trading, all 30 Dow components were in the red. Dow Winners In Short SupplyToday was one of those days when it's more about highlighting the best of the worst Dow stocks, not the biggest winners, because there weren't any winners to speak of. In late trading, just five Dow members were sporting losses of less than 1%.One of those names was Walmart (NYSE:WMT). The nation's largest retailer reports earnings tomorrow and in what could prove to be some much-needed good news, analysts are speculating that if Walmart beats, it could boost guidance.&quot;E-commerce sales performance in the U.S. will be closely watched. Telsey Advisory estimates a 37% year-over-year gain, which would match the first-quarter growth. Bank of America is looking for a 35% advance, and Tesley predicts a rise of at least 30%,&quot; according to Bloomberg. &quot;In addition, analysts may have lingering questions around tariffs, even as the Trump administration said Tuesday it will delay until mid-December the 10% tariff on some Chinese products.&quot;I recently explored the long-term potential of Walmart's e-commerce efforts here. Consumer Staples Hold UpAs for the other members of today's least-bad group, a couple of those were consumer staples names, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Given the risk-off tenor to the day, it wasn't surprising to see these stocks hold up, relatively speaking.However, there may another force at play. Historical data suggest that after yield curve inversion, the best-performing sectors are utilities and consumer staples. However, those historical anecdotes are not always all-encompassing. Just look at Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), shares of which slid 5.01% today. Dow Warning SignsCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) reports earnings after the bell today, but some investors departed the name in advance of that report as highlighted by the stock's 4% tumble today. Laboring around the $50-$51 area, this report is critical for Cisco's near-term fortunes. A move to the mid-$40s seems almost as likely as jump to the mid-$50s.There is also growing sentiment that McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the Dow's best stock in August and one of the index's top performers this year, could be ready to decline, but that seems to be a technical bet, not a commentary on the stock's underlying fundamentals. DJIA Bottom LineI cannot confirm that a recession is imminent and it should be noted that the yield curve inversion, while reliable, is not 100% accurate. Nor am I glossing over the weakness in stocks, but historical data also confirm that the third quarter (August in particular) is usually unkind to equities.Perhaps the best strategy for the rest of this month and into September is to keep some cash on the sidelines and wait for more attractive opportunities to come available, particularly if the best defensive sectors can do is decline less than their high beta counterparts.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In a free-market economy everyone is supposed to have the chance to get rich. The dream of making it big motivates people to take risks, start businesses, stay in school and work hard. Unfortunately, in the U.S., that dream seems to be dying.There are still plenty of rich people in the U.S., and their wealth is increasing. But people outside that top echelon are having a tougher time breaking in. A 2017 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland found that the probability that a household outside the top 10% made it into the highest tier within 10 years was twice as high during 1984-1994 as it was during 2003-2013.There surely are many reasons for this trend, but one of them probably is the winner-take-all structure of the U.S. economy, where a few people get fabulously lucky with their hedge fund or tech startup, while most people fail.The traditional way to get rich in America is to start a business. For those of modest means, perhaps this would be a corner store or a restaurant; for the more ambitious, a technology startup. Many Americans still do this, but the number is dropping as business formation dries up:Much of the decline is due to efficient national retail chains muscling out small local businesses. But high-growth startups are on the wane as well, and the dominance of a few giant tech companies may be making it harder for upstarts to reach the loftiest heights of success.If you don’t start your own business, you can always invest in someone else’s. Investors who put their money into winning stocks like  Coca-Cola Co. or Amazon.com Inc. made fortunes. But turning a small amount of money into a large amount in the market requires making big -- and remarkably lucky -- bets on individual stocks. Most people who try to do this end up failing. For the average American, the market is a bewildering game, full of high-frequency traders and savvy hedge funds waiting to take their money; decades of painful experience have taught individual investors that day trading is a losing bet. Most simply turn over their money to institutions, accepting the more modest but less risky returns they offer.Middle-class Americans tend to have most of their wealth in houses. For the average person, real estate is a comprehensible game, where assets are tangible and visible, and market transactions often are done face-to-face. From the 1980s through the early 2000s, many Americans tried to get rich by buying and selling second and third homes. But the housing bubble, which largely was driven by this sort of activity, crushed the real estate dream for many. Others who bought only one home saw it plunge in value in the crash; those that were forced to sell their houses, usually to better-heeled buyers, were unable to recoup their losses when prices eventually recovered.After the recession, lending standards tightened, making it harder for people of modest means to get in on the real-estate market and start building wealth. House flipping has returned, but homeownership rates have fallen, suggesting that one of the main paths to accumulating assets is no longer readily available to those of lesser means. For the middle rungs of the distribution, wealth -- most of which is in housing -- has barely recovered from the devastation of the late 2000s:Even if one doesn’t win big in the housing or stock markets, it is possible to get moderately wealthy by working one’s way up the corporate ladder. And companies are still throwing big salaries at data scientists with doctorates, as well as executives and top managers. But hopping on the bottom rungs of the ladder usually requires an elite and very costly education. Sometimes this even means an advanced degree. That kind of credential can only be attained by way of not just talent, but increasingly a privileged background. Stories like that of former Salomon Brothers Vice Chairman Lewis Ranieri, who started off working in the mail room and ended up as the inventor of mortgage-backed bonds, are probably getting rarer.Plenty of Americans are still starting successful businesses, picking winning stocks, flipping houses for handsome profits and polishing their resumes for top employers. But those paths to wealth have gotten narrower, more difficult and less certain. With the rise of big companies, institutional investors, tight lending standards and degree requirements, an American’s chances of making a fortune without either being a genius or having wealthy parents look slimmer than ever. It’s small wonder that so many have flocked to the world of cryptocurrency, where outsiders and people with less formal education still have a chance to strike it rich. Even there, though, institutional investors are slowly taking over.If the free-wheeling, free-market system of the 20th century really has hardened into an oligarchy in the 21st, it could foreshadow collapsing trust in institutions -- some of which we've already seen -- and political instability. Without the promise that bold risk-taking and/or hard work can make them rich, what will young Americans do with their restless ambition? Many will keep working hard and be willing to accept the paltry returns, but an increasing number will turn against the system itself. Don’t be surprised if socialism, or other anti-capitalist ideologies, becomes the next hot growth industry.To contact the author of this story: Noah Smith at nsmith150@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-08-16,"Does stock market volatility have you ready to toss in the towel? My advice is use it to your advantage with IPO stocks Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) and Luckin Coffee (NASDAQ:LK), where growth has quickly met up with value on the price chart. Let me explain.It's hard to keep up with the broader market's day-to-day gyrations. Wall Street swings from triumphant cheers to worrisome jeers and vice versa. From weak global economic data spooking investors to applause for the delay on levying tariffs on certain Chinese goods, it's hard to keep up with the headlines.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On More importantly, please don't forget the names Pinterest, Beyond Meat and Luckin Coffee. One of these stocks could be the next Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or even Starbuck's (NASDAQ:SBUX). Bottom line, in today's wild trading environment these three recent IPO stocks are providing investors the opportunity to buy into big-time growth potential at advantageous prices.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips IPO Stock to Buy No. 1: Pinterest (PINS)PINS stock is the first of our recent IPO stocks to buy. The super popular web-based visual discovery platform blasted past earnings views and collectively caught investors' eyes as shares exploded higher by nearly 19% in early August.Technically, just over two weeks after reporting and with lots of market turbulence in between, PINS stock has pulled back approximately by 10% from a classic cup-with-handle pattern breakout attempt. This came after scoring fresh all-time highs.It's easy to blame overall market action for the first failure in this IPO stock. Ultimately, it hasn't been a great environment for buying breakouts. But with PINS stock still holding its own technically, there's reason to believe a second attempt will pay investors handsomely. PINS Stock TradeThe recommendation for PINS stock is to put shares on the radar for buying on a breakout above $35.30. That's only likely to occur if the major averages can rally for more than a day and begin to show more convincing signs of bottoming.A second approach for this IPO stock is to buy shares on weakness. I'd recommend looking for a daily chart pivot low to form. Then buy PINS stock on confirmation of a bottom. In order to keep this purchase technically constructive, I'd also make sure the PINS stock price consolidation continues to hold near $31 a share. IPO Stock to Buy No. 2: Beyond Meat (BYND)Beyond Meat is the second of our recent IPO stocks to watch. The alternative, plant-based meats company served up a sizzling, but not &quot;meaty&quot; enough, earnings report a couple weeks ago and word of a below-the-market secondary priced at $160 a share. The combination of reports didn't sit well with Wall Street.Technically, investors immediately punished shares, quickly dismantling BYND stock's uptrend line in free-fall-style price action. Subsequent pressure now has this first-to-market innovator testing its 50% Fibonacci level for support. BYND Stock TradeWhen will the selling pressure in this IPO stock abate? It's hard to know. But given that BYND stock is now well beneath the secondary pricing and testing a key retracement level, this deep pullback is worth monitoring for a bottom to emerge.  * 10 Stocks Under $5 to Buy for Fall My advice is for investors to wait for a weekly reversal candlestick to be confirmed before entering into a long position. With this strategy, bulls will give up some immediate profit in this highly volatile IPO stock. More importantly, the approach should allow investors to buy growth at a discount and avoid being grilled for entering too quickly. IPO Stock to Buy No. 3: Luckin (LK)Luckin Coffee is the last of our IPO stocks that's setting up to buy. I'll credit InvestorPlace's Luke Lango for alerting me to this China-based upstart and its promising path to substantial longer-term returns for investors.It's true, Luckin Coffee does have its work cut out for it. The company is competing against the aforementioned coffee powerhouse Starbucks, which has already successfully penetrated this massive overseas market. But still, the opportunity is there. And as Luke notes, with a solid technology-based focus and an eye-popping sales growth runway that's affirming this IPO stock's toehold is working, LK stock is one to pick up on weakness. LK Stock TradeLK stock is testing its 50% and 62% Fibonacci levels and its lower Bollinger Band. Shares are also oversold based on the position of its stochastics indicator. However, this week's earnings-driven breakdown of trend support shouldn't be entirely dismissed. It could be a slippery path to retest this IPO stock's all-time-low near $14 a share. Anything is possible.My recommendation on LK stock is to wait for a daily chart bottoming candle to be confirmed if shares can maintain a bid above $18.75. This allows for a modest bit of wiggle room beneath the 62% level. That also respects exiting the position on a more convincing failure of this key technical support in anticipation of a more durable purchase at deeper and well-chilled levels of investor anxiety.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management currently own positions in Pinterest (PINS) and its derivatives, but no other securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-16,"It could have been worse. At one point on Thursday, the S&P 500 was down as much as 0.5% before rallying back to end the session up a quarter of a percent. Investors entertained doubts about the idea that the recent yield curve inversion has to lead to a recession.Source: Shutterstock Walmart (NYSE:WMT) gets the bulk of the credit for yesterday's gain. Shares of the retailer jumped more than 60% after the company delivered second-quarter numbers that exceeded expectations. E-commerce revenue remains particularly impressive for the world's biggest retailer.Yet, though the broad market made gains, the number of advancers was only slightly higher than the number of decliners, and bearish volume was actually greater than buying volume.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWeighing stocks back more than any other name was General Electric (NYSE:GE), down more than 11% on accusations that it has been doctoring its accounting statements in a way that covers up a great number of liabilities that will cost the company billions. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) plunged nearly 9% after serving up lackluster guidance stemming from the tariff war underway with China.  * 10 Cheap Dividend Stocks to Load Up On As the last trading day of the week kicks off, however, it's the stock charts of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) that merit the closest looks. Here's why. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)Although most stocks bounced back from recent weakness on Thursday, it's not surprising that Freeport-McMoRan didn't. Shares have been trapped in a downtrend for years, and that selloff was renewed at the beginning of last year when a rising support line was snapped.It's possible, however, yesterday's 4% tumble may have also served as a capitulation that ends up becoming the low point of the current bearish swing. That dip pulled the stock back to an established floor, forcing the bulls and the bears -- if not both -- to finally make a commitment.  *   Click to EnlargeAlthough you have to go back to 2017 to see the initial low that serves as the first node of a falling support line, plotted in blue on both stock charts, it's clear that FCX has been getting pushed toward the tip of a converging wedge pattern.  * The weekly chart also indicates Freeport-McMoRan shares broke below what had been a technical floor at $9.50, marked in yellow on the weekly chart that also plots the rising support line, in red, that snapped in the middle of last year to let a new pullback take shape.  * Although technically weak and suffering from bearish momentum, Thursday's kiss of the lower boundary of a descending wedge pattern opens the door to the possibility FCX could attempt to rebound from here. The upper boundary of the wedge, in white, remains intact though. Microsoft (MSFT)Giving credit where it's due, Microsoft shares have impressively stood up to marketwide weakness that started to seriously undermine other stocks late last month. Since peaking in July, MSFT shares have only fallen less than 6%. The S&P 500 is also still decidedly below most of its key moving average lines, while Microsoft is still above its key lines, or only modestly below the ones it's under.Microsoft shares are slowly slipping into a funk, however, putting pressure on key support levels, and failing to find support at others. One, perhaps two, more bearish days could push MSFT over the proverbial cliff and pull the rug out from underneath this name that has rallied about as far as it can feasibly go for the time being.  * 15 Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Haul   *   Click to EnlargeThe key floor now under attack is the straight-line span connecting February's, June's and now this month's low, plotted as a light blue line on the daily chart.  * Zooming out to the weekly chart of Microsoft it becomes clear that this year's rally has pushed MSFT stock to the upper edge of a rising bullish channel, where it has started to fade. Notice the weekly chart's MACD line is now below zero, after several weeks of lower lows.  * Assuming history will repeat itself, MSFT shares are now positioned to slide back to the lower edge of that range plotted with a yellow line on the weekly chart. It now stands at $111.70, but is rising quickly. Coca-Cola (KO)Finally, Coca-Cola shares have been on a rampage since March, rallying more than 20% for the five-month stretch. More than that though, the advance has pushed KO stock out of a long-term trading range and into uncharted waters. Although overbought, shares even confirmed the strength of this breakout thrust by pulling back, finding support at a key line in the sand and then bouncing back above a long-term technical ceiling.While the momentum is undeniable, the scope of the rally thus far is unnerving. The risk of a wave of profit-taking is abnormally high. The good news is, the make-or-break line in the sand has already been identified and verified.  *   Click to EnlargeThe support level in question is the 50-day moving average line, plotted in purple on the daily chart. That line prompted the reversal that materialized two weeks ago, and is highlighted on the daily chart.  * Backing out to a weekly chart, the basis of the worry becomes clear. Just in the past few weeks, KO stock has broken above a technical ceiling that has kept shares in check since 2013. It's plotted in white.  * Although there's plenty of risk of a pullback that would bring Coca-Cola stock back to the trading range's floor near $46, marked in yellow, there has been an impressive amount of buying volume persistently through this unparalleled advance.At the time of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

(USG). But the portfolio of &quot;Buffett stocks&quot; isn't as diversified as the number might suggest. In some cases, BRK.B holds more than one share class in the same company. Some holdings are so small as to be immaterial leftovers from earlier bets the Oracle of Omaha has yet to completely exit.And perhaps most importantly, Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio is actually pretty concentrated. The top six holdings account for almost 70% of the portfolio's total value. The top 10 positions comprise 80%. Banks and airlines, to cite a couple of sectors, carry quite a load in this portfolio. Then there's the fact that several Buffett stocks actually were picked by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.Here, we examine each and every holding to give investors a better understanding of the entire Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.

In the most recent quarter which ended June 30, all three segments saw a decrease in revenues. While it still makes money on an adjusted EBITDA basis -- $205 million in Q2 2019 vs. $325 million in Q2 2018 -- the company's long-term debt of $3.2 billion is 119% of its current market cap. As for dividends, it currently yields nearly 4.8% which is very attractive. OLN has plenty of free cash flow to continue paying it out to shareholders. Currently trading at 15 times its forward earnings, Olin is a good mid-cap value play. Embotelladora Andina (AKO.B)Source: Shutterstock Embotelladora Andina (NYSE:AKO.B), otherwise known as Coca-Cola Andina, has been producing Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) products in Chile since 1946&#92;. It also has operations in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The company's American depository receipt currently yields 2.6%. Over the past five years, its payout ratio has varied from a low of 69% in 2017 to a high of 88% in 2018. Five Chilean families each own 20% of the holding company that controls Coca-Cola Andina through a 44.4% ownership stake. Coca-Cola owns 7.3% of the beverage company. In terms of market share, Coca-Cola has 63% of the Chilean soft drink market and 45% of the Chilean juice market. Within the four markets that it competes, it has a 65% market share of soft drinks, 31% of water and 42% of juices. Looking at its balance sheet, it has $850 million in net debt, which is a reasonable 29% of its market cap.   * 5 Cheap Stocks to Buy Now That the Fed Cut Rates You're not going to get capital appreciation like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) but you will do well long-term buying AKO.B stock under $20.  Tapestry (TPR)Source: Hi-Point / Shutterstock.com Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) is the parent company of both Coach and Kate Spade. It was already a beaten-down stock before it announced fourth-quarter 2019 results Aug. 15. Tapestry stock fell 22% on the news and is now down almost 42% on the year. Although its Coach brand delivered same-store sales growth of 2% in the second quarter, Kate Spade saw comparable store sales drop 6%. Since TPR acquired Kate Spade in September 2017, the brand has not generated a quarter with positive comps.It is not clear when Kate Spade's business will recover. In addition, the company said that due to Kate Spade, its profits for the year will be flat compared to last year.Like a lot of names on this list, Tapestry has to be considered a deep value play at the moment. In 2019, Tapestry still managed to generate $814 million in operating income from $6.03 billion in sales, despite a severe underperformance from Kate Spade. Equally important is the fact that Kate Spade's operating income was $187 million in 2019, just $10 million less than the previous year on a 7% decline in same-store sales.Down 42% on the year, I like its chances (unless there's a recession) of rebounding in 2020.  Whirlpool (WHR)Source: Grzegorz Czapski / Shutterstock.com The U.S.-China trade war has not been kind to Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR), which has seen its volumes fall off a cliff due to a 12% increase in washing machine prices as a result of the tariffs on Chinese imports. President Donald Trump wants Whirlpool to create U.S. jobs, but knocking $500 million off its quarterly revenue as a result of these tariffs is not the way to go about it. According to the National Interest, Whirlpool and other foreign manufacturers have created 1,800 jobs since the tariffs went into effect at a cost of $800,000 per job. Despite the sales and profit declines due to the tariffs, Whirlpool's stock is actually up almost 26% year-to-date through Aug. 19.   * 10 Cyclical Stocks to Buy (or Sell) Now A recent survey of appliance repair technicians found that Whirlpool has the most reliable washers, dryers and refrigerators as well as the second-most reliable stoves, ranges and dishwashers. Yielding 3.6% despite a big rebound in 2019, Whirlpool will pay you to wait out the tariff war.     Vail Resorts (MTN)Source: Rosemary Woller / Shutterstock.com Just fitting in under the $10-billion ceiling for mid-cap stocks, Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) is up over 13% year-to-date through Aug. 19. The operator of ski resorts in the U.S. and Canada has an exemplary performance over the past 15 years -- it's delivered an annualized total return of almost 20% to its shareholders. It seems people can't get enough skiing. And Vail can't make enough acquisitions. In July, the company announced that it would buy 100% of Peak Resorts, the owners of 17 different ski areas in the northwest U.S. including Mount Snow in Vermont and Wildcat in New Hampshire. Vail paid $264 million for the 17 hills. That's nothing compared to the $1.4 billion CAD it paid for Whistler Blackcomb in 2016. As long as interest rates remain low, you can be sure MTN will continue to gobble up ski resorts around the world, creating a tremendous amount of cash flow in the process.   Toro (TTC)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com If you're a golfer, you've likely seen Toro's (NYSE:TTC) turf maintenance machines out on the golf course. Toro is the world leader in turf maintenance products. A few years ago, it got into the winter business buying Boss Snow Plows for $227 million. Toro is one of those companies that delivers for shareholders, yet tends to fly under the radar. Up 30% year-to-date through Aug. 19 including dividends, TTC stock has a 15-year annualized total return of 16.5%, which is almost double the U.S. total market over the same period. Recently, Toro announced a new strategy for its underground construction business which would see it combine its Ditch Witch, American Augers and Trencor businesses under one operating unit. By combining the three businesses, Toro will improve its marketing, sales and service while lowering the overall cost of providing these services.   * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What The company expects to generate $3.2 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019 with earnings per share of $2.90-$3.00 or 20 times its forward earnings.  FactSet Research Systems (FDS)Source: Shutterstock Although FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) has a market cap of $10.7 billion, above the high-end for mid-cap stocks, most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds will still buy FDS because the $10-billion ceiling is more of a guideline than a hard-and-fast rule. FactSet, for those unfamiliar with the company, provides financial data and portfolio analytics to the investment community. Approximately 83% of its annual subscription revenue comes from buy-side clients including mutual funds and pensions. FactSet's having a strong year so far in 2019. It's stock is up 39% year-to-date. Over the past 15 years, it's averaged an annualized total return of 16.7%, far superior to the total market. In fiscal 2019, FactSet expects revenues of $1.43 billion with adjusted earnings of $9.85 per share. Both of these numbers are higher than its original guidance at the beginning of the fiscal year. In the latest quarter, FactSet's adjusted operating income jumped 16% to $105.7 million on a 7% increase in revenues. At 26 times its forward earnings, FDS stock isn't cheap, but in the long term, you're going to be happy you own it.  Aqua America (WTR)Source: Elena Larina / Shutterstock.com Aqua America (NYSE:WTR) is a water utility providing services to more than three million people in eight states. Despite missing both its revenue and earnings estimates for the second quarter, Aqua America's stock has kept moving higher since its Aug. 6 report. Up 31% year-to-date, WTR stock yields a reasonable 2.1% while providing attractive capital appreciation. Over the past 15 years, it's achieved an annualized total return of 10.3%.Last October, Aqua America announced that it would pay $4.3 billion to buy Peoples Natural Gas, a Pittsburgh-based natural gas distribution company providing service to more than 740,000 customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Once completed, the company will operate regulated utilities in 10 states serving more than five million people.   * 7 Stocks Under $7 to Invest in Now With a second platform for growth, investors can expect double-digit returns over the next 3-5 years.  Polaris (PII)Source: melissamn / Shutterstock.com At the end of July, Polaris (NYSE:PII) launched its 2020 lineup of side-by-side and ATV offerings, just in time for the company's 65th anniversary.  In 2019, Polaris' bottom line has been hit by Chinese tariffs. Nonetheless, it still expects to generate at least $6.10 a share in earnings in the fiscal year, despite an increase in the Section 301 tariffs from 10% to 25%. On the top line, it expects sales to grow by at least 12% with its off-road vehicles leading the charge. In addition, the company's 2018 acquisition of Boat Holdings for $807 million has already added $367 million in sales through the first six months of the year against zero sales in the previous year before it entered the boat business.  Polaris participates in a very cyclical business. While I like the company's overall portfolio of products and fully expect it to deliver for investors in the long term, you do have to have a buy-and-hold view in order to profit from PII stock. There will continue to be large peaks and valleys in its stock price. MSC Industrial Direct (MSM)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com MSC Industrial Direct (NYSE:MSM) is an industrial distributor that provides more than 1.6 million products from over 100 branches and 12 fulfillment centers to customers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the U.K. In 2018, it had $3.2 billion in revenue, 10.7% higher than a year earlier. The company reported its Q3 2019 results July 10. It missed on both the top- and bottom-line sending its stock 7% lower in the month since reporting earnings. It's down 9% year-to-date. Overall, however, the company's results for the first six months of the year aren't horrible with revenues of $2.52 billion, 6.6% higher than a year earlier, on operating income of $309.5 million, 1% lower than in the first six months of fiscal 2018.MSM stock is instituting a three-part plan to improve sales, lower costs and increase profitability. Trading at 12 times its forward earnings, a much lower multiple than its historical average, MSM stock is a nice value play at the moment.

2019-08-21,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For 47 years, the Business Roundtable has lobbied on behalf of corporate America. Much of that time, it maintained a fiction(1) -- that the sole purpose of a corporation was to maximize profits on behalf of shareholders. This philosophy has been under assault for several years now, and this week the Business Roundtable announced it wants to put it to rest.In a widely circulated memo, the 200-member organization reversed itself, writing that &quot;shareholder primacy” is no longer the sole purpose of a corporation. Instead, corporations must include a commitment to “all stakeholders,” which includes customers, employees, suppliers and local communities.Some kudos are in order for JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, and chairman of the Business Roundtable, for driving these changes. He has been discussing the need for a more inclusive form of capitalism, both in public speeches and in his letters to shareholders, for some time.But turning this aircraft carrier around won’t be easy, in large part because of the group's own history. Indeed, the Roundtable has spent most of the past four decades advocating against the interests of those exact stakeholders. To cite some of the more notable examples:&#92;-- It fought the rise of labor unions and pro-union legislation;&#92;-- Helped to defeat antitrust bills;&#92;-- Prevented the formation of the Consumer Protection Agency;&#92;-- Opposed corporate governance changes to make boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders;&#92;-- Fought proper accounting of stock options given as compensation to executives and insiders;&#92;-- Opposed increases in the national minimum wage (it now favors increases);&#92;-- Lobbied to prevent restrictions on executive compensation;&#92;-- Fought legislation that would create cleaner energy and address climate change;&#92;-- Pushed for corporate income-tax cuts;&#92;-- Supported anti-consumer Supreme Court decisions, including the fiction that corporations are legal people, and that campaign donations equal speech.   The Roundtable might respond that this is all in the past. Let’s hope so. But the organization has an even greater challenge: Scan the list of 181 signatories to the recent memo and it's a Who’s Who of corporate behavior that has burdened and disadvantaged the very stakeholders they will now champion.Consider a few of the signatories:&#92;-- Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.:  Two of the most valuable companies in the world are famously effective at using various tax dodges to avoid paying their fair share. I can recall when the Internal Revenue Service went after maneuvers that serve no valid business purpose other than tax avoidance. Consider that what isn't paid in tax by those who avoid them must be made up for by those who do -- mostly average Americans who also happen to be customers of these companies.The share of federal tax revenue paid by corporations has dropped by two-thirds in the past seven decades -- from 32% in 1952 to 10% in 2013; and corporate income tax as a share of gross domestic product has fallen from about 6% in 1946 to about 1.5% today.&#92;-- Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co.: Show good faith -- working with card-issuing banks as needed -- by simplifying the incomprehensible small print in the cardholder agreement and spell out in clear language the terms and penalties for late payment. Second, do the same for mandatory arbitration clauses that take away the right of customers to seek redress in public courts.&#92;-- Ameriprise Financial Inc., Morgan Stanley and Principal Financial Group Inc: The brokers and insurers on the list have been zealous opponents of the fiduciary rule. Instead, they prefer a less stringent rule that allows them to sell products that are better for them than for their customers. Until those firms -- and Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan are in this group -- embrace a higher duty of care, their gestures toward stakeholders are hollow. Oh, and they should drop the requirement that customers agree to mandatory arbitration clauses as one of the conditions for opening a brokerage account.&#92;-- Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc.: For years these companies have been helping the American public achieve record levels of diabetes and obesity by selling health-damaging sugary drinks. They should acknowledge and warn customers of the consequences of consuming too much of their products, and accept the same kinds of taxes and health warnings now affixed to cigarettes.&#92;-- Deere & Co.: The maker of farm machinery has led the fight against customers, insisting that they not make repairs to the equipment they own, and denying them access to parts and instructions. Repairs can only be made by Deere service technicians in what has come to be known as a “repair monopoly.” Apple, by the way, does the same thing.&#92;-- Walmart Inc. and McDonald's Corp.: Both were steadfast opponents of increases in minimum wages for years. Although both now offer higher minimum pay, it was only after a tightening labor market forced them to increase wages. But this wasn't a case of corporate altruism -- their stores were messy and employees were sullen, and pay increases were part of plans to keep ill-treated customers from defecting. (McDonald's is not a signatory to the Roundtable memo).For the Roundtable commitment to be meaningful, the signatories are going to have to alter their behavior in ways large and small, and maybe even in ways that aren't always optimal for maximizing short-term profits. Still, we should be encouraged. But the proof will be in the follow through and the actual actions of the Roundtable members.(Corrects to clarify section on credit-card companies to indicate the role of banks in setting terms for customers.   )(1) In “The Shareholder Value Myth,” Lynn Stout explained how the entire theory is based on a misreading of a 1919 court case -- Dodge vs. Ford – at the time, both privately held, non-public companies.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

This stands in sharp contrast to the market's expectations for the start of an aggressive rate cut campaign.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential With all the crosscurrents, investors would do well to focus their attention on the more defensive names in the market.

2019-08-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The 2.7 billion pound ($3.3 billion) offer for the British pub chain Greene King Plc from an investment group backed by billionaire Li Ka-Shing has put the spotlight on other unloved businesses in the U.K. leisure sector.One stands out: Whitbread Plc. Since the hotel and restaurant operator returned 2.5 billion pounds to shareholders from the 3.9 billion pound sale of its Costa coffee stores, its stock has been in the doldrums. But it owns lots of property, which is just the thing that drew Li to Greene King. Some 65% of Whitbread’s estate is freehold, and international buyers might be attracted by the prospect of using the dirt-cheap pound to grab themselves some British property assets.The central business isn’t without its attractions either. Hotels suffer more than pubs during recessions; while Brits will always eat and drink, they may be less inclined to take a mini-break. Yet Whitbread is the country’s leading hotel chain, with a focus on the value sector, so it should be able to weather a downturn. While bookings fell during the last downswing, it outperformed its rivals thanks to cost controls and winning more custom among cost-conscious holidaymakers and business travelers trading down to cheaper digs. Premier Inn, Whitbread’s main budget hotel brand, has long been seen as a potential target for a bigger chain.With the value of Whitbread’s debt and equity not much higher than the value of its real estate portfolio, there’s certainly cause for interest.Of course, the company could try to better exploit the value of that property itself. Earlier this year the Sunday Telegraph reported that the activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp., which owns a stake in Whitbread, was agitating for change on the property holdings.Greg Johnson, an analyst at Shore Capital, estimates that 3.7 billion pounds might be realized from selling the real estate, while Whitbread estimates the value of its property at between 4.9 billion pounds and 5.8 billion pounds.On Shore’s estimates, the operating company could be worth another 3.6 billion pounds. Adding in 300 million pounds for Whitbread’s German business, and assuming net debt of 500 million pounds, would take the equity value to about 7.1 billion pounds. That’s well above the current market capitalization of 5.7 billion pounds. No wonder Elliott is sharpening its knives.Superficially there’s appeal in Whitbread doing this by itself. But sale-and-leaseback deals (when companies sell off freehold sites and rent them back) are risky. Look at the retail sector, where chains such as Debenhams Plc were tied to ruinous long-term leases after following this path, hampering their financial flexibility when times got bad – as they do inevitably in consumer businesses.With the current political and economic uncertainty, Whitbread would be wise to resist any big moves to sell off its property. Activist investors were right to urge it to offload Costa to capitalize on piping hot valuations in the coffee market. Their case on real estate is less compelling.The dilemma for Whitbread’s chief executive Alison Brittain is that by leaving the freehold estate largely intact, she encourages a buyer to come in and exploit that value instead. That risk is heightened by a slump in the share price. Brittain should prepare the defenses. Shareholders should take some heart, however. She managed to wring a very good price from the Coca-Cola Company for Costa. If a property-hungry bidder came knocking for Premier Inn she might just do the same.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2019-08-23,"[Editor's note: This story was previously published in April 2018. It has since been updated and republished.]First, let's get something straight. The definition of penny stocks is entirely subjective. What I think constitutes a risky penny stock, you might feel is a robust, thriving enterprise. Therefore, before I answer the question of whether you can make money in penny stocks, I'm going to explain what I believe is the best definition of a penny stock. From there, I'll tackle the five rules investors should follow to be successful in trading penny stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe Definition: Merriam-Webster defines penny stock as &quot;a usually unlisted highly speculative stock usually selling for a dollar or less.&quot; Hence, the penny-stock moniker. Others are more liberal in their interpretation of what constitutes a penny stock.The Successful Investor, an investment newsletter publisher I do some work for here in Canada, suggests the ceiling price can go as high as $5.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy on the Dip Here's what the SEC has to say about penny stocks:&quot;The term 'penny stock' generally refers to a security issued by a very small company that trades at less than $5 per share,&quot; states the SEC website. &quot;Penny stocks generally are quoted over-the-counter, such as on the OTC Bulletin Board; penny stocks may, however, also trade on securities exchanges, including foreign securities exchanges.&quot;So, I've got reputable sources from both the U.S. and Canada who accurately define what penny stocks are, including the price at which they trade.At $5 or less, I do believe you can make money in stocks, but it helps if you follow these five simple rules.For every success story like Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), which traded below $5 as recently as 2006, there are hundreds of penny stock failures littered along the investment highway.  * The Elite 8 Stocks to Buy for Massive Outperformance Treat penny stocks just as you would any other publicly traded investment, and your chances for success increase exponentially.  Tip 1: Buy Companies With Strong Balance SheetsSource: Shutterstock Like any equity investment, it's important that you establish the financial strength of the company. When I look for stocks to invest in whether the share price is $5 or $500, I focus on companies with strong balance sheets. Although no debt is desirable when interest rates are rising, it's not very practical. This is especially true when it comes to penny stocks, many of which are still in the early stages of development. Here are two rules:1&#92;. Only invest in companies whose long-term debt (LTD) is 50% of shareholder equity or less. If a company has $1 million in debt, its shareholder equity should be at least $2 million. 2&#92;. Try to keep your penny-stock bets to those companies whose LTD is less than its market cap;  the lower, the better. Tip 2: Buy Profitable CompaniesSource: (C)iStock.com/graphicnoi As with any equity investment, it's important that you limit your investments to profitable businesses. There are two schools of thought on this. On the one hand, investing in publicly-traded companies, whether they're penny stocks or not, provides you with greater liquidity than private investments. Therefore, the ability to exit quicker justifies the higher risk many in this arena are willing to accept to generate outsize future gains. On the other hand, private investments have longer holding periods built into them -- often 3-5 years or more -- which means investors aren't nearly as concerned about profitability as they are with growth.  * 10 Marijuana Stocks That Could See 100% Gains, If Not More It really comes down to your ability to handle uncertainty. For me, I'm always looking for companies making money in the here and now. Anything less is called speculation, and while there's nothing wrong with this approach, it's not something novice investors ought to consider. Tip 3: Understand the BusinessSource: Shutterstock Like any equity investment, it's important that you understand the businesses you invest in. There's a saying that if you can't explain what a company's business does in a sentence or two, you probably shouldn't be investing.Imagine you're explaining the investment to your child who attends elementary school. It's easy to describe what Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) does: it makes soda pop. It's not nearly as simple to describe what business Bio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH) is in.At least it's not for me. Stick to what you know and understand. That's especially true with penny stocks with smaller market caps. Tip 4: Diversify Source: Simon Cunningham via FlickrLike any equity investment, it's important that you diversify your penny stocks. How many penny stocks should you own? That's the million-dollar question, no matter how big or small the investment. Some professional investors believe you've got to have a concentrated portfolio of your best ideas -- say 10 to 20 -- while others think you should spread your bets far wider over 100 stocks or more. It's a subjective answer for sure.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks With Breakout Potential What I do know is that you want to be in at least three or four sectors of the economy that generally are healthy and growing.Since the risk/reward ratio of penny stocks can be significantly higher than that of large-cap stocks such as Coca-Cola, it's far more important to diversify your investments. Tip 5: Risk What You Can Afford to LoseSource: Shutterstock Like any equity investment, it's important that you understand there are no guarantees and that you're risking the money you can afford to lose.If your child's going off to university in a couple of years and the funds you've allocated for investing will pay his or her tuition, you might want to keep your funds parked in something more stable.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-26,InvestorPlace Stock Market News Stock Advice amp Trading Tips Iconic beverage maker Coca Cola NYSE KO has been one of the surprise hits of 2019 Since this January s opening price KO stock is up almost 15 While for other investments that s hardly something to,Coca-Cola Stock Is No ‘Zero’ in a Recession
2019-08-26,"Iconic beverage maker Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has been one of the surprise hits of 2019. Since this January's opening price, KO stock is up almost 15%. While for other investments that's hardly something to write home about, the company's shares have been rangebound for many years.Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com Moreover, that frustrating sideways trading had a fundamental basis. Primarily, millennials have not gravitated toward soft drinks like prior generations. Instead, they have opted for healthier fare, which, let's face it: Coca-Cola products typically are anything but healthy. Therefore, Coca-Cola stock hasn't enjoyed much upside.However, positive sentiment has started to seep into KO stock recently. For instance, the beverage maker has repackaged its Diet Coke lineup to look taller and lither. Additionally, they've added some zesty new flavors, bringing more relevance to their &quot;healthy-ish&quot; brand.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBetter yet, KO has reported very encouraging earnings reports, despite some awfully ugly geopolitical news. In their most recent report for the second quarter, the company beat on both the top and bottom line. But what really lit a fire under Coca-Cola stock was guidance. Going completely against the grain, management raised its full-year revenue outlook, with expectations of organic revenue growth of 5% instead of the previous 4%.Certainly, stakeholders of KO stock have legitimate reasons to trust this resurgent optimism. The soft drink specialist is rolling out new products and even partnering with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for a key promotion. Plus, their Zero Sugar lineup enjoyed volume growth that measured in the double digits worldwide.Yet with the ever-escalating ugliness in the U.S.-China trade war, will the good times with Coca-Cola stock crumble? KO Stock One of Few Recession-Resistant PlaysAt first glance, avoiding Coca-Cola stock might seem like the prudent move. For one thing, shares dipped 1.4% during Friday's session. Furthermore, if we do have a panicked situation break out, virtually all stocks will suffer volatility.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects However, the key attribute that broadly protects KO stock at this juncture is its core product category. Coca-Cola is in the business of manufacturing and distributing fast-moving non-durable consumer goods. In other words, Coca-Cola brand beverages represent the last products that consumers will give up.Because if the world stops drinking Coca-Cola due to economic concerns, it means we have already entered the apocalypse.Instead, what people avoid first and foremost in a recession are durable goods, or assets that feature long usable lifespans. Thus, consumers won't make big-ticket purchases, such as homes or cars. Those types of assets usually require a significant time commitment.But soft drinks are cheap, something that almost anyone in any reasonable financial situation can afford. Moreover, they provide a distraction effect that is an especially powerful motivator during economic downturns.For instance, I recently wrote that streaming-equipment provider Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) might benefit from a recession. Historically, entertainment industries have performed well because they provide escapism for down-on-their-luck workers. And Coca-Cola is a cheap pick-me-up, a characteristic that should help KO stock during bearish markets.Most importantly, I'm not just pulling this argument out of my hind end. During the Great Recession, consumers avoided durable goods like the plague. However, non-durable consumer goods specialists like Coca-Cola weren't as heavily impacted.Also, management protected the company at the time through layoffs, and even raised prices to offset lowered volumes. I'd argue they're prepared this time too, thus providing confidence toward Coca-Cola stock. Don't Bet Too DeeplyAlthough I firmly believe that Coca-Cola stock has recession-resistant characteristics, I wouldn't go overboard with this contrarian idea.As I mentioned above, a market panic would threaten most stocks. That's because the fear of losing money is often a bigger motivator than missing out on an opportunity.But more critically, KO stock benefited from the last recession due to the China narrative. Earlier this decade, many companies eyed the Asian giant because it was enjoying robust economic growth. Put differently, they saw China as the eventual pathway that would lead the world out of recession.But in this go around, China is no longer the source of long-term optimism. Instead, it's part of the problem. And if we do have a major recession soon, what is the next China? I just don't see any other viable alternative market, which is what makes this juncture so worrisome.That said, Coca-Cola's low-cost, high-volume business and proven success with its healthy line should provide core buffers against a downturn. So, here's how I would approach shares. Let KO stock drop to its natural bearish target, which is its 50-day moving average. From there, take a small position. You want to keep the powder keg dry for any big moves down.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-27,"Equities in the tech sector usually don't become popular dividend stocks. Even when they finally introduce payouts, it often only happens after years of pressure from shareholders. These stocks also often retain the interest of shareholders more for their growth potential than the payout. Others such as Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), resist offering a dividend to this day despite having a cash hoard of over $121 billion.However, we also see indications that this attitude has shifted. Some of the largest names in tech have become every bit as mainstream as 100-plus-year-old firms such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). As they achieve this place in American business, many have begun to both begin paying dividends and building a record of consecutive annual increases.  * 10 Stocks to Own Through a Global Recession Over the next few years, many of these companies could gain the &quot;dividend aristocrat&quot; distinction as they meet the 25-year minimum threshold. Investors looking for dividend stocks in the tech sector should consider the following stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dividend Stocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL)Source: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) teetered near bankruptcy in the late 1990's. But after the return of Steve Jobs, it went on to offer many products that drive tech today as well as the first $1 trillion market cap. This success brought AAPL stock the largest cash reserve in tech. Consequently, Tim Cook placed Apple on the list of dividend stocks.The company paid its first quarterly dividend in August 2012. Today, that annual dividend comes to $3.08 per share. While the 1.45% yield may not impress many investors, it has increased the payout every year since dividends began.AAPL stock has suffered over the last year as it faced a decline in iPhone sales. However, the company has begun to compensate for this with new lines of business, such as Apple TV+ and the Apple Card. As a result, the stock has now recovered most of the losses from last year's swoon in tech stocks. Moreover, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.8 comes in lower than its peers.AAPL stock is not without risk. The trade war continues, and compensating for falling iPhone sales will not occur overnight. But with its cash hoard and dedication to innovation, AAPL should continue to serve investors well. Broadcom (AVGO)Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has become better known for its technology than for its place among dividend stocks. As a semiconductor and infrastructure software company, investors often seem to not focus on its payout.However, those who own AVGO stock for the long term, currently receive $10.60 per share in cash, a payout of around 3.7%. The company has increased this payout for nine straight years. Moreover, investors will not have to pay much for this source of cash flow. AVGO stock currently trades at less than 11.6 times forward earnings.In some respects, AVGO has become cheap for a reason. As our own Vince Martin states, succeeding with AVGO stock means placing a great deal of trust in the hands of management. The firm moved away from semiconductors when it bought software company CA Technologies. If rumors prove true, Broadcom could target Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) next. This would broaden its involvement on the software side.  * 7 5G Stocks to Connect Your Portfolio To One the one hand, the pivot into software seems strange at a time when many companies want to focus on fewer business lines. Still, with profit growth set to return to double-digits next year, the dividend for AVGO stock looks set to keep growing.  Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Former Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) CEO John Chambers resisted payouts for years, often stating that &quot;acquisitions and investments make better use of cash.&quot;However, by 2010, cash reserves had continued to grow. At that time, it had held more cash than any other tech company. With the need to recover price growth in the equity following the financial crisis, CSCO stock joined the list of tech dividend stocks in 2011. Today, shareholders receive $1.40 per share. This takes the cash return to about 2.9% at today's stock price.This payout has risen every year since the company began paying dividends. Due to the company's reinvention, it should have no trouble maintaining these increases. CSCO began as the hardware networking company that helped build the internet. Today it has ventured into cloud computing and cybersecurity. They also announced a $5-billion investment into 5G over the next three years.Today, many companies hold more enormous cash reserves than Cisco. Also, its predicted profit growth of 7.7% will probably not excite many investors. However, they can now buy this income stream for around 13.1 times forward earnings. Once 5G takes off, CSCO stock could see its best years since the heyday of the 1990s tech boom. With a dividend now attached, that growth becomes all the more enticing to investors. Intel Corporation (INTC)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com In the 1990s, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) broke from its big-tech peers and introduced a dividend. However, when the company first began its payout in 1997, it did not leave much of an impression on Wall Street. At an annual rate of just 3 cents per share, investors continued to treat INTC stock like a growth equity.In this area, Intel has awarded patience. Today, the INTC stock dividend now stands at $1.26 per share, a yield of about 2.7%. Moreover, this yield has risen for four consecutive years. Trading at just 10.2 times forward earnings, this could entice a lot of investors.In many respects, INTC stock has become cheap for a reason. The decline of the PC and turmoil in the C-suite led to several missteps with the company. It fell behind as long-time peers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) took technical leads over the chip giant. It has also suffered as it exits the smartphone modem business and deals with an industry-wide chip glut.  * 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks to Buy to Pay the Bills However, rumors indicate Intel may not have fallen as far behind AMD as many had feared. Moreover, the rise of 5G could change Intel's fortunes. So-called &quot;network cloudification&quot; could again bring Intel to the forefront. If nothing else, this should further payout increases and could make INTC one of the more profitable tech dividend stocks to own. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Source: gguy / Shutterstock.com Like many of its peers during the 1990s tech bubble, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates resisted dividends. However, by 2003, Steve Ballmer had taken over as CEO. Moreover, Gates was looking to funnel more cash to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Both events helped to incentivize a dividend, and MSFT stock made its first payout in 2003. That followed with a special dividend of $3.08 per share in 2004.Although the company has not paid another such special dividend, it has increased its payout every year since that time. Today, MSFT pays $1.84 per share annually.The 1.3% return shareholders earn may not excite investors. However, the overall company is at the top of its game under current CEO Satya Nadella. Today, many think of Microsoft more as a cloud leader than a PC-operating system company.As a result, profits and stock prices keep surging higher. The forward P/E ratio stands at 22.7, and it has again claimed its &quot;world's largest company&quot; moniker with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. With $133.82 billion in cash and a AAA credit rating, investors will struggle to find a more secure dividend than that of MSFT stock. NetApp (NTAP)Source: tanpanamanoob / Shutterstock.com NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) performs cloud data services and data management. It begun as a storage hardware company called Network Appliance in 1992 and followed both the boom and bust cycles of the 1990s tech bubble. However, the stock has moved steadily higher since after the tech bust. Although it still focuses on storage, it has pivoted more toward the cloud in recent years.It joined the ranks of tech dividend stocks in 2013, and that payout has increased every year since. Today, the dividend comes to $1.92 per share and delivers just over 3.3% in cash returns. Moreover, while I do not see another 1990s-like boom for NTAP stock, it could soon become a buying opportunity.NTAP stock lost nearly half of its value over the last year as tech stocks took a hit amid the U.S.-China trade war. However, that massive decline could turn around soon. Analysts predict that a temporary decrease in profits this year will give way to 11.3% earnings growth next year. Furthermore, it trades at a forward P/E ratio of just 10.2.  * 7 High-Yielding Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade Investors may want to wait until the NTAP stock price stops falling before buying. However, with a low P/E ratio and a stable dividend that can maintain its growth amid an industry slowdown, investors will likely place NTAP on their stocks to buy list soon. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com In recent years, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has garnered more attention for court battles and mergers than for smartphone chips. The rise of 5G could help to turn QCOM stock around. However, traders often forget that amid the turmoil with lawsuits, Qualcomm has quietly made itself one of the more compelling dividend stocks in tech.Its annual payout of $2.48 per share gives investors a cash return of almost 3.5%. It has also increased this dividend for eight consecutive years. The payout kept rising even as QCOM stock suffered from lawsuits and threats by companies to go elsewhere.Qualcomm still faces court battles, but it recently won a reprieve against the FTC's antitrust probe of the company. Moreover, QCOM profits should move higher as consumers will soon upgrade their phones to 5G.Given these conditions, one can easily understand why analysts predict a 21.3% increase in profits next year. Similar increases should follow in subsequent years. Despite this likely rise in earnings, investors can buy QCOM for just 17.6 times forward earnings.QCOM has suffered in recent years amid lawsuits and antitrust challenges. But with 5G coming soon, QCOM should deliver not only on price growth but also as a high-paying dividend stock.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-28,"Wednesday was an interesting day of market action. Stocks rallied even as some market observers said investors may be overlooking mounting signs of a looming recession.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com On a related note, new Quinnipiac Poll showed 37% of those surveyed believe the U.S. economy is declining while just 31% see it getting better. Should those numbers worsen in the coming months, it's likely a death knell for President Donald Trump's 2020 reelection bid because the economy has long been the issue he has polled favorably on.Adding to those concerns was a separate poll of would-be homebuyers that indicates more than a third are expecting a recession to arrive in 2020. Reading the tea leaves here, it would be reasonable to assume that, like him or not, President Trump is shrewd enough to realize that the trade war with China is seen as crimping the economy. He cannot carry that baggage into 2020 and hope to be reelected.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Tech Industry Dividend Stocks for Growth and Income Even with those ominous headlines, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.38% while the S&P 500 added 0.65%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1%. Victorious VisaI mention Visa (NYSE:V) today not because the stock finished higher (it didn't) and not because it is one of the Dow's best-performing names this year (it is), but rather because the often-overlooked Dow component was on the receiving end of some bullish analyst commentary today, indicating it could add to its 35.2% year-to-date gain.&quot;We've come away from the meeting with greater conviction that V's 'network of networks' strategy is significantly expanding the company's opportunity set--and as a consequence, we see V continuing to generate strong volume growth,&quot; said Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell in a recent note.The analyst has a $199 price target on Visa shares. Oil Bucks Bad NewsExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), the Dow's two energy components, traded higher today, which was something of a surprise when considering some gloomy commentary about oil prices out from Morgan Stanley this morning.&quot;More cuts would be required in 2020 if [OPEC] were to balance the market,&quot; said Morgan Stanley analysts. &quot;Much depends on demand growth next year, but on our current estimates the 'call on OPEC' is about 1M bbl/day below current production in 2020.&quot;Rather, Chevron and Exxon were propped up by a bullish inventories report, showing a larger-than-expected decline. Last week, domestic oil inventories declined by 10 million barrels, more than double the expected 4.7 million-barrel drop, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Nike Sizing Up New HighsNike (NYSE:NKE) is a stock I've mentioned plenty in this space because of its tariff sensitivity, which explains a dismal August performance for the stock, but the shares surged 1.78% today. The stock resides just 7% below its 52-week high, though, and some traders are talking about a swift return to record highs for the athletic apparel maker. So if you're looking for a large-cap growth name for your portfolio, Nike is viable name to consider over the near-term. A Defensive DynamoIt's hard to ignore the stocks that have been trading high in a rough August for the broader market. One of those names is Dow component Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Sure, the stock is up &quot;just&quot; 1.35% this month, but that's pretty good for a slow-moving consumer staples name, and really good when considering broader benchmarks have been thrashed.The stock is healthy, fundamentally and technically speaking, prompting some traders to call more new highs over the near-term. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayIt's hard to reconcile all the gloomy chatter about the economy with today's equity market upside, but the path of least resistance for this school of thought is that if more signs of weakness emerge for the U.S. economy, President Trump will &quot;cool it&quot; on the trade front and the Federal Reserve will react swiftly with more rate cuts.For the rest of this week, I wouldn't bank on much action, save for President Trump getting active on Twitter, because the Labor Day holiday is looming. We could see some modest selling Thursday and Friday as traders look to dial back risk ahead of the long weekend.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-08-29,"Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock has been it with investors of late. The question is, can the bullish behavior in KO stock last? Let's take a look at what's happening off and on the price chart to draw a more informed decision and look at a better way to manage position exposure.Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com Wall Street has been very sweet on Coca-Cola the past couple months. And it's not as though the iconic brand and one of the market's more legendary investments wasn't already doing well. It was. But shares have seen an almost caffeine-like boost of about 13% since the end of May. That's certainly a nice return in any market. But to add some perspective, over the same period the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up approximately 5%. While that gain is decent, it's less than half of KO's. Further, the market barometer has also shed 5% from last month's all-time-highs. So, what gives?For starters, everyone likes a good defensive play during more turbulent times. And with today's inverted yield curve and the U.S.-China trade war continuing to threaten the global economy -investing in a more defensive business like KO stock, which also pays a dividend of nearly 3%, invariably becomes more attractive to investors. But there's more to today's Coke too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsGrowth is back for KO stock. The last couple of quarters have shown strong international sales growth from Coke's water and juice products. The most recent earnings report in early July also marked the seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth from its signature Coca-Cola Zero Sugar soda beverage. That's still not everything KO is offering today's investors.  * 7 Stocks to Buy Down 10% in the Past Week Nearly 25% of Coca-Cola's total sales are the result of new products or reformulated beverages. That's up nearly 70% from revenues of just 15% two years ago. Lastly, with Coke's solid quarterly results paired with upwardly revised sales guidance of 5% organic growth, KO stock remains it, but even more so and for good reason. KO Stock's Monthly Price ChartKO stock has been in as clean of an orderly uptrend as you'll find in the market when looking at the monthly chart over the past decade. Now that bullish determination has seen a more aggressive buyer enter the picture.Over the past three months shares have managed to successfully break above KO stock's long-standing channel resistance line. When will this cycle of more bubbly enthusiasm end? It's impossible to answer that question. But with market conditions at its back and reasonably, a stronger cycle of growth for Coca-Cola, I wouldn't bet against KO. In fact, I'd suggest buying shares today.The bottom line is that with Coca-Cola trading just narrowly above its July high and confirming five straight months of higher highs and higher lows, KO stock remains a friendly trend worth investing in. Still, to ensure your Coke purchase remains fresh-looking without fearing a technical reprisal, I'd recommend a blended 5% stop loss for exiting in order to keep a lid on losses and the powder dry for future opportunities.Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-08-29,"When volatility and uncertainty creep into the market, some investors start frantically looking around for new investments. They bounce back and forth between the latest fad investments and end up churning their portfolios.We're different. We prefer to stick with the old classics that have been performing well because those are the same stocks that are likely to continue performing well. Why? Because they are the fundamentally sound investments that tend to do well during all market conditions.That's why we're going back to one of our favorite stocks today with a new trade on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). There's no need to mess around with a &quot;New Coke.&quot; We like the profitable taste of the &quot;classic&quot; version just fine.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Bucking the Bearish Trend  Confusion about the trade situation is dragging on stocks, as we mentioned in our last recommendation.Periods of market volatility are frustrating, and they can seem like they last a very long time. However, statistically speaking, downturns are shorter than bull trends, and we don't see enough fundamental weakness to justify a negative outlook in September and October.But there is some good news out there. The Conference Board released its measure of consumer attitudes towards the U.S. economy this week, and the indicator was at a new 19-year high. We're expecting the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)'s Personal Income and Outlays report to help confirm the strength of the American consumer.One product consumers can't get enough of is Coca-Cola, and KO's performance proves it.KO has been bucking the bearish trend on Wall Street all month. While the S&P 500 has fallen and consolidated at lower levels during August, KO has been pushing higher. The stock even hit a new 52-week high this week. New Support at $53Seeing this bullish momentum gives us a lot of confidence the stock is going to remain well above the support level at $53, which it established in late July and early August.If you look at the chart below, you can see KO is still above the $53 level now.Daily Chart of Coca-Cola Company (KO) -- Chart Source: TradingViewThe stock first jumped up above $53 after the company reported its quarterly earnings on July 23. KO beat revenue expectations by $138.61 million and earnings expectations by $0.02 per share last quarter, and we anticipate the company's growth is continuing this quarter as consumer spending in the United States remains high. KO itself is expecting total sales growth of 12-13%.All of this makes a put write an ideal strategy for this situation, and support at $53 gives us a good strike price to use.To find out which KO covered calls we're selling--and to get access to our full portfolio of income-generating trades--sign up for a risk-free trial of Strategic Trader today.InvestorPlace advisers John Jagerson and S.

2019-08-30,"[Editor's note: &quot;5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider&quot; was previously published in July 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]I attended a meeting of startup founders who pitched their companies. Interestingly enough, many of them touted their use of artificial intelligence.This technology has quickly become red hot. After all, the market opportunity is massive. Gartner estimates that spending on AI will grow at an average compound annual growth rate of 18% to $383.5 billion by 2020.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsYet AI is not easy to develop. Huge amounts of data must be accessed to find patterns. Moreover, top-notch data scientists must be hired to work on AI. As should be no surprise, this kind of talent is in short supply nowadays.Because of all this,  only larger companies usually focus on AI.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off Let's take a look at five AI-intensive companies that stand out: Alphabet (GOOG)Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, refers to the company as &quot;AI first.&quot; And this is certainly not hype.Source: Shutterstock AI has become pervasive across the product line, such as with Gmail, YouTube, Maps, Photos, Google Cloud and so on. The company has also developed its own assistant, which connects with more than 5,000 devices in the home.Google has been creating industry standards for AI as well, primarily through its own language called TensorFlow. Just some of the companies that use it include Uber, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).Also, Google is a top player in autonomous vehicles. The company's Waymo unit could be worth as much as $175 billion, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.Finally, the valuation of GOOG stock is at reasonable levels, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio at 28.62, which is in-line with other mega tech operators like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). That puts it at the top of the heap among artificial intelligence stocks. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the pioneer of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which are chips that process large amounts of data cost-effectively. The technology was initially focused on the gaming market.Source: Shutterstock But NVDA realized that GPUs were also ideal for AI. To this end, the company has sold them to companies for use in datacenters and autonomous vehicles.No doubt, it has been a very good move. Consider that NVDA had been on a strong growth ramp before flattening a bit at the end of its  last fiscal year.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off It's true that the valuation of NVDA stock is far from cheap, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio at 23.6x. But then again, a premium is to be expected for a company that is a leader in a massive industry.For example, earlier this year Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse boosted the price target on NVDA stock to $400, which implied 41% upside and now implies a gain of more than 100%. In his report, he noted that the company's technology is &quot;becoming the standard AI platform.&quot; IBM (IBM)AI is nothing new for IBM (NYSE:IBM). The company has been developing this type of technology for many years. For example, back in 1985, it developed its AI computer called Deep Blue.Source: Atomic Taco via FlickrDeep Blue  actually beat chess world champion Garry Kasparov in 1996. Then in 2011, IBM created Watson to take on the best players on the quiz show Jeopardy!. The computer won.IBM has definitely had its troubles. But the investments in AI and other cutting-edge technologies have been making a difference. Note that during the over a recent 12 months period , IBM's Strategic Imperatives, which include cloud computing, security, analytics, Big Data and mobile, generated $40 billion, more than 50% of  itstotal revenues. This has helped improve the growth rate of the overall business.IBM stock also has an attractive dividend yield, which is at 4.9%. This is one of the highest in the tech industry. And its valuation is reasonable as well. Consider that the forward P/E ratio is only 1ten. Yext (YEXT)Yext (NYSE:YEXT) has been among the most exciting Artificial Intelligence stocks.Source: TechCrunch via FlickrThat's because the company is a top data provider, with integrations of over 150 services from operators like Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY).Yext has also added context and intent to all this, which allows for more accurate real-time searches.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off On the latest earnings call, CEO Howard Lerman noted:&quot;Today, we manage more than 185 million facts about our customers in our platform, providing brand-verified answers in services like Google, Siri, Alexa and WeChat to consumers looking for information verified by the source of truth.&quot;Its growth has been strong, as the company has been getting a great deal of traction with enterprise customers. Baidu (BIDU)When it comes to the search business, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) remains the king in China.Source: Simone.Brunozzi Via FlickrBIDU has invested heavily in becoming a serious AI company. This has helped it personalize the search experience and improve the impact of online ads.But AI has done more than just bolster BIDU's own platform. The company has created several platforms for third parties. One is DuerOS, which has an installed base of 100 million devices and processes over 400 million queries a month. Then there is Apollo. It is an AI system for autonomous vehicles. Recently, BIDU partnered with King Long Motors to launch the first fully self-driving L4 minibus.The AI efforts have been paying off, and BIDU's  business model will enable it to grow easily.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

2019-09-04,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. borrowed $7 billion in its first bond sale in nearly two years, as cheap funding costs tempt even companies flush with cash.The tech giant joined a slew of companies that rushed to borrow in investment-grade debt markets after the Labor Day holiday, taking advantage of yields near all-time lows. Tuesday saw a record 21 bond sales totaling almost $27 billion, led by Walt Disney Co. More than a dozen companies priced deals Wednesday.Apple, which has more than $200 billion in cash and securities on its books, sold senior unsecured bonds in five parts. The longest portion of the offering, a $1.5 billion 30-year security, will yield 1.03 percentage points above Treasuries, after an initially discussed spread of about 1.25 percentage points, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Read more: Why Apple’s Borrowing $7 Billion Even With 30 Times That in CashApple, along with peers Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp., has not tapped the bond market since new U.S. tax laws took effect at the beginning of last year, allowing companies to repatriate overseas earnings at a lower cost. It’s been using that source of cash to fund capital returns in the meantime, an activity it had typically relied on investors for. The company last sold bonds in November 2017, in a $7 billion debt offering.With a rally in Treasuries pushing the average investment-grade bond yield to just 2.79%, companies are getting in while the getting is good. Disney hadn’t issued bonds in nearly a year until Tuesday, and Coca-Cola Co. is borrowed in dollars Wednesday for the first time since May 2017. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. also returned to the market after a yearlong absence.Apple has been aiming for a net-cash-neutral position, but its cash still exceeds debt by around $100 billion. In April, it increased its share repurchase program to $175 billion from $100 billion, of which $78.2 billion had been used by the end of June. Proceeds from the bond sale could be used to buy back shares, as well as for acquisitions and debt repayment, among other uses.Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managed Apple’s bond sale.To contact the reporter on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Dan Wilchins, Christopher DeRezaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Apple Sells $7 Billion of Debt in First Bond Sale Since 2017

2019-09-04,"Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) is coming off a brutal August, the latest in a long line of rough months for the Canadian cannabis company. With each month of struggles, the shares become a little more tempting.Source: Shutterstock With an annual cannabis output that now exceeds 625,000 kilograms, it's easy to see why some investors may find Aurora stock attractive. The company offers scale in an often fragmented market. It's one of the world's largest cannabis producers and some of its core competencies include industry-leading output and logistical capabilities.Last month, the company released preliminary fiscal fourth-quarter results, including a forecast of sales of $100 million CAD to $107 million CAD. That's good for a roughly five-fold increase from the year-earlier period and 60% quarter-over-quarter growth. Those headlines temporarily bought ACB stock some goodwill among investors. However, as Aurora stock has often shown, making the good times last is easier said than done.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company's official quarterly earnings report is due out Sept. 15 and that should be a catalyst, in one way or another, for Aurora Cannabis stock. Management also upped its production outlook to 25,000 kilograms to 30,000 kilograms, above a previous forecast calling for 25,000 kilograms at the high end.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer noted that these preliminary results imply stronger-than-expected yields, which could help the company approach a cost per gram of less than $1 CAD, or 75 U.S. cents. Sourcing Growth for Aurora CannabisIntegral to the long-term thesis for Aurora stock is management's ability to find growth channels outside of Canada and the medicinal marijuana market. Those are viable growth opportunities, but they are largely baked into Aurora stock. By some forecasts, medicinal marijuana will see some contraction in the coming years.Morningstar's Kristoffer Inton said that he believes the medical market will shrink as recreational use is legalized. He also forecasts 20% average annual growth for the next decade, thanks to &quot;black-market&quot; consumers moving towards legal use.  * 7 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now That's a perfect segue into talking about the U.S. Cannabis companies and investors are betting that increased U.S. legalization will bring recreational use out of the shadows. While some states have signed off on it, cannabis for medical and recreational purposes is illegal at the federal level in the U.S.Aurora Cannabis is eyeing the U.S. market in its own way, and acknowledges that a footprint south of it home market &quot;is nonnegotiable.&quot; There are plenty of other reasons why ACB stock could get a jolt. The company just needs U.S. policymakers' attitude toward cannabis to loosen up.&quot;Not only is the U.S. a larger opportunity, but it has a better economic model,&quot; GMP Securities analyst Rob Fagan told Barron's. &quot;In most states, you're allowed to go direct to your customer -- from production right up to retail -- cashing in on more of the value chain. There are also fewer restrictions on product forms and advertising than in Canada.&quot; Finding a Partner for ACB StockUnlike some of its rivals, Aurora Cannabis is currently without partners from the tobacco or beverage industries, although the company has admitted Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) would make for an appealing partner.This goes back to Aurora's relationship with activist investor Nelson Peltz. Peltz has famously (and successfully) pushed for change at companies such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN). However, the relationship with Peltz is something that is also baked into Aurora Cannabis stock. Investors are now demanding something substantive to come of his involvement.Inton said that Aurora Cannabis is limited in its potential to benefit from new partnerships. This is because of its lack of exposure in the U.S. market.For ACB stock, the writing is on the wall. The company must make a credible foray into the U.S. and execute on that endeavor, or risk generating dissatisfaction.The U.S. market remains an &quot;X factor&quot; for Canadian cannabis companies. But, the good news is that Aurora Cannabis stock is well below a credible fair value estimate of $9-$10.Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"It feels like markets have been inching toward this point for some time. The point I'm referring to is some constructive commentary regarding trade between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.Source: aapsky / Shutterstock.com News hit the wires last night that representatives of the two  nations will meet in Washington, D.C. next month to discuss trade issues. The news sent markets soaring today. Importantly, the S&P 500 broke past some stiff resistance today, encouraging some technical analysts to opine that this rally might have some legs to it. That would be extraordinary, considering September's dubious reputation.Adding to stocks' gains today was a bullish private payroll survey from ADP, which showed the addition of 195,000 private sector jobs in August, easily topping the 148,000 new jobs economists, on average, had expected. The Department of Labor reveals its August jobs number tomorrow before the bell, with economists on average expecting the addition of 160,000 new jobs, with unemployment holding steady at 3.7% and wages growing 3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Today, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.75% while the S&P 500 climbed 1.31% to put the technically significant 3,100 level back in play. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.41%. In late trading, 27 of the Dow's 30 components were higher. Winners GaloreStoked by the trade news, tariff-sensitive Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) was one of the Dow's best-performing names today, gaining more than 3%.Shares of Caterpillar &quot;headed for the biggest gain since April as trade tensions eased, improving the sales outlook for the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment,&quot; according to Bloomberg.Caterpillar's Thursday move wasn't surprising, but it was a pleasant surprise to see International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) keeping pace with Caterpillar for top honors in the Dow today.IBM, a good way for conservative investors to get some tech exposure, is on a torrid pace of late, up nearly 4% this week. With today's surge, the stock reclaimed its 50-day moving average. IBM stock could reach $150 to $155 in the near-term.Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) jumped more than 1% following some bullish analyst chatter. Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr likes United Technologies stock and recommends buying the name right here, right now.&quot;Investors seem fixated on the [Raytheon] merger but under-appreciate major cyclical turns at Otis [and] Pratt, [United Tech's] recession resistance, and likely [second-half earnings] beats,&quot; von Rumohr said in a Wednesday research report. &quot;With [the] separation [and] merger on track, transactional overhang should abate, offering upside to our $150 [price target].&quot;Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), a name I highlighted yesterday, also gained more than 1% today on news that the largest U.S. oil company is selling its Norwegian oil and gas assets for $4 billion. The move should help the company bolster its cash flow. Exxon's cash position is one reason some analysts remain enthusiastic about the stock. Odds And EndsWith investors flocking to riskier assets today, bond yields soared (finally), helping each of the Dow's financial services components trade noticeably higher on the day. That included Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).Underscoring banks' sensitivity to low interest rates, shares of Goldman jumped more than 2% despite noted bank analyst Dick Bove of Odeon Capital cutting his rating on the investment bank to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;buy.&quot; The analyst noted that GS' trimming some high level executives &quot;suggests an unhealthy level of turmoil.&quot;The Dow offenders today were defensive names Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). All fell by modest percentages. Bottom LineInvestors got significant help today on the trade front. Tomorrow is a new today and one that brings comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. If the jobs number is strong and the trade talks appear viable, investors hoping for more rate cuts may want to pin those hopes on 25, not 50, basis points. As it is, some market observers believe global central banks are close to running out of tools.&quot;The U.S. is not quite there yet, but we will see as soon as next month how much closer the ECB gets to monetary debasement (we think they're still some ways away, as they haven't fully exhausted their negative interest rate path, it seems),&quot; said BlackRock. &quot;Ironically, the beggar-thy-neighbor implications of competitive devaluations will almost certainly incite a response from countries who may not originally even have needed to resort to currency debasement in the first place, raising the potential for full blown currency war.&quot;As of this writing, Todd Shriber does not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"As investors get more nervous about the U.S. trade war with China, defensive plays such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) have become more popular. Up 27% (including dividends) over the past year through August 30, KO stock continues to generate significant attention from investors.Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com Before you buy Coca-Cola stock and throw it in a drawer, you might also want to consider investing in the entire Coca-Cola portfolio. Here's why. The Sum of the PartsCoca-Cola's equity method investments generated $75.5 billion in revenue in 2018, along with $7.5 billion in operating income. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCoca-Cola's major equity method investments include 19% of Coca-Cola European Partners (NYSE:CCEP), 19% of Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), 20% of AC Bebidas, Arca Continental's (OTCMKTS:EMBVF) beverage business, 28% of Coca-Cola Femsa (NYSE:KOF), 23% of Coca-Cola HBC (OTCMKTS:CCHGY), and 18% of Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan (OTCMKTS:CCOJY).    Coca-Cola currently trades at 7.1 times sales. Assuming its equity method investments were one entity and also sold at 7.1 times sales, they would have a market cap of $536 billion, or more than double Coca-Cola's entire valuation. Not mentioned in the six equity method investments from above is Coca-Cola Consolidated (NASDAQ:COKE), the largest Coca-Cola bottler in the U.S. Coca-Cola owns 35% of its stock. Here's the market cap valuation of all seven equity method investments (Source: Morningstar and Wall Street Journal):Company Market Cap Coca-Cola's Interest Coca-Cola European Partners $26.0B $5.0B Monster Beverage $31.6B $6.1B AC Bebidas  N/A N/A Coca-Cola Femsa $12.3B $3.4B Coca-Cola HBC $11.0B $2.5B Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan $3.9B $702.0M Coca-Cola Consolidated $3.2B $1.1B The only holding that I wasn't able to come up with an approximate valuation is AC Bebidas. That's because it's an 80% -owned subsidiary of Arca Continental, which has other interests in addition to its beverage business.   * 7 Deeply Discounted Energy Stocks to Buy That said, the company's beverage business accounted for 89% of its 2018 revenue. So, let's assume its valuation is 89% of its $9.2 billion market cap, which means Coke's 20% interest is worth approximately $1.6 billion. In total, the seven equity method investments are worth approximately $20.4 billion, $1 billion higher than the carrying value of $19.4 billion, which doesn't include minority investments in BodyArmor and its other growth ventures. KO Stock Performance vs. Equity InvestmentsAs I said in the beginning, Coca-Cola stock has generated a total return of 27% over the past year, 193 basis points better than the U.S. total market. How have the other stocks performed?(Source: Morningstar 1-Year returns)Company 1-Year Total Return Coca-Cola European Partners 34.5% Monster Beverage -3.7% AC Bebidas  -17.4%* Coca-Cola Femsa 0.6% Coca-Cola HBC 5.5% Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan -26.9% Coca-Cola Consolidated 99.1% You'll notice an asterisk beside AC Bebidas's total return. That's because I used its parent, Arca Continental's one-year return, and that's based on its performance on the Pink Sheets. Its performance on the Mexico Bolsa was -17.6%, so it's reasonably accurate. The performance of the seven stocks was either good -- COKE up 99.1% -- or bad -- CCOJY was down 26.9%. Overall, based on a $1,000 investment for all seven stocks, they generated a total return of 13.1%, about half Coca-Cola's total return over the past year. The Bottom Line on KO StockWhile some of the seven Coca-Cola equity investments have done poorly over the past year -- Monster would be at the top of the list of disappointments -- I wouldn't bet against some of them rebounding over the next 6-12 months.   * 10 Stocks to Buy for September That being said, it's a heck of a lot easier to make a single investment in KO stock, stick it in a drawer, and enjoy a steady stream of dividends and capital appreciation over the next 3-5 years or longer.  At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-05,"Market volatility, tariff tensions with China, the inverted bond yield curve – all are coming together now and prompting recession fears. The factors are linked. The trade war with China is escalating (new tariffs on $112 billion worth of Chinese goods went into effect on September 1), increasing the chances of a more direct impact on the American consumer’s wallet and adding to recession-related worries. Nervous investors are more likely to buy and sell, adding to volatility. The lack of short-term confidence pushes up the cost of the 2-year bond, driving it above the 10-year bond. The inverted yield curve is widely seen as an early predictor of recession, occurring as much as two years before an actual downturn.So, it’s fair to say that the sky, for investors, is growing cloudy. There may be trouble on the horizon, but of what sort, it’s hard to say. It does, however, make the present the best time to buy into the classic defensive stocks. These are companies that focus on staples, in food and drink, or home health products, or low-cost family entertainment, that bring in steady return no matter the economic conditions. They offer investors strong fundamentals and reliable dividends.We’ll look at four here, all blue-chip investments, including one of Warren Buffett’s favorites, based on the TipRanks Stock Screener. Coca-Cola Company (KO)Warren Buffett loves Coke. He doesn’t hide it; he’s sat in front of Congress with a Coke in hand. And along with his love of the cola, he loves the stock. The Coca-Cola Company meets some of Buffett’s chief criteria for a long-term investment: It has an excellent reputation and one of the world’s best-known brands supporting a business that can practically run itself. As Buffett is reported to have told Bill Gates, “A ham sandwich could run Coca-Cola.”The reputation and branding are the keys. In a less facetious moment, Buffett also once said, “If you gave me $100 billion and said take away the soft drink leadership of Coca-Cola in the world, I'd give it back to you and say it can't be done.” Buffett’s confidence is built on Coke’s moat, a term Buffett uses for the protection the company gains from its long-term ability to protect its business niche and market share. In addition, Buffett appreciates Coke’s dividend. While modest, at 2.89%, it provides a steady $1.60 per share annually.Buffett is not the only fan of Coca-Cola stock. Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian recently met with the company’s CFO and came away convinced that KO is poised for further growth. He noted three reasons why Coke’s future is bright: “Improved execution and relationships with bottler partners worldwide; a focus on smaller and higher priced goods; and new product innovation, which accounts for 25% of total revenue versus 15% just two years ago.” Mohsenian gives KO shares a price target of $60, suggesting an upside potential of 8%.Overall, KO shares hold a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 6 buy and 5 hold ratings set in the last three months. Shares are selling for $55 in today’s trading, and the average price target of $57 gives the stock a potential upside of 3%. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Like Coke, Johnson & Johnson has an easily recognizable brand. From its ‘no more tears’ baby shampoo to Band Aids, Tylenol, and Listerine, the company’s products are widely used and perennially popular. Along with the company’s pharmaceutical line, which includes drugs to treat autoimmune conditions, cancer, hepatitis, and depression, these products give JNJ the same type of moat that defends Coca-Cola. The company shares its success through a 2.95% dividend, with a $3.80 annualized payout.Even strong defensive stocks can feel pressure, however, and JNJ has had some bed news recently. The company was named as a defendant in a Federal lawsuit brought by the State of Oklahoma, seeking damages for the epidemic of opioid addiction in the US. In a decision last month, a Federal judge JNJ liable for up to $572 million.While hardly good news, the lawsuit and verdict did not deter 5-star analyst Joanne Wuensch, of BMO Capital, from setting a buy rating on the stock. She noted the company is not required to pay anything until after the appeals process, which can easily last until 2021, and that JNJ has the cash on hand to simply pay the judgement now if it chooses. In her note, she says, “Notwithstanding the $15.2 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities on the second-quarter balance sheet and its AAA credit rating, J&J is not into the habit of accruing legal payments until they are probable and reasonably estimated. We remind investors that litigation is long, lengthy, and difficult to read, and while the amount is less than it could have been, we would expect an extended resolution.” She put a $157 price target JNJ shares, implying an upside of 21%.Her optimism is shared by Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford. While declining to set a specific price target on the stock, Bedford agrees with Wuensch about the likely long-term path of the litigation. He says, “After speaking with management, we remain optimistic in the defense case for J&J when heading to the appellate courts and ultimately believe the $572M will likely be reduced.” In line with his optimism, he gives JNJ shares a firm buy rating.The analyst consensus on Johnson & Johnson is another Moderate Buy, based on an even split of 4 buys and 4 holds. In a sign of the stock’s underlying strength, the $151 average price target suggests an upside of 17% from the share price of $128. Procter & Gamble Company (PG)Since the spring of 2018, Procter & Gamble has been showing steady share price growth, regardless of the broader market conditions. In an obvious indicator of the stock’s steady growth, PG is up 32% year-to-date.Procter & Gamble has built its success on a diverse line-up of home-health and cleaning products, including Tide laundry detergent, Ivory soap, Pampers, Crest toothpaste, and Charmin toilet paper. For the most part, these are true staple products, needed in every household, and they underlie PG’s $67 billion-plus per year in revenue. The company shares those revenues with investors, through a dividend. Like the other stocks in this list, PG’s dividend offers a modest yield, at 2.46%, but offsets that with a $2.98 annualized payout and a reliable payment history.Morgan Stanley’s Dara Mohsenian, quoted above on Coca-Cola, is also bullish on PG. He gives the stock a $129 price target, and said that the company’s recently completed fiscal year gave “…greater confidence in our thesis that the company's market share gains and strong category pricing can continue to drive above-consensus topline growth. Coupled with P&G's outsized gross margin expansion, we expect higher EPS growth than peers.” Mohsenian’s price target suggests 5% upside to the stock.PG’s recent gains have pushed the stock right up to its $122 average target. The share price is now $121, leaving room for just a 1% upside. This is reflected in the Moderate Buy analyst consensus, based on 4 buys and 5 holds from the past three months. Walt Disney Company (DIS)The House of Mouse is a perennial strong performer, based on the solid foundation of the famed Disney Vault, a near-century’s worth of animated and live action family films, and the universal brand of Mickey Mouse. Disney has defended both its reputation and its profitability over the years, partly by producing consistently high-quality films, partly by making smart acquisitions, and partly by adapting to changes in the movie industry. The company now owns the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, along with a cruise line, consumer products like Disney Princesses, and ESPN.This array of entertainment business is enormously lucrative, and in its last fiscal year Disney recorded almost $60 billion in revenues and over $12 billion in net income. Shareholders benefit directly from the 1.29% dividend yield, which gives them a payout of $1.76 per share annually. The company is using its income and cash flow to continue its history of adaptation to changing conditions; Disney will launch a streaming service later this year, competing directly with giants like Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL) in the online TV-on-demand space. The Disney Vault – a giant well of fully-owned content of proven popularity – will undoubtedly give the Mouse a leg up in that competition.5-star analyst Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial reviewed Disney last week and affirmed his upbeat outlook on the stock. He believes a recent pullback in share price offers investors a point of entry, and writes, “[We see] the company's continued accelerating business performance from its strong studio results and expect the ramp of its DTC streaming service to generate increasing return on capital. This stock is in our Research Focus List and also our Focus Opportunity Portfolio. Management is still investing significant cash in new growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions.”Of the four stocks in this list, Disney is the one with a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The stock has received 11 buys and 3 holds over the past three months, a clear sign of investor confidence. The average price target of $156 suggests an upside potential of 14% from the share price of $136.Visit TipRanks’ Analysts Top Stocks page to find out which companies have the attention of Wall Street’s best analysts.",4 Defensive Dividend Stocks for Steady Returns

2019-09-06,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond bankers from London to New York and Tokyo have never had such an abrupt transition from leisurely summer lunches to scarfing down sandwiches at their desks.September typically marks a return to busier issuance, but this year has been unprecedented as borrowing costs slide. Companies including Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Apple Inc., major Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group and Italian natural gas firm Snam SpA sold at least $150 billion-equivalent of bonds this week in dollars, euro and yen, the most ever in the first week of September.The rush is all the more striking after an especially slow August, when sales stagnated due to the U.S.-China trade war, slowing global economic outlook and turmoil in Hong Kong. Developments this week helped temper those concerns: China and the U.S. agreed to trade talks early next month, data bolstered confidence in the American economy and Hong Kong’s leader formally withdrew an extradition bill that had sparked weeks of protests.Read more about the bond bonanza in the U.S. hereFew are willing to forecast how long the binge may last, particularly given how President Donald Trump’s tweets have whipsawed financial markets in recent weeks. Protesters planned more gatherings in Hong Kong, and Fitch Ratings downgraded the city as an issuer of long-term, foreign currency debt for the first time since 1995, citing the political turmoil.But for now borrowers around the world are loading up on cheap money while they can.“The global primary pipeline has surged back to life, with investment-grade issuers looking to take advantage of low Treasury yields and tight spreads,” said Mark Reade, head of fixed-income research at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong. “Asian issuers are no exception, with regional sentiment having received an additional boost from confirmation of further U.S.-China trade talks in early October.”Here are some highlights around the world:In AsiaJapan had one of the busiest days ever for pricing of yen company bonds on Friday, with about 1.7 trillion yen ($16 billion) of domestic and global yen notes sold, after borrowing costs there dropped near a three-year low.Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc. priced a 430 billion yen six-part offering, the biggest yen bond sale by a non-Japanese borrower.In Hong Kong, after the city’s leader Carrie Lam formally withdrew the bill allowing extraditions to China earlier this week, local firms Wharf Real Estate Investment Co. and Far East Consortium International Ltd. rushed to sell debt.Average yields on investment-grade dollar bonds from Asia rose Thursday but remain close to their lowest in three years.Sales are rebounding after orders for Asia dollar bonds slumped to the lowest in 11 months in August.In the U.S.In the U.S., firms are borrowing $74 billion in the investment-grade bond market this week, the most for any comparable period since records began in 1972. Sales over three days this week nearly exceeded issuance in all of August.The frenzy included Walt Disney Co. and Coca-Cola Co.Investment-grade issuance is now down just about 2% from the same point last year. In June, the gap was closer to 13%.Companies now are by and large refinancing maturing debt, instead of funding big new capital projects.In EuropeNon-financial companies are on track to sell more than 20 billion euros of notes in Europe this week for the first time since March 2018.Oil-services giant Schlumberger Ltd. joined the rush on Friday with a three-part 1.5 billion-euro deal.Danaher Corp. sold the region’s second-biggest corporate deal this year on Tuesday, with a 6.25 billion-euro five-part sale to help fund the purchase of General Electric Co.’s bio-pharma business.Investment-grade borrowers, which had lagged their high-yield peers earlier this year, are now taking advantage of low Treasury yields to sell bonds, according to Anne Zhang, head of fixed income for Asia at JPMorgan Private Bank.(Adds August U.S. sales total in sixth bullet.)&#92;--With assistance from Finbarr Flynn, Adrian Yim, Ayai Tomisawa, Neil Denslow, Molly Smith and Caleb Mutua.To contact the reporters on this story: Denise Wee in Hong Kong at dwee10@bloomberg.net;Kyungji Cho in Seoul at kcho54@bloomberg.net;Rebecca Choong Wilkins in Hong Kong at rchoongwilki@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Andrew Monahan at amonahan@bloomberg.net, ;Neha D'silva at ndsilva1@bloomberg.net, Michael PattersonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",A $150 Billion Global Corporate Bond Binge Smashed Records
2019-09-06,"Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) announced September 4 that it sold its 10.5% stake in Green Organic Dutchman Holdings (OTCMKTS:TGODF) for gross proceeds of CAD $86.5 million or CAD $3 a share. Owners of Aurora Cannabis stock will be pleased to learn the sale resulted in a 50% internal rate of return. Source: Shutterstock In addition, it still holds warrants to buy another 16,666,667 shares of TGODF that are exercisable at $3 share. With the stock currently trading around $3, it's going to be a while before ACB could cash in those warrants. In the meantime, Aurora has more than $40 million in pre-tax profits to put to work. Here's where I think the owners of ACB stock will get the most bang for their buck.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips These Pretzels Are Making Me ThirstyI couldn't resist the Seinfeld reference but the one area where Aurora has been slow to the party is in the cannabis-infused drinks market.   * 7 Stocks to Buy In a Flat Market Sure, it won't be able to legally sell these drinks in its Canadian home market until mid-December of this year, but that's left it with plenty of time to organize a game plan for the drinks market. It's disappointing that it hasn't.Instead, Aurora is going to focus on vape pens and concentrates for its growth beyond the dried flower.  &quot;You're going to start seeing people shift over from the illicit market, the minute vape pens become available. And we have a head start on that,&quot; Aurora Chief Corporate Officer Cam Battley said in June. Given the recent health concerns about vaping that have cropped up in 16 U.S. states suggests that the failure to have a backup plan could hurt Aurora in the near term. Long term, I'm sure the vaping issues will get sorted, but there is definitely more investigation to be done. However, Aurora's lack of cannabis-infused drinks is a big reason why I'm (pardon the pun) high on both Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Hexo (NYSE:HEXO), whose Big Alcohol partners bring knowledge and distribution capabilities to the table, making them attractive cannabis investments in my opinion. Don't get me wrong. There's a lot to like about Aurora. Here's what I said about it in August:&quot;Aurora Cannabis continues to use its industry-leading size in both Canada and abroad to capture a big part of the global cannabis market. The fact that it doesn't have a U.S. business plan at the moment doesn't mean it won't enter the market in the future.&quot;&quot;Furthermore, while it doesn't have a huge strategic partner, if it continues to implement innovative ideas such as cultivating outside, I don't think it will have a problem attracting a huge strategic investor.&quot;  Why Not Partner With Coke?Back in 2018, Aurora held talks with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) but those seemed to have fizzled out. However, the fact that it recruited billionaire Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Fund Management has several high-profile consumer goods investments, to help guide the company through its ongoing growth suggests that it might reconsider a partnership with a company such as Coke in the future. In my opinion, the owners of Aurora Cannabis stock would be well served by the company reconsidering its stance on cannabis-infused drinks. I can say with certainty that my age group (mid-50s) are far more inclined to try THC/CBD drinks or edibles than they are vapes or dried flower. If you haven't smoked cigarettes your entire life or for many years, why would you start with weed? You wouldn't.  The Bottom Line on Aurora StockYou can't be all things to all people. That I get. So, it makes sense that Aurora's focused its efforts on products that have done well in the U.S. states where recreational pot is legal. However, tastes can change. Few have delivered cannabis-infused drinks that taste good. If Canopy or Hexo can break through that barrier, I'm confident they'll roll those drinks out across the U.S. as more states and the feds legalize pot.   * 7 Triple Threat Growth Stocks to Buy for the Long Term In the meantime, all Aurora can do is hope that they don't. A better plan would be to join the party. It's got 40 million reasons to do so.  At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-11,"A few weeks ago I shared an opinion on Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) stock when it had upside potential. The celebration was short since after a just a brief pop, the whole cannabis sector fell apart in heavy selling. ACB, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Cronos (NYSE:CRON), and ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (NYSEARCA:MJ) stocks all fell 10% to 20% in a matter of hours.Needless to say, consequently, the ACB stock bulls left a $3 potential spike on the table. The good news is that they have since found footing and now again there is another upside opportunity in the making.The pot stocks are still in the process of recovering the losses. Aurora Cannabis stock looks relatively strong among them in this effort. Even with its recent misfortunes, Aurora Cannabis stock is still up 21% year-to-date. So a few bad days on a chart don't necessarily kill the whole story of a stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September In my last Aurora Cannabis stock write-up, I also noted that equities in general were headed into geopolitical headline hell, so it was a risky trade at the time. The idea was that ACB had support below $6 per share so that the bulls had a solid base from which to spring.The good news is that this latest test proved that support held. In spite of resistance above, there should be another attempt at a rally in ACB stock even from here. Aurora Cannabis Stock Still Eyeing $8For almost four months, Aurora Cannabis stock has slid inside a descending channel of lower highs and lower lows. This last dip from mid-August may have forced the issue because it formed a short-term bottom.If so, then all the ACB bulls need to do is maintain a series of higher highs to close above $6.4 per share. Then they would retake the reins and have the opportunity to finally breakout from the descending trend. The result would be the opportunity to target $8 per share or higher. Aurora Cannabis is a momentum stock so it runs fast enough that they could plow through resistance.I caution against heavy conviction in this trade. The fundamentals for ACB and the entire sector are horrendous. ACB stock sells at 140 times sales so it is very bloated from the traditional sense. Unless the investor knows otherwise, I treat this like a trade and not an investment and set tight stops.The important levels below are between $5.9 and $5.6 per share. Below that and ACB could easily lose another dollar, so traders need to be nimble on bad days. Because just like there is upside potential to $8, there is downside risk to $5 or lower.The mid-term technical oscillators and price-to-moving-averages relationships support the theory that there is an upswing in momentum brewing: One that could fuel this rally in Aurora Cannabis stock. Experts in the field remain unanimous in their optimism.But again I caution about the nature of the opportunity. This is a speculative stock. Unless the timeline is long for the bet, traders need to be spry and aware of the levels. Bottom Line on ACB StockThese are risky stocks. This is nothing against ACB, but this industry didn't even exist just mere months ago. Furthermore, it is still illegal in the United States. Yes, there are states that have legalized marijuana but the federal government still has not followed suit.The enthusiasm on Wall Street for these stocks stems from the wide application for cannabis. Recreational use is already popular but investors' interests extend far beyond that. Companies from all industries are interested in cannabis including the medical, cosmetics, dermatology, beverage, food, and many more industries. It's only a matter of time before it finds its way to retail store shelves.Long term, the game changer source of optimism will probably be a favorable change in U.S. federal law. Imagine what ACB stock and its brethren would do if the U.S. follows Canada and legalizes cannabis nationwide.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

2019-09-11,"Shares of global beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) have been on a huge run in 2019 as investors have looked to play defense against the backdrop of slowing global economic expansion, escalating trade tensions and plunging global yields. Year-to-date, KO stock is up about 15% -- marking the stock's best nine-month stretch in over three years.Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com But here's an interesting fact which may dampen enthusiasm in the bull camp. The last time KO stock was this hot for this long was back in May 2016. Over the subsequent nine months into February 2017, Coca-Cola stock lost nearly 10%.In other words, the last time KO stock was this hot for this long, it went cold. Naturally, the question now becomes: Will history repeat itself?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI think so. At current levels, Coca-Cola stock looks overextended for three big reasons. First, the fundamentals underlying KO stock have a tough time justifying a $55 price tag. Second, the favorable optics, which have pushed KO stock higher year-to-date, could turn unfavorable in 2020. Third, the technicals point to the idea that KO stock is out over its skis in the near term.The best of KO stock may be in the rear-view mirror. Going forward, a stretched valuation, deteriorating optics and extended technicals will challenge KO stock. KO's Valuation Is Due for CompressionThe valuation underlying Coca-Cola stock is stretched in the near term and due for compression.In the big picture, Coca-Cola is a winner. The company has found a winning formula of leveraging its robust access to beverage consumption data to identify secular shifts in the global beverage industry. Coca-Cola then identifies up-and-coming brands aligned with those secular shifts, invests in them, gives them global distribution, sees which ones do well on a global scale and then wholly acquires those winners.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September At the end of the day, Coca-Cola is basically just a global beverage brand aggregator which, through data-driven mergers and acquisitions, will forever be at the epicenter of the global beverage industry.That's the good news. The bad news is that this industry is just a mid-single-digit growth industry. Coca-Cola's margins are largely maxed out, and KO stock trades at a rather rich 24-times forward earnings multiple. Modeling that out, Coca-Cola reasonably projects as a roughly 5% revenue grower and roughly 10% profit grower over the next several years (after considering buybacks). That pegs 2025 earnings per share near $3.50.Based on a soft drink stock average 24-times forward multiple, that implies a 2024 price target for KO stock of $84. Discounted back by 7% per year (three points below 10% to account for the yield), that equates to a 2019 price target of about $55 -- implying zero upside potential over the next few months. The Optics Could Turn SourOne of the big drivers of Coca-Cola stock's outperformance in 2018 and 2019 has been investor fear.Specifically, over the past 18 months, there has been an exceptional rise in investor pessimism regarding future economic growth prospects, mostly thanks to escalating trade tensions and slowing global economic expansion. As investors have grown fearful of future economic growth prospects they have piled into safe haven assets. Coca-Cola is widely perceived as one such safe-haven stock, mostly because regardless of which way the global economic winds blow, consumers everywhere still have to drink.This fear-driven tailwind could dry up soon and reverse course in 2020.This is thanks to two things. First, trade tensions are calming. While it is unlikely that a resolution is right around the corner, it's also unlikely that either side ups the ante much more going forward. Second, the global economy is starting to show signs of life again. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's global composite leading indicator is showing signs of stabilization through moderating declines. At the same time, central banks globally are cutting rates and considering stimulus programs.The global economy may actually reaccelerate in late 2019 and into 2020. If it does, investors will unwind their fear-driven trades. One such trade was piling into KO stock, despite the extended valuation. As that trade unwinds, KO stock could drop over the next few months. Coca-Cola Stock May Be Approaching a PullbackOver the past several years, KO stock has traded within a well-defined band, with a support line of higher lows and a resistance line of higher highs. Any time the stock has plunged below the support line, it has rebounded. Any time the stock has soared above the resistance line, it has sold off.Right now, KO stock is breaking above the resistance line in a big way. Either Coca-Cola stock is breaking out of this trading range and is ready to establish a new uptrend, or the stock is due for a pullback towards the support line.Given the unfavorable fundamentals and optics, I think the right interpretation of the technicals here is the latter. Bottom Line on KO StockCoca-Cola stock is a great long-term investment. But, in the near term, the fundamentals, optics and technicals all imply that KO stock is overextended. As such, while KO stock will move higher in the long run, the next big move in the stock will likely be lower, not higher.As of this writing, Luke Lango did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock is more expensive than PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) in most value metrics for the two companies' valuations in relation to their sales, earnings and cash flow.Source: Elvan / Shutterstock.com For example, KO trades at 24 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio. It also is valued at 25.1 times enterprise value to EBITDA. By contrast, PEP trades at 23 times earnings and has an EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 17.1.Another example is that the market values KO stock's enterprise value at 8.2 times its sales, whereas PEP is at 3.4 times EV-to-sales.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Differences with Dividends and YieldsKO stock has a slightly higher dividend yield than PEP. Coca-Cola stock yields 2.9% and PepsiCo's yield is 2.8%.However, KO spends more of its earnings on dividends, paying out 77.4%. PEP pays out only 68.4 % of its earnings-per-share in dividends.If PEP paid out 77.4% in dividends like KO, its dividend per share would be 13.1% higher -- $4.32 annually. So at today's price of ~$136.36, PEP's dividend yield would be higher than KO's -- 3.17% vs. KO stock's 2.94%.Moreover, KO has grown its dividends at only 6.85% during the past five years. PepsiCo dividends have grown faster at 9.88% over the same period. And remember PEP pays out less of its earnings, so its growth rate would be even higher on a comparable payout basis.  * 10 Big IPO Stocks From 2019 to Watch  PEP's Total Return Has Been Better Than KO, Despite Being CheaperNormally you would think that since KO stock is more expensive than PEP its stock performance would have been better than PEP's. But over the past year, KO stock has risen 19% and PEP has risen 20%. So PEP has outperformed Coca-Cola by 5.37%.Even more interesting is that PEP's total return has also been better. Remember that KO has a higher dividend yield than PEP -- 2.94% (KO) vs. 2.81% (PEP). If you add in the actual dividends declared over the past year, KO has paid out $1.59 per share in dividends. One year ago KO's price was $46.02, so the dividends paid earned investors 3.46%.PEP declared $3.765 per share in dividends over the past year. Based on the year-ago price of $113.85, these dividends earned investors 3.31%.On a total return basis, Coca-Cola stock earned investors 22.46% (19 % price appreciation plus 3.46% in dividends). But PEP earned their investors 23.34% (20.03 % plus 3.31%).So, even though PEP is cheaper than KO stock and has a lower dividend yield, investors in PepsiCo would have made 3.89% more on their investment than those in Coca-Cola stock, including dividends. Why Has PEP Outperformed KO Stock?The answer here is mixed. In Q2, Coca-Cola grew its EPS 12% over the past year in Q2. PepsiCo's EPS grew 13%.But both companies also measure their earnings on an &quot;organic&quot; basis, which strips out currency effects and other non-comparable distortions. KO's organic EPS was up 6% but PEP had 0% growth.The measure I like to look at is free cash flow (FCF). This is a measure of actual cash flow returns. Based on my analysis, Coca-Cola had an amazing 46.5% increase over the past year. PepsiCo's FCF grew a respectable 35.7%.But even that measure is not a perfect comparison. For example, PEP spent a much larger amount of money on capital expenditures, in both dollar volume and as a percent of sales, than Coca-Cola -- effectively investing for future performance. If the two capex numbers are put on a comparable basis, PepsiCo's FCF growth would be as good as Coca-Cola's.So by some measures, Coca-Cola performed better than PepsiCo, and in others, PepsiCo outperformed. There is no clear winner here.Maybe the difference between the two companies is how they see the future. Future Guidance for the Companies Is Very SimilarKO indicated that its EPS is likely to be -1% to +1% higher in 2019 over 2018. PepsiCo has guided to a 1% lower EPS number for 2019.These are not big differences.  * 7 Discount Retail Stocks to Buy for a Recession In fact, the only real difference I can see between the companies is that that PEP's stock is significantly cheaper than KO's stock valuation. I pointed this out at the beginning of this article. SummaryPEP's stock is cheaper and outperformed KO stock. There is not much difference in their financial performance.I suspect PEP is therefore likely to perform better than KO stock on a total return basis over the next year.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-12,"Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) has bounced back by 16.3% so far in September after a brutal sell-off over the past few months. I recommended Canopy Growth stock back on Au. 30. I felt the stock had been oversold given how little its fundamental picture has changed.Source: Shutterstock A brand new report on Canadian cannabis market share seems to confirm the idea that Canopy is dominating the nascent Canadian market. Experienced investors know a first-mover advantage is extremely valuable in the long-term.One of the biggest reasons why CGC stock has dropped in the past few months is because its losses have been heavier than expected. However, the early market share numbers suggest Canopy's strategy of aggressively investing in ramping up its business is already paying off.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The NumbersBank of America found Canopy has a 25% market share of all cannabis listings in Canada. The study included 1,980 listings, 101 brands and 39 different cannabis producers.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September Canopy Growth Corp has the largest share of the Canadian market by a long shot. Analyst Christopher Carey says Canopy's market share is roughly double the 13% market share of its closest competitors, Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) and Organigram (NASDAQ:OGI).Carey says establishing that first-mover advantage is critical.&quot;Establishing distribution - early and big - can be significant in creating long-term market share moats for a business competing in new consumer categories prone to fragmentation,&quot; he said.Unfortunately, the market share study wasn't all good news for Canopy Growth stock. The 25% &quot;share of listings&quot; represents product already on shelves throughout Canada. Bank of America also looked at &quot;sell-in,&quot; or total retail purchases of cannabis. Sell-in represents the future share of listings. In that statistic, Canopy has dropped to second place with 22%, trailing Aurora at 27%. The Future of CannabisCarey says investors shouldn't get too worried about Canopy losing sell-in share. In the June quarter, Canopy's harvest jumped 183% quarter-over-quarter, much of which was hot-selling THC flower.Carey is expecting this spike in harvest will translate to a 33% quarterly increase in Canopy sell-in in the fiscal second quarter of 2020. That big push could push Canopy back ahead of Aurora in sell-in share.Obviously having that top market share spot is ideal, but as long as Canopy remains at or near the top, investors should be rewarded in time. Certainly, investors want Canopy Growth to be the Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) of cannabis, but it will be just fine if Canopy Growth stock ends up the PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) of Canadian cannabis.In fact, PEP stock has generated a total return of more than 2,630% over the past 30 years. KO stock has a total return of 2,570% in that time. How to Play Canopy Growth StockThe latest Canadian market share numbers were certainly good enough to keep Carey in the bull camp when it comes to CGC stock.&quot;Canopy remains a company, if a still imperfect story, with a chance at becoming a leading global player in cannabis, especially given its industry leading [balance] sheet and partnership,&quot; he said.Bank of America has a &quot;buy&quot; rating and $27.66 price target for Canopy Growth stock.If you are a cannabis investor that believes the industry is just getting started, I think you can't go wrong owning Canopy Growth stock. My only recommendation would be to hedge your bets by owning ACB stock and at least two or three other cannabis stocks as well.As much as you love Canopy Growth stock and think Canopy will end up as the Coke or Pepsi of cannabis, it is still extremely early in the cannabis game. Especially in the event of U.S. legalization, there will be plenty of demand to support multiple market winners.It's likely most of the smaller names can't beat out Canopy Growth Corp and Aurora directly. But they might make appealing buyout targets down the line.I would recommend all cannabis investors buy Canopy Growth stock, ACB stock and at least two more of their favorite cannabis plays for a more diversified approach to the market.As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-13,"(Bloomberg) -- The China-U.S. trade war threatens to upend the supply chains of multinational technology companies. But smaller businesses are also getting caught up in the dispute.U.S. startups seeking funding must now consider relations between Beijing and Washington. According to one, that means turning away from Chinese investors and overseas cash in general in favor of raising money in the U.S. It could also accelerate the need to go public, according to Ripcord Inc. founder Alex Fielding.“Would I say that there was any risk from any investment that we took from a Chinese fund? No. I think they’re all great investors. It’s good money from good people and banks that are well known. This isn’t terrorist money,” he said. “Is there risk to Ripcord as a company for taking it? There is now.”Ripcord, which uses robots and artificial intelligence to scan and classify paper documents, previously got financing from sources including the venture capital arms of Chinese search leader Baidu Inc. and Beijing-based conglomerate Legend Holdings Corp. Now Fielding is looking for new investment to help the Hayward, California-based startup expand overseas. The trade war stands in his way.Instead of expanding to China and raising more money there, Ripcord’s first international move is to enter Japan via a new branch in Tokyo that will work with a large bank. And Fielding is eyeing cash from U.S. strategic investors with the ability to commit more in further rounds as needed. That should give Ripcord more time to grow before turning to public markets, he said.Decisions like this are part of the reason Chinese investment in U.S. startups is falling. There have been 25 rounds with at least one China-based investor so far in the third quarter, down from a peak of 67 in the second quarter of 2018, according to market tracker Preqin.Ripcord, whose clients include Coca-Cola Co., has carved out a niche by digitizing information on paper so it can be loaded into corporate data bases. Its 30,000-square-foot-factory space in the San Francisco Bay area houses giant machines that the startup builds itself. Ripcord has the equipment made domestically by U.S. companies. That’s more expensive than outsourcing to Asia, but more prudent in this new environment, he said.The problem with a greater association with China is that the U.S. administration could decide to classify a Ripcord investor or partner as a security risk, which could be fatal for the startup, according to Fielding.“There’s a lot of companies that are probably in that boat, weighing: Do we take a local investment that’ll cost us more than a foreign investment when there’s risk that comes with that?” he said. “It was never a part of the narrative, and now it is.”For Ripcord, Fielding believes the extra maneuvering will be worth it because he sees such a big opportunity. About 49 trillion sheets of paper are printed annually. Ripcord has scanned hundreds of millions of sheets this year and will pass 1 billion sheets next year.To contact the reporter on this story: Ian King in San Francisco at ianking@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Alistair Barr, Mark MilianFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Growing Up in a Trade War: China Is Off Limits for This Startup

KO stock's 2.92% stands tall compared to the 10-year yield, which is plumbing to the depths near 1.75%.And it is this juicy dividend that options traders have to thank for Thursday's explosive volume. The boom in call volume was driven by investors seeking short-term control of the stock for eligibility to the upcoming 40 cent quarterly payment. KO is trading ex-dividend this morning requiring you to have owned it by yesterday's close to participate in the next pay-day.As is usual with dividend targeting, calls drove the bus with activity zooming to 721%. In total, 206,418 contracts changed hands with 95% of the tally coming from calls.Implied volatility pushed to 20% landing it at the 29th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are baking in daily moves of 69 cents or 1.3%. Square (SQ)The broad market is a whisker from record highs, but some sick stocks are sinking toward 52-week lows. You can count Square shares among the ill. SQ fell for the fifth straight day yesterday amid increasing distribution.And the charts leave little room for optimism moving forward. The next potential support zone isn't until $52.50, which is 9% lower. While buyers could swoop in to the save the stock before then, I certainly wouldn't bet on it with every major moving average now pointing lower.On the options trading front, puts outpaced calls by a slim margin. Total activity climbed to 250% of the average daily volume, with 159,984 contracts traded. Puts accounted for 52% of the sum.Despite the deterioration, we've seen virtually zero fear. Implied volatility just sank to 39% or the 6th percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are cheap, so if you're banking on the bears, long puts or put spreads are attractive. Intel (INTC)Intel is on the rise, notching its seventh straight daily gain yesterday. The nascent recovery has been strong enough to pull the 20-day and 50-day moving averages higher. This confirms buyers have officially wrested control of the short- and intermediate-term trends.INTC stock now stands at a critical juncture; $53.25 is a powerful resistance zone that has kept a lid on INTC ever since April's disastrous earnings drop. Tack on the fact that Intel shares are extremely overbought and this is as logical a level as any for the stock to pause. At any rate, it's not a low-risk entry, so I'd caution against piling in here. A pullback would provide a better spot to jump in.  * 7 Stocks to Buy to Ride the Vegan Wave As far as options trading goes, puts proved more popular despite the day's rally. Activity swelled to 155% of the average daily volume, with 101,473 total contracts traded; 56% of the trading came from puts.Anxiety has been easing alongside the price rally. Implied volatility has fallen to 25% or the 23rd percentile of its one-year range. Premiums are pricing in daily moves of 83 cents or 1.6%.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Surging oil prices, thanks to an attack in the Middle East, sparked concern of a ripple effect.Source: Shutterstock Overstock.com (NASDAQ:OSTK) was the proverbial problem child, falling more than 20% to log a second day of losses following last week's big runup. Ford (NYSE:F) fell a more nominal 1.6%, with investors digesting the response to a recent UAW threat to go on strike, in addition to news that the company is recalling more than 300,000 Explorers due to dangerous seat edges.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy Headed into today's trading action, it's the stock charts of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Visa (NYSE:V) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) that have earned a closer inspection. Here's why, and what to look for.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Coca-Cola (KO)It has been one of the healthier trades this year, despite the drinking public's growing aversion to sugary beverages. In fact, Coca-Cola shares have rallied an amazing 20% since March's low, overcoming its February stumble with relative ease.The sheer speed and span of the move in an environment that doesn't favor most of the company's fare, however, has left KO stock vulnerable to some profit-taking. One more technical misstep could push Coca-Cola shares over that edge.  *   Click to EnlargeThe &quot;edge&quot; in question is the straight-line support that connects the bulk of the lows seen since March's pivot. It's plotted as a dashed blue line on both stock charts.  * KO shares are no stranger to big swings. In fact, they make them on a rather reliable basis. All of the recent cases where the weekly chart's RSI line entered overbought territory led to major setbacks.  * Although up for the past couple of months, take note of the fact that there's been more bearish volume than bullish volume.  * The purple 50-day moving average line may also be a make-or-break support level at this time. It has been in the past. Southwest Airlines (LUV)Airline stocks are inherently erratic, impacted not just by the ebb and flow of demand for travel, but by the ebb and flow of oil prices. The two differing factors don't always behave with respect to one another as one might expect. Southwest Airlines has been no exception to this norm.There has been a method to the madness though. LUV stock has hammered out the formation of a familiar and telling shape. And, it has done so with a fairly predictable context that implies a breakout thrust could be brewing.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip   *   Click to EnlargeThe bigger-picture pattern is a converging wedge shape, marked in blue lines on both stock charts. The lower edge of the wedge patterns, as can only be seen on the weekly chart, extends all the way back to 2015.  * There's also something important but easy to overlook in the moving average lines plotted on both stock charts. They're all essentially converged now, setting the stage for a divergence from this point forward.  * Tilting the scales in a bullish direction is the high-volume gains that started to materialize last week, and the subsequent push above a not entirely perfect upper boundary of the wedge shape. Visa (V)Finally, Visa has dished out some unexpectedly lengthy and sizable rallies since the beginning of 2017. In fact, the only real rough patch was the weakness most other stocks suffered in the final quarter of last year. And even then, V stock snapped back to an even stronger rally.As could be expected though, the weight of that eight-month gain is starting to prove unbearable. Visa shares have been hit hard a couple of times since last month, and while the advance hasn't been shattered yet, it's nearing that point.  *   Click to EnlargeThe weekly chart puts things in perspective. Last week's high had V shares more than 17% above the 200-day moving average line marked in white on both stock charts. That's the biggest divergence in years.  * The line in the sand, so to speak, is the 100-day moving average line marked in gray.  * Possible landing points include the $156.70 area marked in yellow on the daily chart, where V shares found support a couple of times in May, and then the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement line at $162.16, marked on the weekly chart.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-18,"Although not a pure cannabis play, New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) has had to deal with the same volatility. Since January's opening price, NBEV stock has dropped a staggering 37%. However, the downfall isn't due to a lack of trying.Source: Shutterstock Early this year, NBEV announced an addition to its Marley-branded beverages called Marley+CBD. Infused with cannabidiol or CBD, the cannabis compound brought a therapeutic element to the artisanal beverage series. Plus, the positive notoriety associated with CBD gave New Age Beverages stock a nice lift following the announcement.This past summer, New Age CEO Brent Willis showcased the company's Nhanced CBD line of oils, creams and lotions. Launched in Hong Kong, NBEV intends to expand into Japan and China next.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsUnfortunately, NBEV stock peaked in early February. From then on, save for some smatterings of good news, it's been all downhill for shares.That said, New Age Beverages stock appears to have found a bottom around the psychologically significant $3 level. Granted, most conservative investors should ignore this technical phenomenon. But for the speculators among you, NBEV might be an interesting play.In a strange way, I say this because of the current vaping crisis. Federal health agencies are investigating a recent spike of acute lung illnesses which they believe are associated with vaping. However, evidence suggests that illicitly sourced THC-infused vaping liquids are the real culprit.  * 10 Battered Tech Stocks to Buy Now In the context of companies like Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), the vaping crisis is a distraction. For the time being, it's probably kept NBEV stock in check, too. But in the long run, this issue may benefit New Age Beverages. Here's why: A Platform Crisis Will Give Way to CuriosityOne of the challenges of cannabis-based companies is overcoming the stigma associated with the plant. Typically, the term &quot;cannabis&quot; conjures up images of stoners smoking, or in this case vaping a joint.As my InvestorPlace colleague Will Ashworth noted, vaping or smoking products will always be a tough sell, irrespective of alleged health benefits. But products like beverages, oils and creams? That is a much more palatable situation, one that clearly favors New Age Beverages stock.Recently, I had a chance to sit down with corporate representatives John Weston and Paul Dibrito of cbdMD (NYSEAMERICAN:YCBD). During our conversation, we discussed the wide-ranging product diversity of the CBD and hemp space. For instance, cbdMD features ample ways to enjoy hemp-based therapies beyond vaping. They also have a pet product division called Paw CBD.What does this have to do with NBEV stock and the vaping crisis? No matter what's going on right now, an increasing number of people are interested in CBD for therapeutic use. Sure, the vaping platform might take a hit (no pun intended) from the present crisis. But the core substance itself has substantial support.Therefore, it's much easier to evangelize the benefits of hemp-based products to your family and friends when using socially appropriate platforms. You might not be able to roll a fatty for grandma, no matter how much she complains of pain. But a capsule or a refreshing beverage? That's much easier to swallow (pun intended).Plus, not everyone is healthy enough to smoke or vape. For instance, more than 25 million Americans have asthma. Vaping might not be the best choice for them. But a CBD-infused beverage, as far as I'm aware, is consumable by nearly everyone. NBEV Stock and Long-Term AmbitionsInterestingly, NBEV CEO Willis was formerly a Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) executive. As you might imagine, he's now a strong advocate of legal cannabis.But Willis' push to drive into Asia strikes me as extremely ambitious. When he mentioned Japan, I rolled my eyes. This is the country that arrested and deported former Beatle Paul McCartney.  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip Moreover, when Canada legalized recreational marijuana, the Japanese government issued a stern warning to its citizens living abroad: don't touch the stuff or risk severe penalties.In my opinion, this was an empty threat. However, it does demonstrate Japanese society's highly conservative viewpoint toward the cannabis plant.Naturally, this is an uphill battle for New Age Beverages and NBEV stock. At the same time, if you're going to break into Asia, doing so with CBD-infused beverages probably gives you the best chance of success.But as I said earlier, that sentiment should apply to almost anyone. New Age Beverages stock is incredibly risky. Due to its palatable platform, though, it might have an outside chance of delivering the goods.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-09-19,"Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoying a robust start to September, investors should remain leery. Aside from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war, we have the Brexit drama in the U.K. that could turn out ugly. Additionally, Germany is on the brink of a recession, if it's not there already. Logically, this doesn't bode well for certain market segments like consumer stocks to buy.If you've been paying attention to the global economy and not just our own indices, you'll appreciate that a cautious approach to investing is best. Early this year, South China Morning Post contributor David Brown suggested that international central banks must act quickly to quiet troubling economic conditions. Because that action apparently didn't happen, we're probably going to suffer some slowdown. Thus, consumer stocks levered to discretionary spending are suspect.However, I'm still interested in specific names of this far-reaching segment. While spending will likely slow over the next few months, it won't stop outright. Recession or not, people must make certain purchases, which means secular-industry consumer stocks to buy are very much in play.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, I'm eyeing some companies that have a vice element. Although it's an incredibly cynical argument, let's face reality: vice tends to go up during economic hardships. For example, imbibing overall increased during the Great Recession, likely as a stress-coping mechanism. * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession Here are seven consumer stocks to buy that can outlast the coming recession. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Soloviov Vadym / Shutterstock.com For several years, shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) languished in largely sideways trading. In retrospect, part of that probably had to do with the generally strong market and economic dynamics at the time. For example, in a robust bull market, a name like KO stock doesn't necessarily appeal to you. That's especially the case when you have high-flying technology companies competing for your attention.Now, the situation is different. Sure, KO stock is considered one of many consumer stocks, and in a downturn, consumers will reduce their spending. But as I mentioned earlier, they won't kill all consumptive behaviors, but rather, are more mindful of their expenditures. Here, Coca-Cola products are compelling because they offer a treat, a nice distraction away from stressful events or circumstances.And let's not forget that any form of cheap entertainment or distraction carries a premium in a recession. That was one of the main arguments supporting KO stock in the last major downturn. I believe a similar dynamic will support Coca-Cola in the next one. Campbell Soup (CPB)Source: HeinzTeh / Shutterstock.com While many investors have tuned into the Coca-Cola story this year, another name among consumer stocks to buy has made ripples, but perhaps without the same level of attention. Shares of Campbell Soup (NYSE:CPB) have soared this year, gaining over 45%. You'd have to go back quite a ways to when a bowl of soup was this interesting. Yet CPB stock might have room to fly.First, as strange as it is to say this, a recession would really help the case for CPB stock. If the economy slows, consumers will invariably whittle down their discretionary spending. Thus, the family budgeting for going out to eat should decline sharply. In addition, a particularly troublesome recession could see consumers cutting their personal budgets down to the bare essentials.Guess what? Campbell Soup is the bare essentials. * 7 U.S. Stocks to Buy With Limited Trade War Exposure Second, I like the fact that, like KO, CPB stock pays a dividend. And with a current yield of 3%, it gives concerned investors some buffer against potential volatility. Clorox (CLX)Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified)In the first two consumer stocks to buy, I featured consumables in the literal since. But with Clorox (NYSE:CLX), most of their products are not things you want to put in your mouth. That said, you might want to consider putting CLX stock in your portfolio. Let's take a look at some of the basics.For starters, most folks know the Clorox brand name as a household cleaning supply specialist. Here, the argument is simple: even in a recession, you've got to keep yourself and your environment clean. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure or more, especially with current healthcare prices.And this logic for CLX stock extends beyond human use. One of Clorox's brands is Fresh Step, which is a popular cat litter brand. Americans love their pets, often changing their lifestyles to accommodate their furry friends.Finally, CLX stock isn't just about cleaning nowadays. Through the Hidden Valley brand, Clorox has some exposure to the food industry. Additionally, its Burt's Bees division offers lucrative personal care revenue opportunities. Costco Wholesale (COST)Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com I'll admit that I struggled with whether to include Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) in this list of consumer stocks to buy. In a bull market, COST stock makes sense. Although it charges a membership fee, customers are more than willing to pay it. Indeed, mainstream comedies like Employee of the Month confirm that Costco is both a cultural and retail phenomenon.But will shoppers be willing to dish out money for the membership dues -- and the 800 gallons of mayonnaise -- in a bear market? After all, people don't just shop at Costco for the necessities. They also go there to buy ultra-high definition TVs and the latest digital gadgets. Plus, not everything in Costco is a great deal. In a downturn, that doesn't support the case for COST stock. * 10 Companies Making Their CEOs Rich However, here's an important stat to remember: $100,000. That's how much money the typical Costco shopper earns in a year. In contrast, the typical Walmart (NYSE:WMT) shopper earns a much lower $56,482. Thus, in a downturn, Costco's revenue stream is more resilient than its competitors, driving the case for COST stock. Genuine Parts Company (GPC)Source: Shutterstock If we do incur a serious recessionary crisis, consumers will most likely abandon high-dollar, longer-term purchases. That's an incredibly longwinded way of saying most folks probably won't shell out money for new cars. In turn, economic hardship will incentivize people to hold onto their vehicles longer. Invariably, this benefits Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) and GPC stock.Now, Genuine Parts may not be a household name. However, you almost surely heard of their brands like NAPA Auto Parts. With large warehouses stacked with various automotive parts, drivers can save themselves significant money by doing basic work themselves. Thanks to various do-it-yourself videos on platforms like Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, the investment proposition for GPC stock isn't as much of a stretch as you might think.Moreover, there's a chance that GPC stock could benefit from higher-than-average income earners who drive European -- specifically German -- cars. As an automotive enthusiast, I appreciate the many intangibles that German carmakers bring to the table. However, their cars are ridiculously expensive to maintain.To get around this dilemma, I can imagine cash-strained drivers buying third-party components for their vehicles. Therefore, I wouldn't ignore GPC in your search for best consumer stocks to buy. Anheuser Busch Inbev (BUD)Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com Perhaps one of the more surprising picks for consumer stocks to buy, shares of Anheuser Busch Inbev (NYSE:BUD) are actually performing very well this year. Since January's opening price, BUD stock has gained 50%. However, I think the fundamentals justify the enormous rally.First, entertainment or escapism comes at a premium during economic hardships, as I mentioned earlier. Now, it's true that technically, we're not in a recession. But some clues exist that we're headed there. For example, while the unemployment rate is at multi-year lows, this stat has never indefinitely stayed deflated. Plus, the August jobs report was disappointing, give all of us pause.However, that suggests some extra drinking off the job will occur, driving the case for BUD stock. * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession Second, Anheuser Busch owns the Bud Light brand, among other popular beers. Bud Light is the most popular beer in America by a long shot. Plus, it's incredibly cheap, which may help to steer recession-burnt and cash-strapped millennials back to beer from other frivolities. Logically, this boosts the case for BUD stock. Altria Group (MO)Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com Clearly, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) is the laggard in this list of consumer stocks to buy. On a year-to-date basis, MO stock is down 10%. Even worse, since the first of April of this year, shares are down nearly 25%.While declining interest in smoking has obviously hurt MO stock and its ilk, big tobacco has another concern: the ongoing vaping crisis. In short, a rash of acute lung illnesses which federal agencies believe is associated with vaping has impacted several states. So far, authorities are investigating six deaths that they presume relate to vaping.On the surface, that hurts MO stock because Altria has a 35% stake in Juul. At the center of the firestorm, anti-smoking advocates and politicians have blasted Juul for their marketing practices and their easily concealable products. Worst of all, the President threatened to ban flavored vaping liquids, which may decimate the industry.However, that creates all kinds of ugly that I don't have the space to detail comprehensively here. The big takeaway, though, is that it may do nothing to stop underage vaping because the proposed ban won't affect all vaping liquids. Moreover, banning vaping altogether may violate legal adult users' constitutional rights, as well as destroying an economically viable industry.Granted, this is a risky play. But if we have a reasonable resolution, which I think we will, MO stock could fly far higher than many other consumer stocks.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It seems that every day, how the market finishes is 100% based on what's going on with the trade war, what the Federal Reserve is doing, or just how good or bad the data has been. For conservative or investors near or in retirement, it can be maddening. Which is why utility stocks could be the best thing for their portfolios.After all, utility stocks feature plenty of steady cash flows and high dividends. It doesn't matter so much what the economy is doing as people still need to heat their homes, keep the water flowing, and power the lights. This steadfastness makes utility stocks a prime choice for conservative investors. And now with the Fed decreasing rates, other investors tend to like them too.No wonder why the sector proxy -- the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEArca:XLU) -- has gained over 21% year-to-date. That's before dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Dividend Stocks to Buy for a Recession As you can see, there is power in owning the power producers. For conservative investors, the sector's strength and boring nature really do pay plenty of benefits in a market like this. With that, here are five utility stocks worth buying today. Utility Stocks Perfect For Conservative Investors: UGI (UGI)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.58%For conservative investors looking at utility stocks, they should focus on the number 33. That's the number of consecutive years that utility UGI (NYSE:UGI) has managed to increase its dividend for. And given its recent moves, it should be able to add 34, 35, and so on to that impressive streak.The key is that UGI has been smartly using the utility holding company model to its advantage.UGI owns plenty of boring electric and gas operations in the Northeast. These regulated assets provide the utility stock with plenty of steady cash flows. The firm has been using these cash flows to fund non-regulated and tangential assets. These assets provide higher profit margins and an extra boost to its bottom line.A prime example would its recent buyout of Columbia Midstream Group. UGI already owned several FERC regulated interstate natural gas trunk lines in the region. With the addition of Columbia, the utility now gained several gathering and processing assets that feed into its pipeline system. This allows UGI to instantly see scale and additional profits.This strategy seems to be working for UGI. Last year was one of its best on record and the gains have continued this year as well. Adjusted EPS for last quarter -- after accounting for the buyout of its MLP subsidiary AmeriGas -- jumped more than 44% year-over-year.With profit gains like that, UGI should have no problems hitting its 4% annual dividend growth targets. York Water (YORW)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.77%If you had to guess what stock has been paying dividends the longest, names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) may come to mind. But the title goes to a small and overlooked utility stock that may just be perfect for conservative investors. We're talking about humble York Water (NASDAQ:YORW) and its dividend streak of 203 consecutive years.York has been paying a dividend since its founding in 1816. The key comes from its operating niche. Water utilities are often monopolies in their operating regions. Moreover, they are heavily regulated. In this case, YORW provides water and treatment for 48 municipalities with York and Adams Counties in Pennsylvania. What's great about York is that it really has tried to grow massive like some water utilities. It just does what it does. Because of this, its results run like clockwork.And York has been pretty successful at winning rate increases from regulators. The latest one was approved at the start of the year. Given water's highly regulated nature, these rate increases provide just enough oomph to pay for rising costs, upgrades and boost profits. And York has handed those profits back via dividend increases. The latest one was a 4.4% jump.  * 7 Stocks the Insiders Are Buying on Sale The reality is, YORW is not going to set your portfolio on fire and grow 1500%. But it what it can do is provide plenty of stability and income potential. Exactly what utility stocks should do. Consolidated Edison (ED)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 3.24%No list of stodgy utility stocks can be complete with Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED). ConEd has been providing electricity, steam and natural gas for metropolitan New York for more than 180 years. And it turns out this niche of powering New York City, Westchester and parts of New Jersey is a very good one to be in. Thanks to their growing populations, steady economies and overall top-notch fundamentals, ConEd has become a profit and dividend champion.And the growth could keep coming. That's because ConEd has started to upgrade and make its system more high-tech.For starters, that includes plenty of renewable and solar energy projects in its operating region. Con Edison is actually the second-largest solar energy producer in North America. Secondly, ConEd has begun to roll-out new smart-meters and demand-response programs. This includes across its electric and natural gas operations. Here, consumers are rewarded for using less power at peak times. But for ConEd, this can be huge cost savings.Already, the utility has been struggling to meet the needs of New Yorker's when it comes to gas demand. It's simply having to buy more gas from third party players to meet the demand. Those costs are hurting its bottom line. With demand response, ED should be able to save a few dollars and reduce its outlays for gas. Even better is that regulators have allowed the utility to pass on the smart-meter costs to consumers. For ED stock, it's a win-win.It's a big win for investors as well and should help keep the dividends flowing at ED for years to come. NextEra Energy (NEE)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.22%Speaking of renewable energy, no utility stock is better at it than NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). That's because like previously mentioned UGI, NEE has managed to use the utility holding company model perfectly.To start with, NextEra owns plenty of regulated utility assets in the sunbelt. These more than 4.6 million customers provide plenty of stable cash flows into its coffers and used those cash flows to build-out its non-regulated assets. More specially, NextEra has become the largest producer of solar and wind power in the United States. The best part is that renewable energy has finally hit parity with traditional fossil fuels in many cases. And given the lower costs to maintain a solar or wind farm, margins are getting quite juicy at NEE.NextEra is able to sell excess power produced at these solar farms to other utilities looking to meet new regulations or fill their own power needs. At this point, it's just easier for them to buy power from NEE than build a renewable energy farm on their own.For NEE this has meant plenty of profit growth over the years. Since 2003, EPS has managed to grow at a CAGR of nearly 8% per year. For a utility stock, that's a very strong rate of growth. And NextEra hasn't been shy about handing out excess cash to investors. Dividends have grown by over 9% in that time.  * 10 Recession-Resistant Services Stocks to Buy With its business model continuing to see benefits, NextEra represents one of the best utility stocks out there for investors. Vanguard Utilities ETF (VPU)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.73%As the saying goes, there's safety in numbers. To that end, a broader strategy may be best. Which is why investors may want to go with an ETF that covers the utility stocks. Surely, you could go with the previously mentioned XLU -- and it's a fine choice. But the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEArca:VPU) might be a better pick.The reason comes down to coverage. The XLU holds just 28 utility stocks. VPU, however, offers broader coverage given its inclusion of large-, mid- and small-cap firms. That wide-sweeping approach bumps its total number of holdings to 69 different utilities. This includes all of them on this list. Better still is that VPU also beats the SPDR on expenses -- 0.10% vs. 0.13% -- and in terms of current dividend yield.Those slight differences in holdings, yield, and expenses have made VPU the better fund for the long haul. Over the last decade, the Vanguard ETF has managed to return about 12.46% annually. That's just over a half a percent more per year than the SPDR. Investing is a game of inches and that slight difference compounded over time really adds up. And yet, asset and trading volumes for the VPU are equally as swift.As a result, VPU should get the nod from investors looking for a broader approach to utility stocks. Given the market's rising volatility, they may just want to do that.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-09-23,"With HEXO Corp. (NYSE:HEXO) firmly below the key $1 billion market capitalization, investors are at a loss on what to do next. Although HEXO stock is holding the $4 support line, its earnings report, estimated to take place on Oct. 3, might prove to be a turning point.Source: Shutterstock Ahead of the report, MKM Partners initiated coverage on a few cannabis companies last Friday, Sept. 20. It gave HEXO stock a buy rating, which sent the stock up that day. Howver, to get an idea on what to expect from HEXO's upcoming report, investors should look at the Q3 2019 report posted in June. Investors are Tired of WaitingHexo reported revenue growth of 944%, albeit at $9.76 million. Analysts expected $1 million but at this level, the absolute figures should not matter much. Hexo's vision of becoming a top-three global cannabis company is a secondary point. Cannabis stocks are simply out of favor.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSince peaking in May, stocks like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) and Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) are in a sustained downtrend. Investors have grown tired of waiting for profits to come. But that is the nature of a nascent industry that needs the big players to spend heavily on operating expenses. And while these companies continue to grow revenue at a blistering pace, the profits never seem to come.Why is Hexo stock different from all other cannabis companies, if at all?  * 7 Momentum Stocks to Buy On the Dip Hexo outlined three pillars that will deliver on its goal in becoming a top-three global cannabis firm, specifically, according to management's conference call comments: operational stability; product innovation; and, brand leadership. It invested in a strong team of scientists, chemists, and those with industry experience working at Kellogg's (NYSE:K) or Coca Cola (NYSE:KO). With 25 PhDs on staff, the R&D department is developing innovative products. To leverage its expertise, Hexo is partnered with Fortune 500 companies.The company secured around 200,000 kilograms of hemp supply for CBD and non-THC cannabinoid extraction for the fiscal 2020 year. It has a secondary supply agreement that adds 60,000 kilograms of hemp. The risk here is similar to that faced by other cannabis firms: it is waiting for the second stage of legalization in October in Canada -- the production and sale of edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals. Its strategy also relies on cannabis legalization in eight U.S. states in 2020. New Lows for HEXO Stock PossibleAt a recent price of $3.94, HEXO stock is down 53% from 52-week highs but is still up 30% from yearly lows. The increased selling pressure could send the stock to new lows. This may frustrate existing shareholders. Still, those willing to average down or to start on a speculative position could get a big reward. Cannabis legalization in the U.S., Canada, and in other countries will lead to revenue growth.Hexo has the title of being the first cannabis company to join the Food and Consumer Products of Canada, a leading national trade group. The company's added 374 new workers and raised its total headcount to 822 employees at the end of last quarter. It has 1,100 employees in total. CAD $400 Million Revenue TargetHexo has an ambitious CAD $400 million ($301.5 million) revenue target. It faces two risks in getting there. First, regulatory risks would delay the advancements of its products. More likely, regulatory delays will push out the company meeting its revenue target. Execution is the second risk. If its Belleville operations are ready in the fall as planned, Hexo will be mitigating that risk.  * 7 CBD Stocks to Buy That Are Still Worth Your Investment Dollars In Quebec, Hexo targets 30% share. But Hexo has a preferred supplier status in the region, a strong reputation, and a product its customers like.In the near-term, the company set a goal of a 40% gross margin. Longer-term, the company may achieve 50%. But to get there, it needs to be a top-four global cannabis company. Your Takeaway on HEXO StockInvestors have a number of financial models available to forecast the stock's fair value. But until Hexo starts generating consistently growing revenue each quarter, the estimate is a guess with a wide margin for error. Investors should instead wait for legalization and regulatory clarity first. This will remove some of the risks that may still not yet be priced in HEXO stock.Disclosure: As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-10,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Why should society permit the existence of food companies that contribute to poor health? The standard answer is that people should be allowed to make bad choices about what they eat and drink. But that’s a slippery defense when the consumers are children and the choices they face are loaded against their wellbeing, as Thursday’s British government report on childhood obesity makes clear.The snacks industry — from Mondelez International Inc. to Coca-Cola Co. and from Nestle SA to the Kraft Heinz Company — needs to rethink its purpose, and strategy, if its license to operate is to endure.Former U.K. chief medical officer Professor Sally Davies, the report’s author, cites multiple causes for a saddening rise in obesity among England’s 10-11-year-olds since 1990. The giant food brands are only part of the problem but that hardly absolves them from leading the solution. As Davies says, cheap unhealthy food tends to be the most readily available. Portion inflation is rampant. Advertising or sponsorship is pervasive. Healthy options are often unaffordable for those on low incomes, while the unhealthy options are cheap.Davies’s recommendations include some radical ideas. The U.K. public may be banned from eating and drinking on public transport. Industry faces calorie caps on food portions consumed “out-of-home,” tiered VAT on unhealthy food, plain packaging and the end of tax deductibility of marketing costs for unhealthy products. These may just be proposals. But the direction of travel is clear.This is what happens when an industry fails to self-regulate to mitigate its worst effects. Governments wake up. The food and drink industry is a big employer and a big taxpayer. Even so, the economics favor intervention. The medical costs of obesity, coupled with lost productivity, are 3% of global GDP, according to McKinsey research from 2014. Today’s unhealthy children are tomorrow’s sick workforce.The U.K. Food and Drink Federation, the lobby group, says “punitive action” might hinder continuing the progress the manufacturers have already made in cutting salt, sugar and calories from their products over the last four years. It says the industry must “take the consumer with us.” The question is whether it is taking itself and its customers to an early grave. The industry needs to see this problem as an opportunity not a threat. First, it should be clear about its role in society. Making treats that people want to eat can be a good reason for a corporation to exist, but not when it adds to a public health crisis. This doesn’t mean PepsiCo Inc. ending production of Doritos. But it does mean defining responsibly what the target market — and age group — is for such products. And it requires combining marketing with education.At the same time, food manufacturers should redouble their efforts to innovate healthier, cost-effective alternatives to sugar and salt. This is a chance for the food giants to think about the huge market for healthy snacks. Food technology has a vital role here and it’s best mediated by the private sector. R&D has already helped, as with the development of Nestle’s so-called hollow sugar.This week the OECD proposed reforms to corporate taxation, which would allow governments to tax digital companies that generate revenues in countries where they have no physical presence. The food industry faces a similar revenue challenge. Its products will be subject to extra taxes in certain markets until they start to use their well-funded research labs to help meet national health objectives.It’s not clear that the sector sees obesity as a strategic issue yet. Unilever NV is recycling plastic packaging but still aiming to sell lots more Ben & Jerry’s ice cream. The debate among investors about what stocks to divest centers on fossil fuels right now. If food companies don’t act, they’ll join tobacco and oil in the sin bin.&#92;--With assistance from Lara Williams.To contact the author of this story: Chris Hughes at chughes89@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2019-10-11,"Once again, the big news for the Dow Jones today was all about the U.S.-China trade get together. The result was excellent news for stocks as the major domestic equity benchmarks surged to end the week on news that the world's two largest economies reached a partial trade accord.Source: Venturelli Luca / Shutterstock.com As I've been noting over the course of this week, a smaller trade deal was an idea previously eschewed by President Trump, but he appeared to come around to the idea. Earlier today, the president said on Twitter &quot;good things&quot; were happening in the trade talks, even going so far as to describe the talks as &quot;warm.&quot;That's a significant, positive departure from Trump's often bellicose China rhetoric and stocks certainly liked those good vibes.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThose warm and fuzzy trade feelings are critical because the U.S. was set to impose tariffs on some Chinese goods as soon as next week with another batch of levies slated to go into effect in mid-December. Should President Trump sign the deal currently being discussed, those tariffs would be avoided and a broader trade truce could be reached by the two sides.With trade talks progressing nicely, the Nasdaq Composite surged 1.34%, while the S&P 500 soared 1.09%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.31% to finish the week with 27 of the Dow's 30 stocks in late trading. The offenders were defensive names -- Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) -- but losses for those names were modest. Apple at an All-Time HighShares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued their recently scintillating pace, gaining 2.74% to hit a record high. Of course, some today's Apple ebullience is attributable to good news on the trade front, but there was streaming news to consider as well. That's important because the Apple + streaming platform is close to its debut.  * 7 Beverage Stocks to Buy Now Apple +, which debuts on Nov. 1, could be a real thorn in the side of rival Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and be a major boon for Apple investors, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note out today.&quot;If Apple is successful with its latest streaming endeavor and reaches some of these potential subs/revenues numbers annually we estimate, this will add roughly $15 per share to our sum-of-the-parts valuation on Apple,&quot; said the analyst.He raised his Apple price target to $265 from $245. AAPL stock closed around $236 and with Apple in rally mode, expect more upward price target revisions because the average target on the name is just $228. Cyclical ContributorsStock-specific news was light today for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dow (NYSE:DOW), but those cyclical names were the Dow's top two performers today, each gaining more than 5% on the positive trade news.In either case, Friday's rallies in the names isn't an overreaction because both have displayed high sensitivity to trade headlines. Caterpillar's surge today was particularly impressive because it occurred on above-average volume. Straight to the BankThird-quarter earnings season is about to ramp up and that means an avalanche of reports from the financial services next week. Yes, the group is heading into earnings amid concerns about lower interest rates suppressing net interest margins, analyst downgrades and negative profit revisions.However, all of the Dow's financial services names gained today with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, gaining 1.69%. It's difficult to say bank stocks are buys right here, but the aforementioned negative factors are widely known and should be priced into these names at this point. A Swoosh HigherNike (NYSE:NKE), another member of the trade-sensitive club, added to recent gains today after Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu reiterated an &quot;outperform&quot; rating and $98 price target on the stock. That implies modest upside from the $94 area Nike closed at today.&quot;With the broader consumer shift towards digital, we think at some point Nike will rationalize its factory store footprint as it assesses each store's productivity,&quot; said the analyst. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayThere have been some earnings calls already and one issue that has been popping is currency exchange-traded rates. While interest rates have come down in the U.S., the dollar has been mostly firm this year and that's problematic for export-dependent sectors.  * 7 'A'-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 &quot;Foreign exchange has again been cited on the most earnings calls to date (12) as a factor that either had a negative impact on earnings or revenues in Q2 or is expected to have a negative impact on earnings and revenues in future quarters,&quot; according to FactSet. &quot;More than half (55%) of the S&P 500 companies that have conducted earnings conference calls to date for the second quarter have cited some negative impact from foreign exchange rates.&quot;Fortunately, part of the trade deal with China includes currency controls. Hopefully China keeps up its end of the bargain and doesn't devalue the yuan again.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Starting next year, Singapore will treat packaged sugary drinks such as Coca-Cola the way that other countries treat cigarettes. Advertisements will be banned, and a label attesting to a beverage's unhealthiness will be mandatory. The goal is to reduce the high rate of sugar consumption and associated health problems — such as diabetes and heart disease — that are now plaguing Southeast Asia.The problem is quickly getting worse. Between 2010 and 2014, obesity surged 24% in Singapore, 27% in Malaysia and 38% in Vietnam. Left unaddressed, this epidemic could exact steep human and financial costs. Banning ads for sugary drinks won't solve the problem on its own. But if Singapore thinks a bit more ambitiously, it might provide a model for other emerging and newly developed countries needing to slim down.It wasn't so long ago that much of Asia was associated with undernourishment. Thanks to a half-century of economic development and income growth, that’s no longer the case. Although hunger remains an issue in some areas, overall, Asians now have access to more and better food than ever — a fact reflected in rising life expectancies across the continent.But increased access to food isn't all good news. As incomes have risen, Asia's eaters have tended to shift away from traditional starch-based diets and toward food rich in fat, protein, dairy, and sugar, much of it packaged and processed. Calories that might've once been worked off in rural fields now accumulate on the hips and bellies of Asia's middle classes as they settle in cities by the tens of millions. Meanwhile, local food cultures that posed few health risks in less affluent times turn out to be problematic in an era of cheap calories. The fried snacks emblematic of Malaysian street food pose minimal health risks in moderation. But thanks to their low-cost ubiquity, they’re now helping to make the country, in UNICEF's words, “the fattest nation in Asia.”Then there's sugar. Even before low prices made sweets widely accessible, Southeast Asia had a sweet tooth. Now that it can be more easily indulged, consumption is skyrocketing. In Thailand, daily sugar intake has increased from 19 teaspoons a day in 1997 to 28 in 2019. Singapore is modest by comparison, with consumers averaging around 12 teaspoons a day, about half from beverages (a typical can of soda contains 10 teaspoons). But even that’s at the high end of the World Health Organization’s guidelines.The health effects associated with this shift, combined with other unhealthy nutritional trends, have been severe. Southeast Asia now accounts for about 20% of all diabetics globally. Over the past two decades, countries in the region have seen the world’s largest increases in premature deaths related to cardiovascular disease. Already, obesity-related ailments take up as much as 15% of Indonesia’s national health-care spending and 19% of Malaysia's.Faced with such an epidemic, Singapore's plan to ban advertising and mandate labeling certainly makes sense. But if the government really wants to reduce consumption, it’ll need to apply direct pressure on manufacturers and consumers by imposing taxes on the production and sale of sugary goods. In price-sensitive developing countries like Mexico, such taxes have proved effective in reducing consumption or changing manufacturers’ practices. In Malaysia, the mere threat of such a tax convinced F&N Beverages Marketing, one of the country's biggest drink manufacturers, to reformulate 70% of its products to avoid the price hike.Ultimately, developing countries will have to look beyond prepackaged goods. Informal street dining remains prevalent in most of these areas, and consumers seeking sugary snacks or fried food can simply frequent a stall and eat tax-free. Promoting healthy (or healthier) eating will require long-term public-education campaigns, ideally combined with school-based nutritional programs like the one Malaysia will be launching next year.None of this will be easy or cheap. But, as with a diet, the improved quality of life should ultimately pay for all the sacrifice.To contact the author of this story: Adam Minter at aminter@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Timothy Lavin at tlavin1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2019-11-01,"(Bloomberg) -- Over the past four decades, consumers around the world have chugged trillions of bottles of water from brands such as Perrier, Evian, Dasani, and Aquafina. Few realize that most of what they pay for is plastic and time on a truck. Companies typically get the water for free or just a nominal fee, and bottling the stuff and getting it to consumers—as well as advertising it—accounts for the bulk of their costs.Today, increasing concern about the carbon and plastic waste generated by that process is fueling a backlash that threatens the business. Across the industry, sales are softening and some towns are even banning plastic water bottles—spurring producers to respond with alternatives ranging from canned water to flavor pods for tap water to dispensers that sell sparkling and flavored mixes.“The waters business has to cope with a number of sustainability issues that are becoming increasingly important,” Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider told analysts in October.Until the 1970s, bottled water was mostly sold in limited areas by European companies that tapped springs in the Alps. Then in 1973, DuPont patented PET plastic bottles, which were cheaper, lighter, and stronger than the glass that had been the industry standard. Combined with the rapidly globalizing economy, PET allowed water sellers to ship their wares much farther, opening up new markets. Bottlers sprung up in just about every country and the likes of Nestle, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo added water to their portfolios, helping boost global revenue in the business to $130 billion last year, according to researcher Euromonitor.These days, things aren’t quite so bubbly as consumers grow increasingly aware of their carbon footprint. Danone, the maker of Evian, on Oct. 18 reported its biggest decline in quarterly water revenue in a decade. That same day, Coca-Cola Co. said water sales were lower than it expected.With shipments headed for a second annual decline, Nestle is reorganizing its bottled water business. Buffeted by lower-price rivals and high transport costs, Nestle raised prices—which sapped sales of its mass-market offerings such as Poland Spring and Pure Life as consumers shifted to cheaper generic brands. CEO Schneider has said the company wants to focus instead on higher-end products such as flavored and sparkling waters like its Perrier and San Pellegrino brands.More than 80 U.S. colleges and a handful of municipalities have restricted sales of bottled water. In Concord, Mass., it’s illegal to sell still water in small plastic bottles, and San Francisco bars such sales on city property. In the U.K., a non-profit called City to Sea has introduced an app that points thirsty users to places where they can get free water—with a pledge from chains such as Starbucks and Costa to refill bottles at no cost.“Producers face a real risk from the environmental movement, which has strong support among young people,” says Alain Oberhuber, an analyst at Mainfirst Bank, who predicts a sharp decline in sales of bottled water over the next two decades. “They know they have to do something.”With bottled water now outselling carbonated soft drinks in the U.S., one part of that “something” is aluminum cans filled with water. Coke introduced cans of Dasani in the northeast U.S. this year and plans to try selling it in aluminum bottles in 2020. Pepsi has been selling canned Aquafina at restaurants and stadiums and is testing it in stores. And Danone is trying the idea with local brands in Britain, Denmark, and Poland.The soda giants are also seeking to monetize consumption of tap water. Pepsi last year paid more than $3 billion for SodaStream, which produces systems for making fizzy water at home. And Pepsi has introduced a brand called Drinkfinity, which sells pods that attach to reusable bottles to infuse tap water with caffeine, vitamins, or electrolytes in a variety of flavors.  Coke is rolling out a water dispenser it calls Dasani PureFill, which allows consumers to refill their bottles with free filtered water and gives the option of adding flavors or carbonation for about $1 for a 20-ounce bottle. The company is planning to test the idea—and various prices—at roughly 100 locations such as offices, hospitals, and colleges.Nestle next year plans to introduce a dispenser it calls Refill Plus, which filters tap water and can add flavors and varying levels of carbonation,  and it’s working on a paper-based bottle that it says is fully biodegradable. Danone is exploring refill stations but for now is focusing on the home market with a new device that dispenses Evian delivered in balloon-like spheres that use less plastic than bottles.Producers are counting on such initiatives to appeal to consumers who consider branded water healthier than tap. Howard Telford, head of soft drinks at Euromonitor, says such efforts will have only a marginal effect on the industry’s carbon footprint. But he says adding extras such as flavorings and fizz may help shore up profits for the likes of Coke, Nestle, and Pepsi.“It points to a future,” Telford says, “where flavor, carbonation, and functional additives—rather than disposable packaging and simple convenience—could be the main value drivers in packaged water.”To contact the authors of this story: Thomas Mulier in Geneva at tmulier@bloomberg.netCorinne Gretler in Zurich at cgretler1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rocks at drocks1@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Bottlers Want to Profit From Your Tap Water

2019-11-01,"Although it's true to that people have to eat, that notion doesn't always make for the most valid investment thesis. Still, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLP), the largest exchange traded fund (ETF) dedicated to that sector, is higher by nearly 21% year-to-date.Traditional consumer staples ETFs like XLP are diverse in the ways of this sector. These funds are not dedicated food ETFs. Rather, they combine exposure to food and beverage stocks, such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) along with consumer products giants like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).Industry-level diversity usually works for investors, but when it comes to food ETFs, the hunt looks a little bit like the one for restaurant ETFs. The need for nourishment and demand for dining would seem to imply that there are plenty of related funds, but the opposite is actually true.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Stocks to Buy in November However, there are few credible, solid ideas for investors to put some grub on the table and in the bank with the following food ETFs. Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (PBJ)Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com Expense ratio: 0.63%The Invesco Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSEARCA:PBJ) is one of the oldest dedicated food and beverage ETFs having debuted over 14 years ago. PBJ also epitomizes the search for food ETFs in that it includes an &quot;and.&quot; That's usually the case as fund issuers figure it's more efficient to mix food and drink together under the umbrella of single ETF.PBJ follows the Dynamic Food & Beverage Intellidex Index, which is a different animal than the benchmarks used by many prosaic consumer staples ETFs. This food ETF's index &quot;is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value,&quot; according to Invesco.While PBJ holds food and beverage basics such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), the fund allocates nearly a quarter of its weight to consumer discretionary stocks, including McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). That gives PBJ the ability, in the right consumer environment, to potentially outperform traditional staples ETFs.Bottom line: this food ETF offers investors a bit more spice than they'll find with the XLP's of the world. First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF (FTXG)Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com Expense ratio: 0.60%The First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF (NASDAQ:FTXG) represents another smart beta approach to food ETFs. This First Trust food ETF, which is just over three years old, follows the Nasdaq US Smart Food & Beverage Index.That index pulls 30 stocks from a broader Nasdaq benchmark and scores those names based on trailing 12-month volatility, value as measured by price-to-cash flow and growth using a combination of three-, six-, nine- and 12-month price appreciation.As far as food ETFs go, FTXG is one of the more pure names out there as it allocates almost 80% of its weight to stocks classified as food product names, according to issuer data.  * 7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right Now For as unique as its weighting methodology is, FTXG's 28-stock roster looks traditional with names such as Pepsi, Kellogg (NYSE:K), General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and Coca-Cola, among others. The Organics ETF (ORG)Source: Shutterstock Expense ratio: 0.35%Often overlooked in the food ETF conversation, the Organics ETF (NASDAQ:ORG), as its name implies, is a play on healthy eating trends. ORG tracks the Solactive Organics Index.&quot;ORG includes global companies that capitalize on the growth in naturally-derived food and personal care items, such as companies that service, produce, distribute, market or sell organic food, beverage, cosmetics, supplements, or packaging,&quot; according to ETF Trends.While over 86% of ORG's weight is allocated to food makers and retailers, giving this fund serious food ETF credibility, there's some concentration risk to consider as its top three holdings combine for nearly a third of the fund's weight.In its favor, ORG is the least expensive of the food ETFs highlighted here.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The big returns come over time, from regular dividend increases, which lift the yield an investor receives on his or her original cost basis.But while these dividend-hiking stalwarts usually aren't known for their hot growth prospects, a few are indeed poised to outperform in 2020.To find price upside among dependable dividend stocks, we started with the Dividend Aristocrats. For the uninitiated, the Aristocrats are an index of 57 S&P; 500 companies currently that have raised their payouts annually for at least 25 years.Next, we calculated the implied upside for all 57 Aristocrats based on analysts' average price targets. A price target is the level at which analysts forecast a stock will trade at some point in the future, typically 12 months out.After running the numbers, we were left with 10 Dividend Aristocrats that offered projected upside of at least 10% in the year ahead.

2019-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It is a bad time to buy into an oil company whose major asset is reserves in the ground that can sustain current production levels of the carbon-laden fossil fuel until near the end of the century. Oil lost its place in the power generation market after the oil shocks of the 1970s, and it is now starting to see serious competition for powering cars, buses and trucks along with the first signs of viable alternatives for fueling maritime transport. Oil’s domination in air transport looks safer for now, and the industry forecasts the strongest growth in petrochemicals that go into everything from plastics and fertilizers to electronic gadgets and clothing. But the tide of history is moving firmly against fossil fuels.Saudi Aramco may boast that it holds the rights to the largest reserves of crude with the lowest carbon footprint to extract, but that rather misses the point. The climate concerns around oil are not about the carbon cost of getting it out of the ground, but of what is done with it afterward.The oil age may not be over — far from it — but oil is facing unprecedented headwinds. Here’s a sample from recent weeks and months:Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said last week that climate change is menacing the historic maritime city, which suffered its second-highest tide on record. Parts of northern England are suffering their worst flooding in decades, and millions were displaced as Cyclone Bulbul hit Bangladesh and northern India.Storms and floods are not new, but they are becoming more severe, more frequent and causing more damage as sea levels rise and the climate changes — developments that are linked, at least in part, to the burning of fossil fuels.Unprecedented bushfires are ravaging parts of eastern Australia rendered tinderbox dry by a two-year drought. Wildfires forced hundreds of thousands of Californians to flee their homes earlier this month. Russia is suffering one of its worst years this century for forest fires. Once again, climate change is contributing to the creation of the hot, dry conditions that have allowed the fires to spread.Climate change is also melting Russia’s permafrost. Not a problem for Saudi Aramco, perhaps, but certainly one for Russia’s oil industry, which relies on infrastructure built in the 1970s on ground that is no longer able to support the weight it was 40 years ago.Mounting climate concerns are inexorably turning public opinion against hydrocarbons, including oil.What’s more, pollution caused by leaking pipelines, accidents involving oil tankers, or drilling rigs are all increasing the pressure on the oil and gas industry.  Particulate emissions from burning fossil fuels are behind elevated mortality rates, leading to stricter controls on ship fuels, measures to push cars and vans out of city centers and increasing pressure on airlines to find alternatives.Aramco has a solution to the predicament the industry is in — petrochemicals. The company wants to turn 40% of its crude into chemicals, according to Abdulaziz Al-Judaimi, Saudi Aramco’s senior vice president for downstream. But petrochemicals are under pressure, too.Globally more than 200 businesses, from Coca-Cola Co. to food and consumer goods giant Unilever NV  have made commitments to reduce plastic waste, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. Unilever aims to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025. Coca-Cola’s goal is for its bottles to contain an average of 50% recycled content by 2030. Initiatives like those will make a serious dent in the projected demand for new plastics.And then there’s an issue that is specific to Saudi Aramco — the security of its facilities. The company did a spectacular job of restoring output levels after a devastating attack on its oil facilities in September, using spare capacity elsewhere to boost flows. But the very fact of the attacks has raised concerns among potential investors about Saudi Arabia’s ability to protect its oil infrastructure.The time to bring private investors into Saudi Aramco was when everybody wanted a piece of the action. Twenty years ago investors would have fallen over each other beating a path to Saudi Aramco’s door. It’s a much tougher sell now.To contact the author of this story: Julian Lee at jlee1627@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Julian Lee is an oil strategist for Bloomberg.

2019-11-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As U.S. political opposition hardens to TikTok, the globally popular video app from Beijing-based ByteDance Inc., some inside the company want to find ways to make the business appear to be less Chinese. That’s a smart move, aimed less at critics in Congress and more at two other East Coast power centers: Madison Avenue and Wall Street.TikTok delivers short, user-generated videos to international audiences. A Chinese version, called Douyin, looks and functions similarly but is focused on domestic users. The company has been reducing the amount of content from China that appears on the broader service, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday. The idea is to give TikTok a more independent, internationally focused business. Talk of a rebrand comes amid a U.S. foreign-investment review and criticism over the user data that TikTok gathers. Prominent U.S. senators have accused the company of censoring content on behalf of the Chinese government and called for a national security review into its 2017 purchase of social-media company Musical.ly. While founded in Shanghai, Musical.ly had an office in California. It was merged into TikTok in 2018, a move that helped it gain more than 100 million app downloads in the U.S.One of the senators, Josh Hawley, tweeted after the WSJ report that TikTok “doesn’t need a rebrand, it needs to sever ties with China.” He’s currently the youngest senator, at 39 around a quarter-century older than Tik Tok’s core demographic. Yet he isn’t the target audience for ByteDance’s efforts.For TikTok to be a true success, it needs to appeal to the likes of Nike, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s. Its advertising business is ready to take off because it has direct access to that all-powerful youth demographic. Yet big corporate names tend to be wary of risking their brands on a new content service. Allegations that TikTok is a tool for Chinese authoritarianism and censorship make it harder for ad execs to sell.Martin Sorrell, founder of the world’s largest advertising firm, WPP Plc, is among those who see big money to be made from TikTok, especially as an opportunity to reach teenagers, he told Bloomberg. Sorrell also believes ByteDance should “probably not” be subject to a review by the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which is chaired by the Commerce Department.With a valuation of $75 billion, ByteDance is the world’s most valuable startup and counts SoftBank Group Corp. and Sequoia Capital among its shareholders, according to CB Insights. For those investors to cash out, ByteDance will need to list on an international bourse — Hong Kong and New York are leading contenders.  ByteDance executives want to build up its international operations before considering an international public offering, Bloomberg wrote last month, after reports it plans an imminent Hong Kong listing. It has hired chiefs for its businesses in the U.S. and India and plans to expand in Australia and Europe. Doing so would help sell the idea that TikTok is not a Chinese content platform.That would simplify making TikTok a separate entity, which ByteDance could then list at a lower and more easily digested market valuation. It could also make it easier to keep the core business — including Douyin and news aggregator Toutiao — close to home, remaining under Beijing’s watchful eye.For such a spinoff to happen, TikTok has to be seen as a viable international company free from censorship and spying. It’s a business case as much as a political one.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Patrick McDowell at pmcdowell10@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2019-11-27,"Twitter stock (NYSE:TWTR) has fallen out of favor. Part of this is the general &quot;bah humbug&quot; vibe that investors are giving to all social media stocks. And part of it stems from the social media company delivering a weak earnings report back in October. Not only did the company miss on earnings, but they lowered their guidance for the fourth quarter.Source: Worawee Meepian / Shutterstock.com Some analysts are suggesting that TWTR stock has now reached the oversold state. But with upward momentum only suggesting a gain of around 9% from current levels, TWTR seems like a short-term trade instead of a long-term investment.That being said, 330 million monthly active users (MAUs) give Twitter an appeal to advertisers. And since that's where Twitter makes their money, it's hard to ignore. Particularly since it is seen by users as being &quot;the least bad&quot; option among social media channels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut if you're thinking about buying low on Twitter stock, here are a couple of things to consider. Active Users Do Not Equate to Brand LoyaltyBrand loyalty is about choosing one brand at the expense of another. For example, there are many people who will choose to drink (and buy) Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) products at the expense of Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) products and vice versa.  * 7 Strong Buy Stocks That Are Bargains Right Now Social media is not like that. Twitter can boast of 330 million MAUs and 134 million daily active users (DAUs). However, the vast majority of those users are not choosing Twitter at the exclusion of other social media outlets.Many users, for example, may use Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to communicate with family and close friends. LinkedIn, which was acquired by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), is for professional use. Twitter lacks the same real or perceived niche. In many cases, users see it as a news outlet, but even there it isn't the only form of social media users are engaging with.A more interesting number would be how many unique eyeballs Twitter captures. I imagine that number would be much smaller. Purchase Intent Does Not Mean an Actual PurchaseBusinesses that market on Twitter have come to rely heavily on influencers. Influencers are individuals who have the ability to affect how users perceive brands or ideas in an online community. A 2016 study by Twitter and Annalect found that Twitter users reported an increase in purchase intent of over five times when they were exposed to promotional content from influencers.I've mentioned my marketing background in the past. Many excited marketing managers have shown me research results in which their brand scored high on &quot;purchase intent.&quot;However sound the methodology is for defining purchase intention, it is, at best, a hypothesis. For example, in a study about cars, marketers may ask you &quot;when do you intend to purchase a car?&quot; I could say I intend to purchase a car in the next 12 months. It doesn't mean I'm going to purchase a car at all.In fairness, Twitter does have a more recent statistic that cites 40% of users have purchased an item after seeing it advertised on Twitter. Twitter Gave Up Its Unique Selling PropositionWhen Twitter first hit the social media scene, its defining characteristic was a 140-character limit. The idea was that users had a short attention span so give them what they want. Many users liked that feature about Twitter (and many users still do adhere to the smaller character limit).However, marketers found it limiting. So, Twitter upped the character count to 280. In doing so, it's become hard to tell the difference between a tweet and a Facebook or Instagram post. The lines have been blurred. Which takes me back to my statement about Twitter and brand loyalty. Users are clearly seeing Twitter as one of many options. And that means they're not unique.Being unique is essential for a channel like Twitter. As I mentioned above, LinkedIn has the benefit of being utilitarian. If nothing else, people are using it to network and look for jobs. Facebook has sheer volume going for it. Twitter has neither.I know there are several marketers that would disagree with me on this point. Many would say that expanding their character limit helped Twitter grow its user base. That's fair. But the argument I made earlier is that the vast majority of Twitter users are not unique to Twitter. Social Media Is the New NormalAs much as it may seem like I'm banging on Twitter, I use Twitter quite frequently. That doesn't mean I see TWTR stock as a good investment. I have a hard time seeing the long-term value in social media stocks in general. The emergence of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) with their Snapchat app, along with TikTok is making a crowded space more crowded.At some point, like the streaming wars, I believe users will have to pick and choose which accounts they stay actively engaged with. And that's why you have to look beyond the numbers before deciding if Twitter stock is a good investment. It's not for me.As of this writing, Chris Markoch did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-13,"People generally assume that a dividend stock has to have a high starting yield to generate lots of income. This is a mistaken assumption. In fact, you often earn more income over the long-run buying a fast-growing company with a low starting dividend yield, than one with a large current yield but minimal growth prospects.Think about capital allocation for a second. When a company has many ways to grow its business internally, it generally shouldn't pay a huge dividend. As shareholders, you get more value from the company opening more stores, factories, and whatnot to grow the business. Frequently, by the time a company starts paying a huge dividend, it is a sign of a corporation getting up there in years; the company no longer has tons of vigor to keep expanding. A mature company can pay large dividends for decades, but it won't have jaw-dropping earnings and dividend upside any more.  * These 7 S&P 500 Stocks Will Deliver a Repeat Performance in the Next Decade Oftentimes, the best way to get a dividend yield is by buying a company as it is just starting to transition from all-out growth toward stable maturity. You get a company that has started to pay a dividend, but still has plenty of opportunities to reinvest in their business and keep earnings moving sharply higher. Let's start looking at these underappreciated dividend growth machines with arguably the decade's most iconic example.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (AAPL)  * Dividend growth since 2009: Dividend payments began in 2012  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 10.2%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $5,605Source: George Dolgikh / Shutterstock.com Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the decade's most impressive dividend stories. Previously, Apple had last paid a dividend way back in 1995. As the company's fortunes faded, it had to suspend its dividend altogether during the lean years. After the turn of the century, the outlook started to improve with the iPod and subsequent new product launches.For years, Apple piled up more profits and cash as iPhone sales exploded. In 2012, the company realized that it was running out of great new growth opportunities, and the company's treasury was overflowing. So, after a 17-year drought, Apple kicked off paying a healthy sum out to shareholders once again.They launched with a $1.51 per year dividend in 2012, and have steadily hiked it since then. Impressively, despite not starting a dividend payout until 2012, if you had invested $10,000 at the end of 2009, you'd have already gotten back $5,605 in dividends on your starting investment. The yield-on-cost -- that is to say your annual yield on your starting investment -- topped 10% as well. Income investors that skipped AAPL stock a decade ago because it didn't pay a dividend ended up missing one of the 2010's best yield plays.

Despite the inopportune timing to go public, Visa stock has been a nearly-instantaneous winner for its investors. Despite that, it didn't initially appear to be much of a dividend-paying stock. Visa paid just 11 cents per share in dividends in 2009; that calculated out to just a 0.5% dividend yield based on Visa's then-$22 stock price.Times have changed though. For one, Visa's stock is up almost 10x over the past decade and now trades around $180. Visa's dividend payments are up by a similar amount, with the annual payout jumping from 11 cents a year to a dollar a year per share.  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade The company's success comes from several factors. For one, it only has one true global competitor, Mastercard (NYSE:MA). Other rivals have failed to achieve the necessary scope to really compete. Also, the purchase of Visa Europe a few years ago was a great move that provided more growth runway than investors had expected. Though disruption may eventually come from newer financial payment technologies, for now, Visa remains an unexpected dividend growth stock superstar. Nike (NKE)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 13.3% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 6.1%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $3,402Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Just over the past year or so, apparel giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) has started to get some attention as a leading dividend growth stock. The company is well-positioned internationally, as it has grown sales in China and other key emerging markets. This has helped Nike post double-digit EPS growth for years and has led to a sharply rising Nike stock price.Long-time Nike stock owners will know that the company has been increasingly generous with its dividends as well. Like numerous stocks on this list, Nike never looked like much of a dividend payer, as its current annual yield is usually around 1%. That's right in line with where it is now; Nike pays 1.02% at the moment.So how has Nike delivered such compelling dividend growth over the past decade? Simple: it compounds. By growing the dividend at more than 13% per year, a starting 1% yield quickly becomes so much more. In fact, if you bought $10,000 of Nike stock a decade ago, you're now getting $610 per year in income. Additionally, you've earned back more than a third of your starting investment in dividends cumulatively. Let Nike be an example of the power of a fast-growing dividend to pile up plenty of wealth in just one decade. Texas Instruments (TXN)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 20.4% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 13.8%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $5,787Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com If you think of superstar tech stocks, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) probably wouldn't be the first name that comes to mind. But the Dallas-based firm has become a mega-successful semiconductor firm in its own right.TXN stock has surged from less than $25 per share in 2009 to $125 now. And it has managed tremendous dividend growth as well, as it has put up a compounded growth rate of more than 20% per year. It has one of the most impressive dividend stories of America's large-cap stocks, in fact. Had you bought $10,000 worth of Texas Instruments at the end of 2009, you'd have already received back nearly $6,000 today. On top of that, you'd be getting $1,380 dollar a year in dividends going forward off your initial $10,000, which makes for a whopping 14% yield on cost.How has Texas Instruments managed this feat? It's due to three separate mechanisms. For one, the company has matured and slowed down growth, instead ratcheting up its dividend payout ratio. It's a classic example of the process I discussed at the top of this article where a company converts from aggressive expansion to a more balanced approach. Where it has grown, it has done so strategically, focusing on long-life semiconductor chips for applications such as sensors and automobiles where there is less competition than in other categories such as cell phones, CPUs, or memory chips.  * 7 Energy Stocks That Are Still Worth Buying In 2020 Finally, Texas Instruments has utilized fantastic capital allocation. The company was quick to take advantage of low interest rates, issuing billions in debt earlier this decade for interest rates of less than 2%. It used this to buy back stock, driving up EPS and allowing it to pay a much larger dividend on its remaining outstanding shares. This combination of smart expansion and crafty financial dealings allowed Texas Instruments to be one of the decade's top growth and income stocks. Estee Lauder (EL)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 19.0% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 7.9%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $4,218Source: Shutterstock Luxury cosmetics company Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) checks a lot of the same boxes as Nike. Like Nike, Estee Lauder has enjoyed unmatched success in China, Hong Kong, and other key Asian markets. Like Nike, EL is benefiting from a huge wave of global prosperity and rising consumer spending in almost every corner of the world. And like Nike, Estee Lauder benefits from international media.Nike has its amazingly effective athlete endorsements to sell product. Meanwhile, Estee Lauder has tapped into Instagram culture to sell more makeup and cosmetics products than ever before.While Nike is more of a household name for many investors, Estee Lauder has managed to top its consumer goods peer in dividend growth. Impressively, Estee Lauder has put up 19%/year dividend growth such that its generally low current dividend yield has exploded into an absolute income machine over the past decade. Shares purchased ten years ago now pay nearly 8% per year, and an initial $10,000 investment has kicked out more than $4,200 in dividends already.And the good times should keep on rolling, as Estee Lauder has numerous tailwinds at its back. The rise of global travel in particular is of great benefit, as Estee Lauder sells a remarkable amount of products in airport shops; turns out people with spending money are eager to buy expensive products during their vacations. And that, in turn, will put even more dividends in Estee Lauder stockowners' pockets in coming years.

There are plenty of iconic American companies in this category, and many of them have paid rising dividends for decades on end. What's less-known, however, is that the smaller, more dynamic food companies often top the bigger ones.A beverage stock like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is widely known and loved. No less a super-investor than Warren Buffett is a huge fan. Yet KO stock delivered a rather ordinary decade of dividends. It grew its dividend at just 7%/year compounded, and offers a yield-on-cost of 6% if you bought in 2009.Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL), the maker of Spam, Skippy peanut butter, Wholly Guacamole, and a wide range of other foods has easily topped staid giants like Coca-Cola. Hormel grew its dividend by nearly 17% per year over the past decade, and investors that bought in 2009 are now getting a 9% annual dividend on their purchase. Impressively, anyone that bought then has now gotten back more than half their starting investment in dividends.  * 7 Exciting Biotech Stocks to Buy Now What's the key to Hormel's success? The company has tons of organic growth; it has more than tripled revenues and earnings this decade. That far eclipses most food and beverage rivals. Also, the company's debt-free balance sheet means it doesn't have to pay interest, freeing up more money for dividends. Broadridge Financial (BR)  * Dividend growth since 2009: 17.3% per year compounded  * Yield-on-cost for Dec. 2009 purchase: 8%  * Dividends received this decade if you invested $10,000 in Dec. 2009: $4,671Source: Shutterstock Broadridge Financial (NYSE:BR) is probably the least-known company on this list. Which goes to show that you can get fantastic dividend growth from smaller and less famous companies.While Broadridge isn't a household name, you've almost certainly used its services. That's because the company dominates proxies, which is how corporations communicate with us shareholders. When you get mail or digital communications about annual meetings, shareholders votes, or any other such matter, Broadridge is usually the service provider. The company provides additional financial services such as operating automatic dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) for shareholders.Maybe not the world's most exciting business, but it is a vital one. Get anything wrong, and investors would be infuriated. So companies and brokerages have little incentive to switch service providers to save a tiny sum of money compared to the potential downside from dissatisfied customers. Meanwhile, the need for these functions continues regardless of how the economy is going; Broadridge's earnings fell less than 5% even during the Great Financial Crisis.The company's indispensable services and strong cash flow have made it a champion dividend payer. It grew dividends more than 17%/year last decade, and is now paying out 8%/year of dividends on an initial 2009 investment. With the company now moving into software for wealth management services, investors should expect Broadridge's latest expansion efforts to lead to even more income growth over the next decade.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned TXN, EL, HRL, and BR shares.

2019-12-16,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Imagine if Toyota Motor Corp. stopped making Corollas, or Coca-Cola Co. stopped making Diet Coke, or McDonald’s Corp. stopped serving Big Macs.That’s the best way of looking at reports that Boeing Co. is considering halting production of its troubled 737 Max single-aisle jet. Making and servicing commercial airplanes accounts for about 80% of Boeing’s operating income, and the 737 series in turn accounts for about 70% of commercial deliveries. A Boeing that’s not making 737s is shutting down close to half its business.The company could disclose a decision as early as Monday on whether to further cut production levels or halt the line altogether, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. Pausing production is increasingly seen as the most viable option, the people were quoted as saying.You might be surprised that Boeing has been making the 737 Max at all since the global fleet was grounded back in March — but an aerospace production line is more like a perpetual motion machine than something you can switch on and off with a click of the fingers.On one hand, there’s the question of what to do with Boeing’s workforce and idled facilities. On the other, there’s its vast network of suppliers, which have been pushed hard in recent years to deliver parts more cheaply and quickly than ever before, and as a result have a particularly thin safety cushion if orders dry up.That’s meant keeping production going has been a better option than stopping the lines altogether, albeit at a reduced rate of 42 a month rather than the 57 a month that were planned for this point. Finished 737s have been stacking up in parking lots like the one outside Boeing’s Renton plant. Right now, there’s in the region of 400 such planes waiting for regulators to give the go-ahead to start flying again, worth about $50 billion at list prices.There’s still vast uncertainty about when the stalemate will end. Federal Aviation Administration head Steve Dickson took the planemaker to task in an unusually public dressing-down Thursday, saying its timetable for bringing the aircraft back into service looked “not realistic” and was “designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.”American Airlines Group Inc. last week took the Max out of its schedules through early April. Flights could stay grounded into May in Europe, where the air safety regulator is carrying out its own checks, Ryanair Holdings Plc said last week. The airline is the 737’s biggest European customer.Put that way, it starts to become clearer why at some point Boeing has to pull the plug. It costs the company hard cash to make each plane, but it’s not collecting anything from customers until regulators give the say-so to resume deliveries. Operating cash flow in the third quarter hit minus $2.42 billion, the worst result on that measure in a generation and below the weakest performance during the 2008 financial crisis.“At some point you decide you can’t keep pouring money into building airplanes,” said Scott Hamilton, managing director of aerospace consultancy Leeham Co. “Even Boeing with all its financial resources, at some point just has to stop the bleeding.”Even halting production won’t mean the end of the 737 Max. Airlines don’t want to find Airbus SE turning into a monopoly supplier of single-aisle jets in the mold of the 737 and A320. Such planes are the workhorses of medium-haul, lower-cost routes where they make most of their money. As a result, carriers want the Max to succeed as much as Boeing does.In theory, Boeing could try to make up numbers with the previous 737 NG models while going back to the drawing board with the Max, but production of that plane has already stopped and it can’t compete economically with the A320neo now streaming off Airbus production lines. As a result, Boeing and the aviation industry as a whole have no option but to keep pushing forward.That doesn’t mean the road ahead will be easy. The longer the delays go on, the more Boeing loses the trust of passengers and by extension its customers, the airlines. That will eventually show up in a harder bargain driven over future aircraft orders, while suppliers that have helped to fatten Boeing’s margins at the expense of their own in recent years may find an opportunity to fight back.Valuation of aerospace companies tends to be very long term, and Boeing is still priced well above Airbus on most metrics. Should the current turbulence persist, don’t be surprised to see that premium start to stall. To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-12-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In 2006, I interviewed Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, about reduced-harm tobacco products. The idea that people might one day be able to get a nicotine fix without ingesting all the carcinogens derived from burning tobacco was still new. Tobacco companies were pouring millions into research labs trying to make such products a reality, but the only thing on the market was snus, the pouch tobacco product made by Swedish Match AB. Electronic cigarettes, first developed in China in 2003, hadn’t yet migrated to the U.S.Myers co-founded his organization in 1996. (Disclosure: It has long been supported financially by Bloomberg Philanthropies.) Ever since, he’s been one of the two or three most important people in the tobacco-control community, someone whose opinion matters a great deal. That’s why I wanted to learn his view about the prospect that it might soon be possible to consume addictive nicotine without dying of cigarette smoke. He was wholeheartedly in favor.“The challenge to me is not to eliminate smoking, but the death and disease of smoking,” Myers responded.If you had a product that addicted 45 million people and killed none of them, I would take that deal. Then you’d have coffee! I have to believe that if the marketplace incentives were such that over time someone could devise a product that would give the same satisfaction as tobacco but didn’t kill them, people would flock to it.Thirteen years have passed since that interview, and reduced-harm tobacco products, which addict but don’t kill, are plentiful. Juul makes one, and dozens of other companies such as Halo, Blu and Green Smoke manufacture and market e-cigarettes. People have indeed flocked to them, just as Myers predicted. But even before the current so-called youth-vaping crisis, Myers had changed his mind. No longer was he willing to equate nicotine to coffee. Now nicotine was an imminent danger to the nation’s youth, “a highly addictive chemical compound” that could “affect adolescent brain development.”(1)Big bad tobacco was using flavors and devious marketing to hook a new generation of addicts. Regular readers know that I strongly believe that vaping can save lives. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 1.1 billion smokers worldwide. Just imagine what might happen if there was a global campaign to move those smokers to e-cigarettes. They may not be perfectly safe, but they are much safer than cigarettes — that’s what harm reduction is. Think about the hundreds of millions of people who would escape an early, painful death from a tobacco-related disease if they switched to vaping. Wouldn’t that be amazing?Yet the public health community doesn’t view saving the lives of smokers as a priority anymore. That’s because, in its view, protecting kids from nicotine matters more. That’s Myers’s position, and it’s also the position of the American Medical Association, which wants a complete ban on all vaping product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (the approval process hasn’t even begun yet for e-cigarettes). The same goes for the W.H.O., which is vehemently anti-vaping, and the American Lung Association. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb has called for a ban on “pod-based e-cigarettes,” which would put Juul out of business.On the other hand, important voices who believe e-cigarettes can save lives are finally pushing back. In its latest issue, Science magazine published an important essay by five public health heavyweights, three of whom are deans at university public health schools.(2)One of the two non-deans, David Abrams, was a prominent figure in the anti-tobacco movement until he embraced vaping and was essentially booted out.(3)Their message is simple: It’s time to start putting the lives of adult smokers over the fears that kids will become addicted to coffee, er, I mean nicotine. They don’t put it quite like that, of course. Nobody does. Who wants to face the opprobrium of the anti-tobacco hardliners by pointing out that the worry over youth vaping is wildly overblown? “We share strong concern about the large increase in youth vaping,” the authors write, “and we promote harm minimization and management.” But then they add a sentence you rarely hear in the U.S.: “Careful analysis of all the data in context indicates that the net benefits of vaped nicotine products outweigh the feared harms to youth.” How can this be, given all the anti-vaping rhetoric? Here are a few reasons they list:The rise in youth vaping has been matched by a substantial decline in youth smoking, meaning that a significant number of teenage vapers are kids who would otherwise become addicted to cigarettes. Kids may like flavors, but so do adult smokers — and the appeal of flavors is a reason they stop smoking and start vaping. The majority of vaping teens are not daily users but are experimenting, just as millions of teens used to do with cigarettes. And so far, there is zero proof that vaping is a gateway to smoking.One important reason not mentioned in the essay — but which I spoke to Abrams about — is that nicotine, though addictive, simply isn’t that harmful. Consider the shibboleth about nicotine harming teenage brains. It is certainly true, as Abrams puts it, that “if you overload adolescent rats, you see a problem.” But the idea that today’s kids are “guinea pigs for the effects of nicotine on the brain”— a phrase used by Frances Leslie, a scientist at the University of California at Irvine — is silly. As much as 40% of the Greatest Generation smoked liked chimneys when they were teens and pre-teens without discernible brain damage. Why are public health officials only now contending that nicotine affects kids’ brains? If you’re a parent of a teenager, you never want your kid to be addicted to anything, whether it’s Coca-Cola, pornography, nail-biting — or vaping. But if your kids are likely to experiment with addictive substances, which would you prefer they try: cigarettes or e-cigarettes? It’s not even close.Having dispensed with the supposed harms of youth vaping, the authors of the Science essay then take a close look at the benefits to adult smokers. Here is their starting point: “In the case of adult smokers, there is solid scientific evidence that vaping nicotine is much safer than smoking.” They add: Although it may be decades before we fully understand the long-term consequences of vaping nicotine without smoke, many argue that we know enough and stress that too many smokers die every day we delay taking reasonable and rational action based on the science to date.As for how many smokers might benefit from vaping, the authors estimate that if most smokers switched to vaping over the next 10 years, “1.6 million premature deaths would be avoided … in the United States alone.” Worldwide, a billion lives could be saved by the end of the century. Saving those lives was once the goal of public health. It should be again.Yet the impulse of governments and public health organizations in the U.S. is prohibitionist. Ban flavors. Ban some vaping devices. Ban all vaping devices. Anti-vaping scientists like Stanton Glantz at the University of California at San Francisco feed the prohibitionist impulses by churning out studies that claim to show that vaping is as harmful as smoking — work that’s less science than propaganda. This isn’t sound public policy. It’s mass hysteria.Finally, the authors point out that the issue of youth smoking can largely be solved by sound regulation. Raise the vaping (and smoking) age to 21. Create a “regulatory infrastructure” to make sure the products are safe (which would also reduce the chances of another outbreak of lung disease caused by THC bought on the black market). Tax vaping products to make them more expensive for teens but set the tax low enough to create incentives for adult smokers to switch from highly taxed cigarettes.The authors note that the U.K., which champions harm reduction, “has been able to accomplish appropriate regulation that has managed both youth nicotine uptake and helping adult smokers to quit.” Is it really the case that the U.K. has the skill to regulate vaping but the U.S. doesn’t?I believe that we will one day look back on this era and wonder what we were thinking. Given the chance to save hundreds of millions of lives, we chose instead to focus on teenagers ingesting a relatively harmless substance that might actually have kept them from smoking deadly cigarettes.Matt Myers had it right in 2006. We should be taking the deal that is being offered to us: nicotine fix without death. My hope is that the essay in Science might finally begin to reestablish this common-sense approach. My fear is that it won’t.(1) These quotes come from a column Myers co-wrote with former FDA commissioner David Kessler for the New York Times in April 2015.(2) They are: Amy Fairchild, dean of the College of Public Health at Ohio State University; Cheryl Healton, dean at New York University’s College of Global Public Health; James Curran, dean of the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University; David Abrams, a public health professor at NYU; and Ronald Bayer, a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.(3) Until 2017, Abrams was a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

2019-12-22,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Growing up in the U.K. in the 1980s, the Christmas season was associated with particular foods and drinks. Pies made from fruit “mincemeat”; the same dried fruits cooked into Christmas pudding; grandparents passing round glasses of sherry.Believe it or not, that nostalgic memory hints at a long-term risk to the most bullish corner of the global liquor market: China’s sorghum-based firewater, baijiu.The past few years have seen extraordinary growth for baijiu makers. Kweichow Moutai Co., the maker of the most prestigious brand, overtook Diageo Plc to become the world’s biggest distiller by market capitalization in 2017. Now it’s in a whole other league, overtaking even Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and PepsiCo Inc. on that measure and within spitting distance of taking Coca-Cola Co.’s crown as the world’s largest beverage company.What’s more, this success has been built on the back not of a valuation bubble, but of relatively pedestrian assumptions about earnings. Kweichow Moutai is on a lower price-earnings multiple than Brown-Forman Corp., Davide Campari-Milano SpA and Remy Cointreau SA. Luzhou Laojiao Co. is cheaper on that measure than any major western distiller.What could possibly put a cloud on the horizon of this thriving market? The most serious looming risk is embodied in those nostalgic memories of a British Christmas: demographics.Throughout baijiu’s boom, it’s struggled to shake the perception that it’s primarily a drink for older men. Its former image as an unofficial currency of corrupt government officials has receded since a campaign against official graft in the early years of President Xi Jinping’s reign. Still, the connotations of rich older men exchanging drunken toasts remain, even if the drinkers in the stereotype are now more likely to be employed in the private than the public sector.“Many young people still think that baijiu isn't for them, that no matter the flavor, it's not a drink for the young,” according to a China Daily article this year. “Drinking baijiu is increasingly seen as a dated behavior by younger Chinese uninterested in banquets and bravado,” wrote Jing Daily, a site specializing in the Chinese luxury market.That association with oldsters is a problem Spain’s sherry industry has been enduring for several decades. In the 1970s and 1980s, exports to the U.K., the Netherlands and the U.S. boomed in an unprecedented manner, to the point that bodega conglomerate Rumasa was reported to account for as much as 2% of Spanish GDP.Since then it’s been in long-term decline. Sherry’s core consumers outside Spain have reached a more abstemious age or died out, while younger drinkers shun a product they associate with their grandparents. For all that many wine connoisseurs sing its praises and lament sherry’s fall from grace, it’s hard to see the glory days returning.This trajectory is a common one in the alcohol business, which lives and dies on the changing demographics of its consumers. One reason Japan’s brewers have been so desperate to acquire overseas businesses while Vietnamese ones have been M&A targets is that beer is drunk by thirsty workers, and Japan’s labor force is declining while Vietnam’s is rising. The same goes for clear spirits like baijiu. Its success is hard to separate from the fact that China’s population of men aged 40 to 60 increased by more than half over the past two decades, adding about 78 million people to the core baijiu-drinking market. That demographic is set to stagnate over the coming decade, though, before beginning an accelerating decline after 2030.To the extent that the industry is making any inroads with women and younger people, it’s in lower-cost, lighter-flavored “rice aroma” products where margins are tighter. The giant listed baijiu-makers specialize in the complex, higher-cost “sauce aroma” and “strong aroma” varieties such as Maotai and Luzhou Laojiao, which is quite a different product.This needn’t be the end of the world. The drinks market’s best defense against unfavorable demographics is “premiumization” — counting not on a larger number of consumers, but a small group paying more and more. Premiumization is already the strategy of the high-end listed baijiu companies, so there's no reason they can’t keep going with it.Still, chasing the luxury market is notoriously expensive in marketing terms, and baijiu makers for years have been able to rely on a product that sells itself.Major distillers typically dedicate a third or more of their revenue to selling, general and administrative costs — mostly marketing and distribution. Baijiu makers are far more thrifty, one reason their profit margins are so much fatter than those of peers. As their core demographic ages out of its drinking habit, though, they’re likely to have to spend more and more converting younger drinkers.Every cellar manager knows that liquors can get better with age, but the process of maturation has to be carefully monitored and cultivated if the precious drink isn’t to turn into drain-cleaner. Marketing departments of baijiu companies will have to be no less careful over the coming decades maintaining the shine on their storied brands. To contact the author of this story: David Fickling at dfickling@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

2019-12-23,"Editor's Note: U.S. markets close at 1 p.m. ET on Christmas Eve and are closed all day on Wednesday for Christmas. We will not be sending out new a new Trade of the Day on Tuesday or Wednesday. Look for the next Trade of the Day in your inbox on Thursday, Dec. 26.Two weeks ago, we recommended you sell a put write on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). We were excited about the strong jobs numbers from November and the impact they might have on consumer spending and economic growth in the United States.We're still excited about all those things, but we're also excited about the first phase of the trade deal the U.S. has reached with China. Seeing Dec. 15 come and go with no new tariffs being implemented put everyone on Wall Street in a buying mood.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe S&P 500 closed above 3,200 for the first time last week, and the bullishness played out particularly well in our trade on BAC. The stock shot higher on Thursday, Dec. 12, after the trade deal was announced, and it hovered around $35 last week. We bought back our old put, and now we're selling a new one. It's Still All About Interest RatesRight now, banks are able to borrow money at incredibly cheap rates because the Federal Reserve has cut short-term rates so low. And now that longer-term rates are rising, banks are able to charge more for the money they lend.The difference between what the bank pays to borrow money and what the bank charges to lend money is its net interest margin. Traders seem to be banking on BAC enjoying higher net interest margins heading into 2020.When we mentioned this in our last BAC recommendation, the CBOE 10-Year Treasury Yield Index (INDEXCBOE:TNX) was at around 1.85%, but as you can see in the chart below, the TNX has been heading higher.Daily Chart of CBOE 10-Year Treasury Yield Index (TNX) -- Chart Source: TradingViewSpecifically, the TNX has been making higher lows since it found a bottom in September. The TNX doesn't technically track interest rates, but it does have a direct relationship with long-term rates, which is why we use it to measure whether or not interest rates are heading higher.According to its projection materials, the Fed doesn't plan on raising rates in 2020, which means overnight borrowing for banks will still be cheap. As long-term rates continue to climb, banks -- including BAC -- will continue to earn more money. Hovering Around $35As mentioned above, BAC hovered around the $35 level last week. It pushed above $35 per share several times, but it couldn't sustain its momentum.Daily Chart of Bank of America (BAC) -- Chart Source: TradingViewIf you look at the chart above, you can see that BAC was consolidating briefly before its trade-related breakout. The top of that range was around $33.50, which means it could act as support if BAC drops down. That potential support level would also make a great strike price for short options.But when picking an expiration, remember that the banks always kick off earnings season. BAC will report earnings on Jan. 15, so be sure to pick an expiration before then. Even a good earnings report can lead to selling. Investors want to take their profits and move into new positions, and that can push a stock lower.Stick with weekly expirations in early January to avoid any earnings-related complications.InvestorPlace advisers John Jagerson and S. Wade Hansen, both Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designees, are co-founders of LearningMarkets.com, as well as the co-editors of Strategic Trader.The post Banking on Pre-Earnings Strength in BAC appeared first on InvestorPlace.",Banking on Pre-Earnings Strength in BAC
2019-12-23,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- He’s making a list and checking it twice, but can’t find a takeover target that’s nice.Warren Buffett is the jolly man of the stock market. However, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has also been a bit of a Scrooge this year, as he continues to pass up acquisitions and instead hoard his money. The billionaire has long been seeking a really big deal on which to spend some of his company’s $128 billion of cash, except everything is overpriced in his view. To make matters more frustrating, Berkshire’s own shares are lagging behind the broader U.S. market by the most since 2009.While 2019 wasn’t Buffett’s worst year, it was surely one of his dullest. With Berkshire’s cash pile reaching new heights, Buffett has said that just the thought of taking over another company — he’s acquired nearly 200 during his career — causes his heart “to beat faster.” Instead, this chart of Berkshire’s stock performance looks like it’s almost flat-lining:Berkshire shares are on track to end the year up a modest 11%, trailing the S&P 500 index by 20 percentage points. That’s even as the company posted record operating profit in the latest quarter.Buffett, who turned 89 in August, is the fourth-richest person in the world, and it’s hard for the fourth-richest person in the world to have too bad of a year. But for one of the most celebrated investors and dealmakers of all time, who also enjoys basking in the spotlight, the deal dry spell isn’t much fun. Without any new acquisitions to rave about, even Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letters — the release of which investors treat like tickets dropping for a Beyonce concert — lately have been shorter than usual and have lacked his characteristic bawdy metaphors. (That’s not to say a retreat from the dirty-grandpa humor isn’t welcomed by this writer.)Berkshire’s last large takeover — the kind he dubs “elephants” — was Precision Castparts, an aerospace-parts supplier, for $37 billion; it was completed nearly four years ago. This year, Berkshire merely provided $10 billion of high-interest financing to help another company, Occidental Petroleum Corp., make an acquisition; that barely put a dent in Berkshire’s cash. It was then outbid in November for software distributor Tech Data Corp. in what would have been a $5 billion deal.(1) Berkshire had considered selling debt in Europe, which might have been a precursor to a significant acquisition overseas, but that never panned out. At the end of the day, the company’s splashiest investment of the year was an $861 million stake in Amazon.com Inc. The closest thing Buffett found to an elephant might just be this stuffed animal, an item sold at RH, a small home-furnishings retailer in which Berkshire recently bought a stake.Though it was a boring year, 2019 marks the end of what was perhaps Berkshire’s most transformative decade. It became the owner of one of America’s most expansive railroad systems, BNSF, while recognizable brands including Duracell and Kraft Heinz (for better or worse) also joined the Berkshire family. At the start of the decade, consumer stocks such as Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. accounted for the biggest share of Berkshire’s stock-market holdings. Now, Apple Inc. and some banks and credit-card companies together comprise almost three-quarters of its portfolio. Buffett also took meaningful steps toward succession planning by promoting Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to oversee all Berkshire’s operations and thus raising their public profiles. Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger — who turns 96 on New Year’s Day — were asked during the last shareholder meeting in May whether their successors will have to transition the company from an acquisition-and-investment vehicle into an entity focused instead on returning capital through stock buybacks and dividends. “That’s certainly a possibility,” maybe even during his time, Buffett said. “But we will have to see how that works out over many years, because certain years huge opportunities present themselves and other years are totally dry holes.” Berkshire spent about $2.8 billion repurchasing class A and B shares in the first nine months of 2019, up from $0 in 2017.U.S. stocks haven’t been getting any cheaper for Buffett. That said, some see his hoarding of cash partly as an insurance policy in case his health deteriorates, so that there’s added financial flexibility for the next CEO. But knowing Buffett, he’ll want to go out with a bang. Finding one last elephant should be his New Year’s resolution. (1) Buffett was also close to doing a “very large” transaction around this time last year, but it fell apart, as did attempted deals involving Unilever Plc and Oncor Electric Delivery Co. in 2017.To contact the author of this story: Tara Lachapelle at tlachapelle@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2019-12-23,"Without knowing hardly anything about New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV), you already know that it's an extremely risky trade. With 2019 coming to a close shortly, NBEV stock is down an alarming 59%.Source: Shutterstock Since February - and with a brief respite in the spring season - shares have consistently declined. As our own Laura Hoy described, it's a classic falling knife.Despite the ugliness in New Age Beverages stock, though, the underlying company undeniably carries speculative appeal. First, NBEV offers multiple beverage brands, with many focusing on the health aspect. And that's a huge positive considering the current trends in the beverage marketplace. After all, consumers not only want health drinks but they're willing to pay the premium.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFurthermore, NBEV stock is levered to the cannabidiol or CBD business via the organization's Marley brand. Thanks to the groundbreaking Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (also known as the farm bill), hemp and hemp-derivatives like CBD are federally legal, so long as they don't contain more than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content.  * 7 Vaping Stocks to Get into Ahead of the Crowd That passing of the farm bill opened the floodgates to a whole new industry. On paper, this bodes well for New Age Beverages stock, considering its desirable Marley brand. However, as you can see from the share price, things haven't panned out as planned. For NBEV Stock, the Problems Are RealNo matter how enticing the narrative sounds, at some point, cannabis-related companies must deliver the goods. Failing that, they've got to demonstrate a reasonable pathway to sustainable growth and profitability to keep stakeholders interested.For New Age Beverages stock, this a problem on both fronts. Again, on paper, the revenue growth appears very impressive. However, as InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin points out, this year's top-line sales growth &quot;all came through acquisitions, as detailed in an SEC filing. Morinda, purchased a year ago, contributed $54.8 million in sales. Brands Within Reach, picked up in June, added $2.4 million of revenue.&quot;Minus the buyouts, revenue growth does not look impressive; indeed, quite the opposite. Martin further notes that:The legacy New Age business posted sales of $12.6 million, about 5% below last year's total. And its revenue should not be shrinking. New deals with the likes of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and 7-Eleven (OTCMKTS:SVNDY) were supposed to drive higher sales.If these were the only headwinds against NBEV stock, it'd be bad enough. However, Hoy asserts that management created unnecessary roadblocks for themselves. She wrote:…management has poorly executed its strategy in North America. Until now, the firm only had a &quot;sales team of 2 or 3&quot; in North America-- a questionable way to manage a segment that the firm itself said was expanding rapidly as the company makes inroads into several different businesses.Unsurprisingly, then, the profitability picture for NBEV stock currently looks poor. Losses are widening while long-term debt has expanded. And its products don't appear to be gaining traction as you might expect. But the Opportunities Are Real TooSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto Despite the mismanagement and misfires, New Age still has the Marley brand. While it's not wise to bank on any one asset, investors may not appreciate how powerful this brand is.In the U.S., experts forecast that the value of the CBD-infused beverages market will hit $227 million. By the end of next year, it should reach $472 million. And by 2023, this segment will make significant noise as a $1.4 billion market.Granted, this is pennies compared to the global beverages' arena. However, New Age doesn't need to take over the world. Given their small fiscal footprint relative to the beverage giants, NBEV just needs to make an impact in the North American sector.That's a much more reasonable objective, which does bode well for New Age Beverages stock. As I said, the underlying company has the Marley brand, and from what I'm seeing in the beverage space, branding is everything.As several analysts have noted, consumers (particularly Millennials) have gravitated toward health-related drinks. But I can make the case that consumers are actually gravitating toward the perception of health.Case in point is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). In recent quarters, the soft drink behemoth has strung together impressive earnings results. As I mentioned last year, one of Coca-Cola's most conspicuous rebranding efforts involved packaging their Diet Coke drinks in tall, lithe cans brimming with bright colors.We know this crap isn't healthy. Furthermore, Coca-Cola represents big business, hardly a Millennial attribute. Yet the power of this new Diet Coke brand rejuvenated a company that had no business of being rejuvenated.Imagine what would happen if NBEV management got their act together? The Marley brand could skyrocket NBEV stock. An Ultra-Speculative Bet, but with a ShotPlease don't mistake the investment profile of New Age Beverages stock: this is a risky gamble. Even if you were confidently bullish, it's not something you play with other than with &quot;dumb money.&quot;That said, among stupid bets, NBEV stock has a believable catalyst. It just needs to survive some ugly challenges, which of course is no guarantee.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-26,"It may or may not be the remnants of a Christmas miracle or a Santa Claus rally, but stocks rallied again Thursday with leadership from technology as the Nasdaq Composite extends its winning streak to 11 days with several of the marquee tech names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing higher.Source: Courtesy of Finviz  * The S&P 500 added 0.51%  * The Dow Jones advanced 0.37%  * The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.78%  * In the not-all-that-surprising category, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was easily the best-performing member of the Dow, soaring 1.98%.Although it's a Dow component, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bears mentioning today because the e-commerce juggernaut said it shattered records for the 2019 holiday season. That's confirmation of the strength of the U.S., a familiar theme and a major source of economic and equity market sturdiness in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsFor near-term traders, it's worth noting that the last five trading days of the year, a period we're in right now, tend to be favorable for stocks. That said, there are some near-term hurdles, including tomorrow's oil inventories report.In advance of that report Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) were in the green today, perhaps a sign traders are banking on a decline in oil supplies for the week ending Dec. 20.  * 10 Best Stocks to Beat the Market in 2020 Overall, it was a decent day for the Dow with 19 of 30 members of the blue-chip index pointed higher late in Thursday's session. In Awe of AppleAs noted above, Apple was the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones today, extending its winning streak to three days. More impressive than that streak is that this is a $1.26 trillion company that has soared more than 80% this year. For the math nerds out there, that means Apple has added more than $530 billion in market value just this year.Buoyed by holiday demand for the AirPods and iPhone, Apple is capping its best year of equity performance in a decade and with the major 5G rollout coming in 2020, another big year could be on the horizon.&quot;The average price target for Apple shares stands at about $268, which implies downside of about 7% from where it has been trading,&quot; reports Bloomberg. &quot;Despite that, Wall Street remains broadly positive on Apple, with 28 firms recommending investors buy the stock. To compare, 14 firms have neutral ratings, while seven advocate selling.&quot; Redemption StoryThis is the time of year when some investors start examining the dogs of the Dow to unearth redemption stories for the new year. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) definitely merits a place in that conversation. The stock has been a laggard, as have many healthcare names, this year, but has the potential to reward investors in 2020.Next year could be a pivotal one for Pfizer investors because the company faces a major patent dropoff in 2026. Between 2020 and 2026, new product launches and sales increases are integral to bolster the long-term case for the stock.&quot;Pfizer says it can grow sales by 6% a year over the next five years. Key tests for the company come in 2020, when investors expect data on a promising new indication for the company's cancer drug Ibrance, among others,&quot; reports Barron's. More Holiday CheerUnderscoring the point about consumer spending this holiday season, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Visa (NYSE:V) were among the Dow's better performers today not named Apple. Banks are benefiting from the buoyant economy and strong consumer data. Those themes matriculate over to Visa, too, as more credit and debit card swipes are good news for that stock.With the Federal Reserve likely to hold off on interest rate cuts for several more months and with market participants looking for value plays, bank stocks like JPM could extend upside into the early part of 2020. Saying no to CannabisShares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) closed modestly higher after the company said it doesn't have plans to get into the cannabis market. Speculation to that effect when a YouTube user posted a video of a Coke can with a childproof lid, saying it was a prototype for a cannabis-infused product the company is working.The posted of the since deleted video said his father works for Coca-Cola, prompting the company to say it's not eyeing the cannabis market. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayAt this point, it's certainly becoming riskier to bet against stock, particularly with headline risk diminishing.&quot;Investors have been adding more risk after the U.S. and China announced they have reached a phase one trade agreement earlier this month. The two countries are in the process of translating the deal, aiming to sign it in early January,&quot; according to CNBC.Not to rain on anyone's parade, but there could be some risk heading in January with Apple reporting earnings and the same being true for a slew of consumer discretionary companies. That will bring updates on just how good holiday shopping was. Remember, current data isn't factoring in returns.

2019-12-31,"Uncertainty heading into a presidential election cycle, a continued trade war with China (it's only a &quot;Phase One&quot; agreement, after all) and potentially sluggish U.S. economic growth has many Wall Street analysts recommending investors rotate into defensive stocks. And unsurprisingly, consumer staples stocks are getting the nod heading into 2020.It makes sense. Consumer staples stocks - which provide things that people need on a near-daily basis, from food to toiletries - make excellent investments in virtually every economic environment, but they're especially attractive during economic slowdowns. That's because people simply can't cut back on consumer staples like they can other products. As a result, the sector has historically outperformed the broader market during downturns.&quot;We expect the market to vacillate between a pro-cyclical outcome and a defensive one as data comes in and trade tensions and the election evolve,&quot; Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients in early December. &quot;We slightly favor the more defensive outcome given our well below the consensus forecast for S&P; 500 earnings growth next year.&quot;Admittedly, if we get another bull run like we did in 2019, consumer staples might lag a bit. While their 2019 total return (price plus dividends) through Dec. 30 of 27.3% is far better than their 12-year average annual return of 10.4%, it still was about three percentage points behind the S&P; 500&#92;.

Unemployment remained at 3.5%.Source: Charts Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 lost 0.29%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched lower by 0.46%  * The Nasdaq Composite retreated by 0.27%  * On a day that should have favored defensive fare, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) paced the Dow with a gain of 1.41%In addition to the jobs number missing estimates and the already low jobless rate holding steady, wages rose just 2.9% last month, below the 3.1% economists expected. In better news, the broader unemployment rate, the one that includes discouraged workers and the underemployed, fell to 6.7%.The October and November numbers were revised slightly lower, adding to the headwinds for riskier assets today. All that taken into account, declines for the major averages to close the week were palatable, though just nine of the Dow's 30 members were in the green in late trading.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Pfizer the FantasticAmong the five largest domestic pharmaceuticals stocks, Pfizer was the biggest dog in 2019, but every dog has its day, eventually.

Bad News DuoIn late trading, Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) were tussling for the dubious distinction of being the Dow's worst-performing name today. In the case of Travelers, the Friday malaise is easy to explain as the stock was downgraded by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods to &quot;underperform&quot; from &quot;market weight.&quot; The research also lowered its price target on Travelers to $125 from $144. That new target is below the $135 area at which the stock closed today.Predictably, Boeing's woes today are a bit more complex. Suffice to say company documents revealing that employees described the controversial 737 MAX jet as &quot;designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys&quot; and that the now grounded passenger plane was subject to &quot;piss poor design&quot; didn't help Boeing stock today.Those communications are dated April 2017, but despite the age, those comments call into question Boeing's ability to get the 737 MAX back in the skies.&quot;We regret the content of these communications, and apologize to the [Federal Aviation Administration], Congress, our airline customers, and to the flying public for them,&quot; the company said. Defensive DueAs noted above, today was the type of day when investors favored defensive names, providing some follow through on Thursday's gains by Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bangkok’s billionaires don’t usually have to contend with much resistance as they expand. Tesco Plc’s sale of its Southeast Asian supermarkets may be about to change that.The $32 billion British retailer said in December it was considering selling the group’s stores in Thailand and Malaysia, becoming the latest international grocery giant to bow out of Asia. First-round bids for the asset, estimated to be worth between $7 billion and $9 billion, are due this week. Suitors are likely to be drawn from local conglomerates, among them: Dhanin Chearavanont’s CP Group; Central Group, controlled by the Chirathivat family; and beer-and-spirits magnate Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi's TCC Group.So far, so normal for tycoon-heavy Thailand. Perhaps not. Last month, the Office of Trade Competition Commission, or OTCC, threw a wrench in the gears, signaling before offers even materialized that it would review the deal and could rule against any combination that grabbed too much of the market.Thailand’s government has revamped the antitrust authority since 2017, turning it from a dormant and toothless appendage of the Ministry of Commerce into an impartial agency with an independent workforce. Taking a tough stance could burnish the pro-military administration’s consumer-protection credentials, as it battles a slowing economy and the country’s worst drought in decades.Added to that, this is the the first high-profile, consumer-facing case that the new-look OTCC has handled. It’s also, potentially, one of the largest-ever acquisitions by a Thai group, and among the largest deals in Asia this year. That all but sets up a tussle with some of the most powerful patriarchs in Thai business.In theory, problems arise when a company has a market share of 50% or more. The trouble here, as in every antitrust debate, is deciding what counts as a market.Tesco, under the Tesco Lotus brand, is already Thailand’s biggest supermarket chain with almost 2,000 stores, plus 74 in Malaysia. So, do convenience stores, like CP’s 7-Eleven outlets, count as part of the same market? By the broadest definition, CP touches the vast majority of Thailand’s food chain. What about duty-free, should a last-minute bid come from King Power Group, run by the billionaire Srivaddhanaprabha family that owns Leicester City Football Club? Central Group, meanwhile, has 200 supermarkets, and TCC owns Big C hypermarkets.All of that suggests plenty of wrangling ahead. Worse, Thailand now has a two-stage reporting structure: Unusually by global standards, would-be merger partners may have to report both ahead of and on completion of any deal that creates a dominant player. That means passing the first hurdle doesn’t guarantee a bidder will clear the second.In the end, asset sales may be the most palatable solution, should a big retailer win the contest. Antitrust bosses, still early in their tenure, may be reluctant to irk too many big names. Chinese regulators ruffled plenty of feathers when the Beijing-based Ministry of Commerce vetoed Coca-Cola Co.’s acquisition of a Chinese juice maker in 2009. And Thailand, with its unimpressive economy, badly needs investment.Still, supermarkets are a sensitive and unpredictable area for antitrust authorities, with their focus on safeguarding consumers. Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority, after all, last year stopped J Sainsbury Plc from buying Walmart Inc.’s Asda to create the country’s largest supermarket chain. This could turn into quite a food fight. To contact the author of this story: Clara Ferreira Marques at cferreirama@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Clara Ferreira Marques is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities and environmental, social and governance issues.

2020-01-15,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Profits aren’t the be-all and end-all of business, according to the chief executives of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Coca-Cola Company, General Motors Co. and other members of the Business Roundtable group of American bosses.Their statement last year disavowing the primacy of shareholders and emphasizing that businesses should be run for the benefit of all stakeholders — including customers, employees, communities and suppliers —  left at least one big question unanswered: If the purpose of business is more than just creating value for shareholders, don’t executives need to be incentivized to do more than just increase profit and the share price?So-called “environmental, social and governance” issues — known by the acronym ESG — have become a prime concern for investors who manage trillions of dollars of capital. “Over time, companies and countries that do not respond to stakeholders and address sustainability risks will encounter growing skepticism from the markets, and in turn, a higher cost of capital,” BlackRock Inc.’s boss Larry Fink wrote in his annual letter to CEOs this week.Perhaps it’s time, then, that these topics are given greater emphasis in executive compensation plans. If you think that sounds borderline Marxist, I’ll remind you that Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum — a mountainside schmooze-fest for the 1% that takes place next week — has proposed something very similar.Two recent examples — one from each side of the Atlantic — illustrate why executive pay is ripe for reform.In the U.K. the former boss of homebuilder Persimmon Plc was awarded 85 million pounds ($110 million) for two years work, mainly because generous government home-purchase subsidies helped inflate his company’s sales, dividends and stock price. A damning independent review subsequently exposed the company’s shoddy construction practices.(2)Meanwhile, Boeing Co. executives were richly rewarded for increasing earnings, cash flow and the share price, but that appears to have come at the cost of a rotten corporate culture that browbeat regulators, squeezed suppliers, devalued engineering and hurried an unsafe aircraft into production without adequate pilot training.Plenty of companies already set non-financial strategic targets to align executive compensation with important corporate initiatives and customer satisfaction. Some airline bosses get paid less if planes are consistently late or too much baggage goes missing, for example. In the mining and oil industries it’s common to cut rewards if there are fatal accidents or serious injuries.Elsewhere, though, it’s pretty rare for executives to be offered incentives to achieve ESG targets, such as cutting carbon emissions. About one-fifth of the Stoxx Europe 600 and about one-quarter of S&P500 companies link director compensation to ESG achievements. For the natural resource-heavy FTSE 100 the proportion is about one-third, according to Bloomberg data.Even these pioneers tend to link only a small portion of total pay to ESG goals — typically a chunk of the annual bonus.Instead, the vast majority of more lucrative long-term incentive plans are still based on profit and stock performance, according to a recent FTI Consulting and CGLytics analysis of U.K. and Irish compensation practices. “We anticipate greater pressure from investors on companies to align management incentives with ESG-related metrics,” the authors concluded.Some companies are getting ahead of the curve. At life sciences and material sciences company Royal DSM N.V., 50% of long-term pay incentives are linked to energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions improvements. Oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc, mining group BHP Group Ltd. and German engineering company Siemens AG have all announced plans to bolster the link between pay and cutting emissions.For some observers, rewarding executives simply for doing the right thing can seem perverse and unnecessary. They argue there's no contradiction between pursuing long-term financial success and being a good corporate citizen, although there are plenty of industries that last pretty well without being virtuous.I’m more sympathetic to the argument that compensation plans are already too complex and opaque. Unless ESG-related pay metrics are clear and quantifiable, it might be difficult to hold executives to account. “Accountability to everyone means accountability to no one,” the Council of Institutional Investors complained last year.Sometimes, though, trade-offs between profits, people and the planet are unavoidable. The climate crisis demands that a company makes investments now that might impair short-term profitability but which will position the business to thrive in the difficult decades ahead. The same goes for paying workers a decent wage, which will enable a thriving middle class. Executives shouldn’t be penalized for doing the right thing, just as they shouldn’t reap rewards for neglecting their non-investor stakeholders such as customers, staff and the public (as was the case with Boeing, Persimmon and Volkswagen AG’s diesel scandal).One way to satisfy those purists who say shareholder value trumps all might be to maintain the financial emphasis of executive incentive plans but apply a sustainability adjustment, as German utility RWE AG, ThyssenKrupp AG and others do. The formula works something like this: So you achieved your profit targets? Good. But did you do it without screwing up the planet or screwing over suppliers? If not, you’re only getting a fraction of your bonus.Of course, if the Business Roundtable’s conversion to stakeholder capitalism is to be more than just good PR, the quantum of executive pay might need rethinking too. Would an executive who treats shareholders, employees and communities equally accept pay that’s more than 100 times the typical worker? Or would they settle for less?(1) In fairness, Persimmon's annual bonus system includes &quot;customer care&quot; and health and safety elements. However, the long term incentive plan which produced this massive payout was based on dividends paid.To contact the author of this story: Chris Bryant at cbryant32@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2020-01-20,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Fever-Tree gin and tonic has lost its fizz.Fevertree Drinks Plc on Monday warned on profits, sending its shares down as much as 26%. The pioneer in high-end cocktail mixers said sales expanded by just 10% last year and earnings fell 5% compared with 2018. That’s a stark contrast to previous statements from the maker of Sicilian lemon tonic water and spiced orange ginger ale, which usually upgraded expectations.Part of the reason for the warning — slow sales in supermarkets — looks plausible. Britain’s grocers endured a sluggish Christmas and New Year’s trading period. The Boris bounce that was supposed to have Brits lifting the glasses after a decisive December election didn’t materialize. What’s more worrying is that the market for bars and clubs suffered over the holidays, too. That’s a concern given that the broader sector for eating and drinking out had a solid Christmas, according to industry data from the Coffer Peach Business Tracker.There was also unwelcome news out of the U.S., where Chief Executive Officer Tim Warrillow said the company is cutting its prices, from those prevalent at the very top end of the drinks market to merely premium. Consequently, Fevertree is forecasting sales expansion there by a percentage in the low double digits this year, compared with 33% in 2019. Not only is this mysterious — surely Fevertree’s issue was building brand awareness not pricing — but it is a concern for investors, as demand on the other side of the Atlantic was supposed to pick up as the U.K. matured.Fevertree signaled that U.K. growth could accelerate later this year, particularly in comparison with such a difficult 2019. But that looks optimistic. Not only do consumers show no signs of loosening the purse strings, but the danger is that their appetites may have shifted permanently away from the gin and tonics that had them reaching for Fevertree mixers.The U.S. is expected to expand more quickly after 2020, but this is not guaranteed, and it’s some way off anyway. And in the meantime Fevertree is facing competition from all sides from small niche players to big beverage companies such as Coca-Cola Co. For now at least, investors can’t count on this market for the next leg of growth.  With Monday’s lurch downwards, Fevertree shares have lost more than 60% of their value compared with their peak in September 2018. And despite Fevertree’s optimism, it’s hard to see a quick bounce back from here. When high flyers lose their momentum, it can be difficult to recapture: Just look at online retailer Asos Plc, which has struggled to recover from a profit warning in December 2018.The only silver lining is that with Fevertree’s historic premium to rivals slashed, it  could encourage a big beverage or consumer goods company to slot it into their portfolios. But, like investors, they may want to see evidence that the company is stabilizing. After all, its attraction was fast growth, and while 10% revenue expansion is still much better than what’s currently to be had in consumer goods or food retail, it’s not at the levels Fevertree enjoyed over the past few years.It’s clearly not yet the time to say cheers.To contact the author of this story: Andrea Felsted at afelsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Melissa Pozsgay at mpozsgay@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-01-27,"(Bloomberg) -- The sometimes strained relationship between Ankara and Washington may be enjoying a period of calm, giving Istanbul stocks “a window of opportunity” to gain in 2020, said one of Turkey’s best-performing equity fund managers.A steady stream of negative headlines testing the alliance has stopped since Iran-U.S. tensions threatened to escalate into conflict. It seems that the crisis has been good in reducing relative risks attached to Turkey’s market, said Haydar Acun, the managing partner at Marmara Capital in Istanbul.A series of clashes with the U.S. in recent years culminated in the fallout from Turkey’s decision to purchase a Russian missile defense system that started arriving in July. Even so, a cordial personal relationship between presidents Donald Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdogan has survived the disputes. And while plans for parts of a battery of U.S. sanctions against Turkey have progressed, the punitive measures have yet to be imposed.“I do not expect things to get significantly worse from here as far as U.S.-Turkey relations are concerned for about nine months to a year, until the U.S. Presidential elections, and that’s likely to help Turkish equities’ risk premiums drop,” Acun said in an interview.Acun’s Marmara Capital Asset Management Equity Fund returned 75% in 2019 compared with a gain of 25% for the benchmark BIST 100 Index. That performance was pipped only by Is Investment’s index-tracking technology stocks fund, according to the Turkey Electronic Fund Platform.ETF InflowsInvestors poured $11.2 million into the two largest exchange-traded funds that focused on Turkish equities last week. The benchmark index was 0.8% lower Monday, joining a global sell-off as concerns about the deadly coronavirus outbreak increased risk aversion.Acun expects improved economic growth and falling interest rates to also support local equities this year. “As long as there’s not another major geopolitical crisis, we don’t see an imminent threat that can weigh on Turkish markets.”The rally in Turkish equities that has carried the benchmark index to record highs this year was largely driven by gains in shares in small and medium-cap companies that started in the second half of 2019. While these segments have been a favorite allocation for Acun, he is moving in 2020 into shares of larger-capitalized, core industrial companies that he said have been laggards. As a result, he has added Anadolu Efes, Coca Cola Icecek, Borusan and Petkim to the fund.Here are some other opinions from the interview with Acun:Sees banks rallying fast should there be a thorough plan to tackle non-performing loans. About 20% of his investments are in lenders.In this sector, he has positions in Akbank, Halkbank and Yapi Kredi. Acun said he may increase his position in Yapi Kredi as he sees Unicredit’s stake sale in the company as a positive in resolving problems related to management.Foreign investor perception of Turkey risks remains bad. But he doesn’t expect further outflows. “Those who didn’t want to take the risk left anyway.”(Adds capital flows into ETFs and Monday’s equity market performance in sixth paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Tugce Ozsoy in Istanbul at tozsoy1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Blaise Robinson at brobinson58@bloomberg.net, ;Onur Ant at oant@bloomberg.net, John Viljoen, Celeste PerriFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Lull in U.S.-Turkey Spats Is a ‘Window’ for Istanbul Stocks

Motion has been a part of human thought ever since we could walk upright, if not before. Our Masters in Business guest this week, Barbara Tversky, professor of experimental psychology at Stanford and Columbia University, believes action is the key factor driving human cognitive development. The author of more than 200 research papers, her new book is &quot;Mind in Motion: How Action Shapes Thought.&quot;Tversky’s research focuses on visual-spatial reasoning and collaborative cognition. She discusses the interplay of mind and body in enabling cognition. Consider gesture as an example. Tversky argues that gesturing is more than just a by-product of speech: it literally helps us to think. An experiment in her book is to try to explain out loud how to get from your house to the supermarket, train station, your office or school while you sit on your hands. It turns out to be very difficult. Without gesture, speaking is difficult, and we occasionally can’t find the words.Tversky was married to the deceased psychologist Amos Tversky, and helped Michael Lewis do his research for his book on Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, &quot;The Undoing Project.&quot;Her favorite books can be seen here.You can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, Overcast, Spotify, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher.

2020-01-28,"Coca-Cola shares have climbed 20% in the last year. Now, what's next for KO stock as it expands its non-sugary drink portfolio?",Coca-Cola Q4 Earnings Preview: What's Next for KO Stock?
2020-01-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The initial reaction on Wednesday to Facebook Inc.’s fourth-quarter earnings revealed investors’ disappointment. Revenue climbed just 25%, the slowest ever, though it topped analysts’ estimates, Bloomberg reported.Shares fell in after-market trading on concern that perhaps the company has peaked.In truth, there’s no reason Facebook’s revenue should slow. The problem is that it’s leaving far too much money on the table.The world’s largest social media company likes to boast about its international reach, with 2.5 billion monthly active users. Perhaps Coca-Cola is the only company with wider global recognition.Yet Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has failed to fully capitalize on the 2.2 billion Facebook users who are not in North America. The numbers tell the story. The U.S. and Canada account for 10% of Facebook’s MAUs but 49% of revenue. The Asia-Pacific region, on the other hand, accounts for 41% of users  — more than 1 billion people — but generates just 17.4% of the company’s revenue.Purchasing power is one reason, but that’s an insufficient explanation. In Europe, for example, the average user generated $13.21 last quarter. That’s just one-third of the $41.41 garnered in the U.S. and Canada. World Bank data shows that North Americans are on average wealthier than Europeans, but they’re 67% richer, not three times richer. In Asia-Pacific, the differential is almost 12 times, compared with the five-times gap for per capita GDP, according to World Bank data.Alphabet Inc.’s Google is in a similar situation, with 46% of its revenue coming from the U.S., a third from Europe and just 16% from Asia-Pacific.Given that Google has a commanding share of the global smartphone market with its Android operating system, its results from Asia could also be regarded as underperformance. Its European contribution is more in line with expectations for an international business. The key difference is that Google, which is built around search, faces a solid local competitor in many markets it operates.Outside of China, where few of its 1.4 billion citizens are users, Facebook is a dominant force almost everywhere thanks to its suite of apps including Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. There are myriad explanations for why America drives Facebook revenue: It’s a large sophisticated market; advertisers are social savvy; internet penetration is high. But each of those reasons has a rebuttal.In Indonesia, a nation with more than 150 million internet and social media users, Facebook properties occupy the top three spots by both downloads and use, according to the latest annual digital report by Hootsuite and WeAreSocial. And the Southeast Asian nation leads by most measures that might indicate the prospective value of a consumer to advertising clients. It leads the U.S. in use rates of mobile messaging, videos, games and even banking, while a higher proportion of people have searched for or purchased a product online.In Vietnam, where Facebook has 61 million monthly users, engagement rates are similar or higher than those for the U.S., according to Hootsuite and WeAreSocial. For Brazil, where the company has more than 130 million users, Facebook accounts for three of the top four social media platforms; engagements also look strong. And then there’s India. The nation has 1.19 billion mobile phone connections and 300 million Facebook users, surpassing the U.S. Sure, Indian consumers aren’t as affluent, but data indicates that paid reach — a measure of how many people saw a paid post from an advertiser’s page — is on par with the U.S. while other engagement figures look similarly lucrative. Executives noted last year that revenue will most likely take a hit as it deals with increased scrutiny and regulation in the U.S. and elsewhere. At the same time, data suggests that election years aren’t the boon for revenue that one might imagine. Yet the company still seems overly focused on its home market.However you look at it, Facebook’s global reach has great potential. It’s an opportunity the company needs to work harder to exploit.To contact the author of this story: Tim Culpan at tculpan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-01-30,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak an international emergency earlier today, sending riskier assets lower in the process. That call makes sense because the number of confirmed cases and deaths are rising rapidly, reaching 7,700 and 170, respectively, as of early Thursday.Source: Provided by Finviz   * The S&P 500 rose 0.31%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.43%.  * The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.26%.  * There aren't many Dow winners to discuss today, but Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was easily the standout, jumping 2.82% following its Wednesday afternoon earnings report.In addition to the virus concerns, some economic data released today provided unwanted headwinds for stocks. The Commerce Department said fourth-quarter GDP rose 2.1%, but some economists were critical of that figure, saying it was attributable to lower imports, not increased business investment.Another &quot;trouble spot&quot; on the economic front was the consumer spending that showed that metric increased just 1.8% in the fourth quarter following a 3.2% gain in the third quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn other words, there were enough negative or tepid headlines today to facilitate a mediocre day on the Dow Jones with just 14 of the index's 30 residents higher in late trading. Marvels of MicrosoftAs noted above, Microsoft was by far the Dow's top performer today, delivering the type of post-earnings surge some thought the stock was capable of prior to that announcement. In its fiscal second quarter, Microsoft notched GAAP earnings of $1.51 per share on revenue of $36.91 billion. Wall Street was expecting earnings of of $1.32 per share and $35.67 billion in sales.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for February Contrarians Predictably, investors are fawning over what Microsoft had to say about its Azure cloud business. Azure revenue surged 62% in the fiscal second quarter, a stunning increase to be sure.&quot;Results continue to underscore our thesis, which centers on customer adoption of hybrid cloud environments with Azure,&quot; said Morningstar. &quot;Microsoft continues to use its dominant position of on-premises architecture to allow customers to move to the cloud easily and at their own pace, which we believe will continue over the next five years.&quot; The Fizz Is InRivaling Microsoft for top Dow honors today was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which surged 3.21% to an all-time high on the back of an impressive fourth-quarter earnings report. The world's largest soft drink maker said it earned 44 cents on sales of $9.07 billion in the last three months of 2019, topping analysts' estimates calling for revenue of $8.89 billion.Atlanta-based Coca-Cola forecast full-year 2020 earnings of $2.25 per share, slightly below the $2.26 analysts are expecting, but investors clearly didn't mind as highlighted by the stock's stellar showing. Bad News BearsInvestors hoping that 2020 would bring better things for the energy sector will have to either wait a little longer or avoid the group over the near-term because the coronavirus has sent oil into a bear market, weighing on the likes of Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) along the way.In late trading, both stocks were higher, but today is just one day. Both oil giants are locked in multi-week losing streaks and both are down more than 8% to start 2020. Feeling the BernAs I noted earlier this week, Sen. Bernie Sanders' increasing momentum in the Democratic primary field is a problem for managed care providers, including Dow component UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). UNH was lower by about 1% today, extending its one-week slide to 7%, a decline materializing around news that Sanders is looking strong heading into the Iowa caucus next week.A recent note by UBS analyst Keith Parker, cited by Barron's, says that for every 10% Sanders and rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren gain in the polls, the S&P 500 could be subject to a 1% drop.Both contenders are supporters of Medicare For All, the issue that has frequently plagued UNH stock. However, Sanders has recently been the more vocal proponent of nationalized healthcare. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayI'm fond of the advice about not getting caught up in one-day moves, regardless of direction. That said, the major averages had every reason to close lower today and did just the opposite. Indeed, that's a positive sign.Conversely, there is some nourishment for the worriers among us. Strength in equities is largely being confined to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft and a few other mega-cap names that are taking on disproportionately large shares of the S&P 500.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-01-30,"Coronavirus headlines again commanded attention from investors on Thursday, in spite of a number of large earnings reports. Let's look at a few top stock trades, as the headlines continue to fly. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Microsoft (MSFT)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares were pressing higher on Thursday, hitting another all-time high. The move comes following the company's better-than-expected quarterly results.But what now? The stock isn't advancing in very convincing fashion, fading from its opening levels. Shares did pullback a bit on Monday, but quickly erased those losses ahead of the print.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf shares unwind a bit more, let's see if the 20-day moving average and channel support buoy the name once more. On a correction to this level, investors may consider buying the dip -- provided the overall market remains in relatively good health.Below these marks, though, and the 50-day moving average is in play. Should MSFT resist pulling back from current levels, see if it can ride prior channel resistance higher and take out Thursday's high. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Altria (MO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAltria (NYSE:MO) took another big writedown on its Juul unit and reduced its long-term earnings growth outlook. The stock responded with a selloff, which seems justified in this current environment.So far, support is stepping up from the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, while the $46 level is hard to ignore; This is the zone to watch. Below the 100-day and $46, and MO could tumble to $44 or lower.Above the 200-day moving average, and bulls will need to see if Altria can rally back to its 50-day moving average. If it can, reclaiming this mark and pushing to $51-plus is the next task at hand. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: PayPal (PYPL)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comAfter a lower open, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock is doing its best to erase Thursday morning's post-earnings losses. In doing so, the stock is reclaiming its 20-day moving average.If it continues higher, let's see if PYPL can clear $118 and get up to the $120 level. A move below Thursday's low puts uptrend support (blue line) on the table. Below that, and the $110 level will be in the cards, along with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.With bulls back in control of PayPal -- unlike the situation in Q3 -- I wouldn't mind buying on a dip to the $110 to $112 area. Below the 200-day moving average, though, and PYPL may very well be a no-touch for the time being. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Coca-Cola (KO)  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) continues its slow, but steady run higher. There's something satisfying about watching an old blue-chip, slow-growth stock chug higher on a strong uptrend and trade really well.For KO, the breakout over $55 to start the year gave the stock a much-needed boost of momentum. Shares dipped slightly ahead of earnings, but gapped up over resistance near $57.80 on Thursday on better-than-expected results.Let's see if the stock can hold up above this mark now. If it can, $60-plus is possible. If not, see if the 20-day moving average can support the stock on a pullback. Below that mark, and Wednesday's low at $56.66, and uptrend support (blue line) and the 50-day moving average are on the table.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

The dividend has averaged a yield of about 3%. The latest move upward, in anticipation of what turned out to be very good earnings, dropped that yield to 2.8%.Earnings came in at $2 billion, 48 cents per share, more than doubling 2018's $870 million and 20 cents, while revenue of $9.1 billion was up 16% on last year's $7.8 billion. The numbers were only a slight beat on estimates and the stock rose about 3%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Conservative GrowthThe numbers, and the reaction to them, mask the basic truth of Coca-Cola as an investment. This is one of the most conservative stocks you can own. The company has raised its dividend for 57 consecutive years.Coca-Cola is conservative in the nicest possible way. Profits grow slowly, but steadily. The company is constantly adjusting the product mix and marketing message to meet changing tastes. This time it was Fuze tea and various flavors of Coke that got the credit.  * 7 Under-the-Radar European Stocks to Buy for 2020 Revenues had been declining since 2015, but 2019 represented a return to growth of about 10%. This is another knob the company can adjust. It bought out bottlers early in the last decade, then refranchised them later in the decade. This is similar to what fast food companies can do, either controlling all the cash as Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) does or holding just the most profitable franchise parts as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) does.These structural changes led Credit Suisse to upgrade Coca-Cola shares early in January, driving the rally. Coca-Cola passed its 100th anniversary as a publicly traded company last year and has always communicated with the Street. Coffee or Plastic?If you're looking for what's next, Coca-Cola completed the acquisition of Costa Coffee last year. Costa is one of the biggest coffee shop franchises Americans have never heard of, but it's very big in the United Kingdom, where it rivals Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).Costa was the first big deal for the company under Englishman James Quincey, who became CEO in 2017. Costa had 449 shops in China at the time of the deal. It also sells a packaged coffee called Costa Express.Quincey's second big deal has been to treat Coca-Cola itself as a brand, not a soda. In addition to various &quot;flavors&quot; of Coke, there are now Coca Cola Energy drinks, with extra caffeine and additives like Guarana.At this year's World Economic Forum Coke came under fire for its use of plastic bottles, which are much lighter than glass and thus cheaper to transport. The company responded with a plan to move toward biodegradable plastics. As with everything else, it will move deliberately. The Bottom Line on Coca-Cola StockAs investors grow more cautious, stocks like Coca-Cola become more popular.Coke shares fell almost 50% during the 2008 financial meltdown but quickly began recovering in 2009. Their strength led the general market early in the decade, then fell behind, but the shares have doubled in value during the recovery.When a new recession hits, expect that pattern to return. The company's share price passed its 2008 high early in 2011 and never looked back, while delivering steadily rising income.That's what you're looking for when you buy Coca-Cola. It won't make you rich, but the stock symbol KO won't hurt you either.Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

2020-02-04,Is (KO) Outperforming Other Consumer Staples Stocks This Year?,Has Coca-Cola (KO) Outpaced Other Consumer Staples Stocks This Year?
2020-02-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Most investors define value too narrowly, looking at price-to-earnings or price-to-book-value ratios. That misses key components of what makes a stock cheap, says this week's guest on Masters in Business, Chris Davis, chairman and chief executive officer of Davis Selected Advisors LP, which oversees more than $25 billion in mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and separately managed accounts.He offered this example: When insurance company Geico first began using Google advertising for customer acquisition, each new lead cost about $2. The next nearest customer acquisition vehicle for the insurer? Late-night cable television advertising, at a cost of $30 per customer. That enormous differential explained why Google was poised to take so much ad revenue from traditional media outlets. It also suggested that using the P/E ratio to determine how cheap or expensive Google gave a distorted and inaccurate valuation.Davis discussed the firm’s early days in the late 1960s, when it was running separately managed accounts, and decided to move into mutual funds after being asked to do so by several clients. Four decades later, similar requests from clients led the firm into ETFs. The firm’s four main investment strategies include concentrated versions of U.S., international, global and financials funds.Davis also sits on the board Coca Cola Co. and is vice chairman of the American Museum of Natural History.His favorite books can be seen here; a transcript of our conversation is here.You can stream/download the full conversation, including the podcast extras on Apple iTunes, Overcast, Spotify, Google, Bloomberg and Stitcher. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here.Next week, we geek out on cars with Hannah Elliot, reviewer of supercars for Bloomberg.To contact the author of this story: Barry Ritholtz at britholtz3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: James Greiff at jgreiff@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Barry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-02-04,"There are thousands of stocks traded in the major exchanges, and it’s not easy to track their movements. A head for numbers helps, but so does a knack for timing. Understanding both helps to make sense of the earnings season.Once every quarter, publicly traded companies are required to release their financial results – revenues, sales numbers, earnings, and the like. These are the metrics that stock followers use to decide their investment allocations, and share prices tend to rise and fall on the expectations, and the realities, of the quarterly reports.Just last week, three great stalwarts of the Dow Jones index reported their earnings for the final quarter of calendar year 2019. The Dow, of course, is the classic stock index – a group of 30 companies selected to represent the larger market, as their smaller number makes them easier to track collectively – and the companies comprising the index are major names in their sectors.Using the Stock Comparison tool from TipRanks, we can look at these three companies, side by side, comparing their attributes. All are Buy-rated, show an upside between 5% and 10%, and are on an upward trajectory. Let’s take a closer look. McDonald’s Corporation (MCD)McDonald’s – the modern fast-food colossus created from the vision of salesman Ray Kroc – has shown strong gains in recent years, the fruits of an ambitious turnaround plan by now-former CEO Steve Easterbrook. While Easterbrook had to leave the company in disgrace this past November, causing the stock to dip sharply in response, his plan continues to bolster the company’s prospects. MCD shares gained 12% in 2019, less than the broader market but still a reliable gain. Also good for investors is the dividend, which at 2.31%, yields significantly more than the market average.The company’s earnings disappointed in Q3, but Q4 gave MCD shares a boost. EPS came in at $1.97 and revenues were reported at $5.3 billion, both in line with the Street’s forecast. The numbers were a relief, coming from a company that had to fire its CEO during the quarter. In better news for investors, and a testament to the company’s success at rebranding itself, global same-store sales numbers grew 5.9%, well above the forecast. Investors have been sanguine about MCD’s prospects heading into 2020, and the stock is up 9% so far this year.Writing on the stock for Evercore ISI, 5-star analyst David Palmer says, “We believe 2020 is positioned to be a strong year for McDonald’s. A large portion of the US EOTF investment heavy lifting is in the rear view mirror and there is strong system alignment around the outlook for 2020 with a focus on: 1) advertising effectiveness, 2) value marketing efficiency, 3) premium menu innovation/renovation, 4) improving focus on operations, and 5) technology integration…”In line with his bullish view of the stock, Palmer maintains his Buy rating and puts a $230 price target on MCD, implying a possible upside of 7%. (To watch Palmer’s track record, click here)McDonald’s holds a Strong Buy consensus rating from the analysts, based on a lopsided split of 16 Buys to 3 Holds. There are no sell-side reviews. Shares are trading for $215.18, and the $229.88 average price target suggests a potential upside of 7%. (See McDonald’s stock analysis on TipRanks) Coca-Cola Company (KO)Our next stock is a beloved staple of Warren Buffett’s portfolio. The investing guru has always loved the product, but even more, he loves the stock. Coke’s superb branding (everyone recognizes it), long-term gains (it’s up 41% over the past five years), and its reliable dividend (at 2.74%, the yield beats the market average and Treasury bonds) combine to make the stock a fine vehicle for steady returns.Coke’s steady momentum shows in its 2019 gain of 20%. It underperformed the broader market by about a third, but nothing seems to slow it down. The 40-cent dividend is reliable, paid out every quarter, and the 71% payout ratio shows that the company can afford the dividend and is committed to sharing profits with stockholders. This is a near-perfect long-term investment, as Buffett would attest.KO met or exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for 2H19, with solid performances in both Q3 and Q4. The Q4 report showed EPS as forecasted, at 44 cents, while revenues beat the consensus estimate at $9.07 billion. Even though soda consumption has been slowing in recent quarters, the company has compensated with a combination of new products and smaller cans. This drove a 135% increase in net income from the year-ago quarter.The analysts are pleased with Coke’s performance. Nik Modi, of RBC Capital, laid it out clearly, saying, “KO continued to ride on its momentum and exited 2019 with solid results, with a top-line beat and in-line earnings growth. 2020 guidance was in line with consensus and our expectations. A really good quarter with hardly any holes to poke.”Modi gives KO shares a Buy rating with a $66 price target, raised from his previous target of $60. His new target implies room for 13% share appreciation. (To watch Modi’s track record, click here)Analyst Stephen Powers of Deutsche Bank concurs, writing in his recent review of the stock, “We have great confidence that KO is well-positioned to grow in line with its +4-6% top-line algorithm into the future, given global revenue growth management initiatives, innovation, portfolio expansion, and general global system alignment.”Powers maintains his Buy rating and $64 price target, indicating 9% upside potential. (To watch Powers’ track record, click here)With 14 reviews, including 11 Buys and 3 Holds, KO shares have a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The average price target of $63.57 suggests upside potential of 9% from the current share price of $58.58. (See Coca-Cola stock analysis on TipRanks) Apple, Inc. (AAPL)Last up is Apple, Steve Jobs’ baby that continues to shape the way we interact with the digital world. From the iPod to the wearable Apple Watch, this company has always positioned itself with one foot solidly at the forefront of technology. The strategy has worked, and today, Apple is the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $1.35 trillion.Like the other stocks on this list, Apple has momentum on its side. Shares are up 160% over the past five years, rose 89% in 2019, and have started 2020 with a 5% gain. It’s a steady record of share appreciation for stockholders’ benefit. The company pays a modest dividend, with a yield of just 1%, but the payment is reliable. Apple has also raised the dividend twice in the last three years.Adding to the good news, AAPL beat the forecasts in every quarter of calendar year 2019, with the fourth (fiscal Q1) showing the widest margin. EPS beat the forecast by 44 cents, coming in at $4.99. Revenues were $91.8 billion, where the forecast was $88.5 billion. Additionally, iPhone revenues rose after a disappointing Q3, gross margins rose to 38.4%, and the company raised its Q2 guidance.Among the bulls is Brian White, of Monness. He says of AAPL, “Looking forward, we anticipate healthy demand for Services and Wearables to continue. Also, we expect Apple to benefit from the launch of its first 5G iPhones in September… Our balanced view of this cycle reflects the maturity of the smartphone market and our expectation that consumers will take a measured approach to upgrading to 5G…”White raised his price target on AAPL from $300 to $370, implying an upside of 20%, and gives the stock a Buy rating. (To watch White’s track record, click here)In agreement with White is Daniel Ives, 5-star analyst from Wedbush. After watching the Q1 earnings presentation, Ives said, “We … view last night as one of Cook’s crowning achievements which put the finishing touches on a comeback story for the records books.” Ives believes that Apple will reach a $2 trillion valuation within two years.In line with his uber-bull stance, Ives gives AAPL shares a $400 price target and Buy rating. His target indicates confidence in a 30% upside potential for the stock. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)Apple has the most mixed reviews of the stocks on this list, 36 of them, including 22 Buys, 12 Holds, and 2 Sells. Shares are not cheap, at $308.66, and the $340.43 average price target suggests an upside potential of 10%.

2020-02-06,"When it comes to dividend stocks, yield isn't everything. If you're an income investor in it for the long haul, you know that steadily rising payouts are a vital factor, too.For one, dividend increases lift the yield on an investor's original cost basis, meaning today's 1% yield might be much more in the future. They're also indicative of a firm's ability to withstand the ups and downs of the economy, as well as the stock market.Enter the Dividend Aristocrats.The Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the S&P; 500 Index that have improved their annual payouts every year for at least 25 consecutive years. It's a mix of household names as well as companies with less name recognition that nonetheless play an outsize role in the American economy, even if it's mostly behind the scenes. But all of them offer some size, longevity and familiarity, providing comfort amid market uncertainty.Here are the current 64 Dividend Aristocrats - including the newest faces that were just added in January 2020. These have been among the best dividend stocks for income growth over the past few decades, and they're a great place to start if you're looking to add new dividend holdings to your long-term portfolios.

2020-02-07,"PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) reports its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 13 before the markets open. And despite PepsiCo stock gaining more than 27% over the past year, shareholders can't afford any bad news.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.com Currently, PEP stock is trading around the $144 level, which is 33 times its free cash flow for the trailing 12 months. Therefore, the company does not a lot of room for error next week.However, I don't think that will matter, and here's why.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Earnings ExpectationsAnalysts expect earnings per share (EPS) for PepsiCo to be $1.44 in Q4 2019, and $5.51 for fiscal year 2019. That's down five cents from Q4 2018 and 15 cents from fiscal 2018, respectively -- and that's bad news.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Buy for Big Gains in 2020 The good news, however, is that analysts expect it to earn $5.95 for FY2020 -- 44 cents higher than this past year. But, it's important to note that as we've moved closer to the upcoming earnings announcement, analysts have gotten more conservative in their outlook.Three months ago, nine analysts had a buy or overweight rating on PepsiCo stock. Today, though, that figure has dropped down to seven. Worse still, the average target price is currently $140.12, about 2.7% lower than its current share price.Nonetheless, I like to consider the glass half full. Pepsi is still going to earn close to $6 a share in 2020. Furthermore, in October, it beat expectations on both the top- and bottom-line, with CEO Ramon Laguarta stating that it would &quot;meet or exceed our full-year organic growth target of 4%.&quot;That said, the company's product lines appear to be stronger than ever. Bubly Taking Market ShareCurrently, PepsiCo boasts an impressive 22 billion-dollar brands. Suspiciously absent from this list, however, is Bubly sparkling water, which the company only launched in early 2018. Using Canadian singer Michael Buble as its pitchman, the company's humorous ads have generated serious buzz -- quickly boosting its market share.In January, Nielsen named 25 consumer packaged goods brands that it thought were innovating their way to growth. Bubly made the list, as did several other beverage brands, including Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) Dunkin' Donuts Bottled Ice Coffee.The reality is that Bubly is taking market share from Lacroix. Bubly generated $300 million in annualized revenue not too long after its 2018 launch, and is expected to join Pepsi's elite billion-dollar club soon.Sure, it might only generate 2% of the annual revenue that its legacy Pepsi brand does, but having another growth vehicle in the house can't hurt. To have 22 brands generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue provides the ultimate in diversification.Therefore, I continue to expect Bubly to deliver the goods. What About SodaStream?It's been a little more than a year since Pepsi completed its $3.2 billion acquisition of SodaStream. As far back as 2012, I thought SodaStream's products could quench two thirsts: First, that people enjoy drinking carbonated water, and secondly, that they want to do so without killing the planet.&quot;With its customizable options, SodaStream empowers consumers to personalize their preferred beverage in an environmentally friendly way and provides PepsiCo with a significant presence in the at-home marketplace,&quot; PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta stated upon the acquisition's closing.This past Christmas, I bought my wife one as a gift. I can state unequivocally that it's cut down on the number of cans going into the recycling. So in my view, it's a fantastic product that everyone should own.With that said, SodaStream plans to do its best to ensure that it happens in the American market.&quot;Ramon has senior executives at chains like Walmart or Target on his speed dial, and that's the difference. We've already been added to Albertsons, the third largest US retailer,&quot; SodaStream CEO Eyal Shohat said in a recent interview.It's going to take time, but down the road, SodaStream will become a more significant part of the PepsiCo conversation. The Bottom Line on PepsiCo StockOverall, only 1.5% of U.S. households have SodaStream's. The U.S. market only accounts for 15% of the company's estimated annual revenue of $900 million in 2019. This means that if 10% of U.S. households buy a SodaStream in the next 3-5 years, its revenues will double -- and that's solely from the American market. That doesn't take into consideration its global growth.When PepsiCo reports earnings Feb. 13, you won't hear much from Laguarta about SodaStream. And that's a good thing.PepsiCo stock might be expensive today, but in five years -- having bought now -- I doubt you'll look back with regret.So, at 33 times free cash flow, PEP stock is still a buy.At the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-14,"(Bloomberg) -- As Asia-Pacific president of Dow Chemical Co., one of the world’s biggest producers of plastics and chemicals, Jon Penrice has 100 billion reasons to recycle.“About 8 million tons of plastics are going into the ocean annually,” he said in an interview. “If you look at plastic packaging, around 95% is not being recycled each year which is $100 billion worth of plastic, and that’s valuable for entrepreneurs.”At the center of the effort is Asia, which consumes almost half of the world’s plastic packaging, according to BloombergNEF, and imports even more waste from the U.S. and Europe. Solutions -- such as Indian vending machines that turn plastic bottles into polyester, and researchers in Singapore who are working out ways to clean up oil spills using the waste -- will be needed to meet demand for recycled plastics that’s forecast to rise faster than supply.The biggest challenge to the transition is to make recycled plastics at a price and quality that are competitive. Virgin plastic is derived from crude oil and is closely linked to the global oil price. Because the cost of recycled plastic is more stable, it becomes relatively more expensive when crude prices fall.See also: China Upended the Politics of Plastic and the World Is Still ReelingThe complexity of sorting different types of plastic is another hurdle, according to Penrice, as well as dealing with waste at source rather than producing a lot of carbon emissions by sending it half way around the world.An estimated $80 billion-$120 billion of value is lost because of packaging that goes into the environment, said Navneet Chadha, principal operations officer at the World Bank’s International Finance Corp., which helps fund private sector investment in developing countries. “We have to think of used plastic as a resource, not as a waste.”See also: World Seen Struggling to Recycle Even 50% of Its Plastic WasteBut Chadha cautioned that standards for recycled products need to be developed to avoid “unintended consequences”. Using plastic in road construction, for example, needs to be evaluated further as microplastics may be generated as the road decays, he said.Here are some of the ways plastic is being recycled in Asia:Traditional RecyclingPlastic waste is traditionally reused by collecting and sorting refuse and then melting it, a process known as mechanical recycling. Part of the problem is that a lot of garbage is tainted with food or chemicals and can’t cheaply be turned into high quality raw materials.“The biggest challenge is quality of recycled plastic,” said Jean-Marc Boursier, chief operating officer of SUEZ Group, one of the world’s largest recycling companies. “Major consumer goods companies like Danone, Pepsi or Coca Cola will not buy recycled plastic unless they are convinced that the quality is as good as virgin plastic.”SUEZ has nine plants globally that can turn a combined 500,000 tons of waste plastic into 150,000 tons of polymers, used to make shampoo bottles, car interiors and other products. The company is opening its first Asian plastic recycling plant this year in Thailand.Boursier suggests pricing the carbon savings into the recycled plastic price to take into account the environmental benefit.AerogelsA team of researchers at the National University of Singapore has developed a way to convert low-value plastic waste into aerogels -- ultra-light materials used in everything from diaper fillings to cleaning up oil spills.Around eight average plastic water bottles produce a square meter sheet of aerogel using the method, said Duong Hai Minh, an associate professor at the university who worked on the project. The researchers have sold commercial production rights to firms including Bronxculture in Singapore and DPN Aerogel JSC in Vietnam, he said.“People throw away plastic because there they don’t see any value,” Minh said. “As long as we can make it valuable, everyone will keep it and sell it.”HighwaysUsing plastic waste to build roads is gaining in popularity, not least because all types of plastic including difficult-to-recycle multilayered packaging and flexible films and coatings used to wrap chocolates and for food deliveries can be used. Dow Chemical and India’s Reliance Industries Ltd. have developed technologies that use this plastic as a binder, replacing some of the bitumen.The Mukesh Ambani-led company has built 40 kilometers of road at its refineries using plastic that can’t otherwise be recycled, and is in talks with National Highways Authority of India and other road builders about using the technology more widely, said Vipul Shah, chief operating officer for the petrochemicals business.Meanwhile Indian Oil Corp., the country’s biggest refiner, is trying to get the government to make the blending of non-recyclable plastics in road-laying mandatory, said S.S.V. Ramakumar, director of research and development.In the Philippines, San Miguel Corp. laid down its first road combining plastic scraps with asphalt last year, using surface material developed with Dow. The chemicals giant has also helped build plastic-based roads in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the U.S., according to Dow’s Penrice.See also: The Philippines Is Making Roads and Cement With Plastic Garbage“It’s relatively simple from the technology point of view: you shred the plastic waste, some sorting and selection and then you feed it into the existing asphalt machinery,” he said. “Approximately 100 tons of plastic waste can be recycled into a 40-kilometer stretch of road.”TextilesShredding plastic bottles to produce polyester for clothing is another technology that’s gaining traction in Asia. Reliance has set up reverse-vending machines that collect used bottles in exchange for discount coupons that can be redeemed at its company stores.The company, India’s largest petrochemicals manufacturer, can recycle around 2 billion plastic bottles a year, or 33,000 tons, according to Shah. Capacity will be doubled over the next 18 months, he said.BricksSome non-government organizations and companies are looking at ways to use waste plastic to make bricks and other construction materials. The Global Ecobrick Alliance is promoting use of a block tightly crammed with plastic and other recyclables. Qube, an India-based start-up, has developed a brick made entirely of plastic waste. Called the PlastiQube, it’s cheaper and uses less energy to produce than conventional counterparts, according to the company’s website.Chemical RecyclingBreaking down waste plastic into a basic feedstock like naphtha -- a process called pyrolysis -- can reprocess dirty, contaminated plastics like detergent drums and mixed polymers that can’t be dealt with through mechanical recycling.Pyrolysis will provide around 17% of the 19 million tons of plastics recycling capacity required by 2030 in major economies, according to BloombergNEF. Dow will source oil feedstock made using pyrolysis from Dutch company Fuenix Ecogy Group, while Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA have partnered with start-ups to increase use of the technology.“Mechanical recycling will continue to be cheaper,” said Boursier at SUEZ, which is setting up a pyrolysis pilot project in Bristol in the U.K. “But for complex or polluted plastic, chemical recycling will be the future.”(Company corrects second paragraph to show $100 billion is the value of all plastic packaging that’s not being recycled)To contact the reporters on this story: Saket Sundria in Singapore at ssundria@bloomberg.net;Debjit Chakraborty in New Delhi at dchakrabor10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Andrew Janes, Adam MajendieFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Diapers to Bricks: A $100 Billion Plastic Challenge

2020-02-21,"It was a miserable end to the week for equities as investors ditched riskier assets for safe-haven fare, such as the dollar and gold. Yes, that's correct. Despite the U.S. Dollar Index popping today, dollar-denominated gold closed at multi-year highs while stocks tumbled.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 slid 1.05%.  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 0.78%.  * The Nasdaq Composite plunged 1.79%.  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the worst-performing Dow name today, underscoring weakness across the large-cap tech space.Covid-19 concerns were again at the center of the broader market decline, but as was noted yesterday, markets are getting wise to the fact that this issue isn't confined to China -- or Asia for that matter -- and data are confirming as much.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsEarlier today, the IHS Markit purchasing managers' index for February checked in at 49.6, a decline of 3.7 points from January and good for the worst reading in more than six years.The weakness &quot;was in part linked to the coronavirus outbreak, manifesting itself in weakened demand across sectors such as travel and tourism, as well as via falling exports and supply chain disruptions,&quot; according to IHS Markit.  * 7 Delicious Restaurant Stocks to Buy In late trading, 21 of the Dow's 30 components were lower and more than half that group were down 1% or more. Conversely, none of the winners were up 1%. Coke And CoronavirusBefore jumping into Friday's tech wreck, let's have a look at Dow component Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). The defensive stock was up about half a percent in late trading, but investors may do well to not be deceived here.The company became the latest to warn that the novel coronavirus will affect its earnings, warning of a modest impact to first-quarter results. Fortunately, the soft drink giant said it still expects to earn $2.25 a share this year.That's likely the reason why Coca-Cola traded higher today. That and its status as a defensive name. Including Coca-Cola, three of the Dow's four consumer staples residents were in the green today. Usual SuspectsAlthough company-specific news for many of the following names was light to non-existent today, China-sensitive names such as Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) were among the Dow's worst offenders.In fact, all of the Dow's technology constituents traded lower today. The only Dow Jones stock with significant China exposure that was higher, and only modestly so, was Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). That was more a sympathy play on Deere & Company's (NYSE:DE) strong earnings report than anything else. Visa VexedVisa (NYSE:V) couldn't escape the tech carnage today, though there was one encouraging news item out on the name. Brazilian state-controlled bank Caixa Economica Federa is working with Visa on credit and debit cards in that country. That bank issues 109.3 million of those cards and Brazil is Latin America's largest economy. Speaking of Credit CardsAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) was another Dow offender and this is very much a coronavirus-to-blame situation. With global travel expected to slump due to the virus, AXP could be pinched.AXP is one of Warren Buffett's &quot;big four&quot; holdings and the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) annual shareholder letter, always widely anticipated, is due out this weekend, so there could be some AXP commentary in there. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayBeyond the coronavirus, there's another issue that could act as a headwind for stocks: they're getting expensive as John Butters of FactSet points out.&quot;The forward 12-month P/E ratio of 19.0 on February 19 was above the four most recent historical averages for the S&P 500: five-year (16.7), 10-year (14.9), 15-year (14.6), and 20-year (15.5),&quot; said Butters in a note. &quot;In fact, this marked the first time the forward 12- month P/E had been equal to (or above) 19.0 since May 23, 2002 (19.1).&quot;Of course, equities can get pricey and continue climbing, but a more sanguine environment than one riddled by fatal illnesses is probably necessary for that to happen.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not own any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-02-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is taking aim at the urban grocery market with a larger version of its cashierless Go convenience store.The company on Tuesday opened the first Go Grocery, located in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, not far from the online retailer’s headquarters. The store is about five times the size of a typical Amazon Go -- meaning it can accommodate shopping carts -- and carries baked goods, meat, produce and household items.Amazon is betting a frictionless checkout experience will help it grab a bigger share of the $800 billion U.S. grocery market, now dominated by Walmart Inc.The Go Grocery stocks about 5,000 items, compared with 500 to 700 in a typical Go store, said Cameron Janes, who oversees the Go project along with several other brick-and-mortar experiments. The selection includes non-food staples like paper towels and laundry detergent but stops well short of the array offered at a traditional grocery store. Amazon’s Whole Foods markets carry tens of thousands of products.Like existing Amazon convenience stores in Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco and New York, Go Grocery uses cameras and sensors track people and what they take off the shelf. Shoppers are charged when they exit. But unlike the early stores, the new format has updated versions of the system that can identify produce without wrappers for each apple, cabbage or pineapple. That makes stocking easier and lowers costs in an industry with notoriously tight margins.“We can pretty much handle everything” stocked by a regular grocer, Janes said of the latest technology.During a tour, he showed off grab-and-go food, coffee and baked goods from local purveyors. The store uses the same meat suppliers as the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service, he said, and shares some organic produce and fish suppliers with Whole Foods. Unlike the high-end organic grocer, Go Grocery stocks items like Coca-Cola and Big League Chew bubble gum.Amazon leased the retail space at 610 E. Pike Street in Seattle several years ago with the intention of using it for the first Go store. Given a broad mandate to shake up physical retail, the Go team originally planned to build a checkout-free supermarket, complete with a butcher, cheesemonger and coffee bar.Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos toured a prototype store in late 2015 and said it could confuse customers. Instead, he asked the team to focus on refining the people-tracking technology and checkout experience. Go opened to the public three years later as a convenience store in Amazon’s headquarters, and the original space sat empty -- until now.The new Seattle store won’t be Amazon’s last new take on grocery shopping this year. In Los Angeles, the company is preparing the first in a new line of grocery stores, with traditional checkout counters but distinct from the Whole Foods chain.Amazon is also weighing other Go formats and potentially licensing the technology to other companies, Bloomberg reported last year. Blueprints filed in Washington, D.C. suggest a Go Grocery is coming to the nation’s capital, too.Janes didn’t comment on plans for future stores but said the new Go Grocery will target apartment dwellers rather than the office workers the existing Go stores mostly serve.“This is our first one,” Janes said. “I think we’re going to learn and see where they’re going to work; high-density residential areas is where we’re starting.”(Updates that the store has now opened.)To contact the reporter on this story: Matt Day in Seattle at mday63@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net, Andrew PollackFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Amazon Opens Larger Go Grocery Store in Hometown Seattle

2020-02-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just two weeks ago, the biggest fear frequent fliers faced was having their seatback punched by some jerk or, depending on your point of view, being filmed while punching some jerk’s seat. Now, the Covid-19 coronavirus is spreading steadily around the globe, but the fear it engenders has already done at least three laps. Travelers suddenly face a much more disturbing set of questions than why airplanes bother to make seats that recline if you’re not ever supposed to recline them.Just when you thought flying couldn’t get any more hellacious! Too-small seats are no longer just uncomfortable; they force you to be uncomfortably close to potentially coronavirus-infected fellow travelers. Seatback-punching is no longer just a bizarre outburst of airplane rage; it’s potentially a way to transfer germs from one row of seats to the next. Just the prospect of being cooped up in a flying tin can is enough to make that long-awaited vacation seem more terrifying than relaxing. This poses a real problem for the travel sector, as my colleague Andrea Felsted has detailed, especially since March is a popular time to get away. Colleges and universities would usually be sending their students home for spring break. Those of us in the Northern Hemisphere want to fly somewhere with sun (or snow). And spring is also a popular time for professional conferences.Nonetheless, some companies, like Cargill, Nestle and L’Oreal, have already banned non-essential international travel for their employees for at least the next two weeks. Some schools have canceled study-abroad programs and advised students not to travel to China, even if it’s where they call home.Maybe these are sensible precautions, or maybe they’re just symbolic gestures from leaders who want to be seen to be Doing Something. Other companies, like Coca-Cola and Heinz, have only asked employees to avoid countries experiencing major outbreaks. And the virus doesn’t seem to have slowed fashion industry professionals in Milan or Paris. Paris Fashion Week is continuing on schedule, with many industry workers having traveled directly to Paris from Milan — which is in Lombardy, the part of Italy that has thus far been the most affected.So if you have a trip coming up, should you still go?Over the past few days, a limitless supply of articles has tried to answer this question. The problem, though, is that so much about Covid-19 is still unknown. Thus the basic gist of most of this advice is to use common sense: Don’t go to a country experiencing a major outbreak, wash your hands often, don’t touch your face while you’re traveling, and use extra caution if you’re older or have a compromised immune system. (Older smokers may want to be especially careful, since Covid-19 affects the respiratory system.)I know what the entire internet has to say on this topic because my husband and I have texted approximately all of these articles to each other over the last 48 hours. We are set to celebrate our anniversary with a trip to the French Riviera in a couple of weeks, and the sudden uptick in Covid-19 cases in Europe has sparked a discussion over whether we should cancel. The U.S. government’s travel advice for Europe is rather blasé. Italy, for example, has been added to the list of countries where travelers should “exercise increased caution” — but its overall travel advisory level remains unchanged. The same is true of Spain, where hundreds of holiday-makers have been confined to a hotel in Tenerife, and France, where there have been a handful of cases and at least two deaths. As far as the government is concerned, terrorism and civil unrest are still bigger threats to U.S. travelers in these countries than the virus.As for airplanes — those flying Petri dishes — the chances of catching an illness while confined in one are probably less than we fear. On the one hand, yes, you’re crammed into a confined space with a bunch of strangers, but it’s not that different from being in any other crowded, enclosed space, like a subway car or a movie theater. Plus, that recycled air is filtered through a HEPA filter, the International Air Transport Association notes.Close proximity to sick passengers is the biggest risk factor: If you’re not sitting next to someone sick, you’re much less likely to get sick yourself. (Yes, you can use this column to justify the seat upgrade you’ve been longing for.) Frequent travelers swear by airborne-germ-limiting tactics like shutting off the overhead air vent or choosing a window seat. But the bigger issue may be the globules of sickness lying in wait on oft-touched surfaces: the handle on the lavatory door, the latch on the tray table, the touchscreen on the seatback in front of you, even the in-flight magazine. The solution is simple: Touch them as little as possible and, if you do touch them, wash your hands with soap and water before you touch your face.Everyone’s risk tolerance is different, as is everyone’s definition of “non-essential” travel. For me, the French Riviera sounds pretty darn essential. So unless things take a quick turn for the much worse, I think I’ll get on that airplane — armed with high-octane hand sanitizer and a resolution to leave the in-flight magazine untouched. After all, it’s not as if it’s a cruise ship.To contact the author of this story: Sarah Green Carmichael at sgreencarmic@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Katy Roberts at kroberts29@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Green Carmichael is an editor with Bloomberg Opinion.

2020-03-18,"Morgan Stanley's bullish case for Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ: MNST) can no longer be justified amid the coronavirus outbreak.The Analyst Dara Mohsenian downgraded Coca-Cola's stock from Overweight to Equal-Weight with a price target lowered from $65 to $52.The analyst also downgraded Monster Beverage's stock from Overweight to Equal-Weight with a price target lowered from $78 to $63.The Thesis Mohsenian said government-mandated closures of business, a ban on public gatherings, among other coronavirus-related headwinds dictates a bullish stance on Coca-Cola and Monster Beverage can't be justified. While these trends are mostly understood, the path forward is unclear and there are four main areas of risks for the beverage companies.The risks specific to Coca-Cola include:  1. Lower potential revenue and profit from a shift in sales away from home to take-home.  2. The Costa business is mostly store-based and represents a mid-single-digit rate of total sales.  3. Coca-Cola's bottling partners could require greater financial support.  4. Coca-Cola's debt leverage of 2.7 times 2019 net debt/EBITDA is above its mega-cap peer average of 1.5 times which limits its ability to driving shareholder value.Monster Beverage's exposure to gas stations and convenience stores is a &quot;significant concern&quot; as both end-markets account for around 70% of total sales, the analyst wrote in a note.The company is backed by a &quot;very strong&quot; balance sheet and strategic potential but shares are down just 6% since the start of 2020 (when the note was published), which warrants a cautious move to the sidelines.Price Action Shares of Coca-Cola traded lower by 10% at $42.08 while shares of Monster were also lower by 10% at $54.20 at time of publication.Related Links:The Coronavirus Outbreak's Impact On Global Stocks, Commodities, ETFsBenzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For March 18, 2020Latest Ratings for KO  DateFirmActionFromTo  Jan 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweight  Jan 2020B of A SecuritiesMaintainsBuy  Jan 2020RBC CapitalMaintainsOutperform    View More Analyst Ratings for KO   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Morgan Stanley Upgrades Keurig Dr Pepper On Improved Valuation  * Coca-Cola CEO Says Consumers Will Never Drink The Same Product Forever(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-24,"Stocks surged Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its biggest intraday gain since 2008 amid hopes that Congress and the White House are finally nearing terms on a $2 trillion package aimed at shoring up the U.S. economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.Source: Provided by Finviz  * The S&P 500 jumped 9.34%  * The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 11.26%  * The Nasdaq Composite soared 8.12%  * For what feels like the first time in an eternity, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) was the Dow's top performer today, advancing almost 18%.Equities faltered Monday as partisan politics stood in the way of stimulus efforts, with Senate Republicans accusing their Democratic colleagues in the House of tacking on non-essential, politically-charged amendments to the stimulus package. Dems have naturally lodged similar complaints about their GOP counterparts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsComments from President Trump that he would like to see the U.S. economy reopened by Easter (April 12) contributed to the ebullience on Wall Street, though that forecast for business as usual may prove to be optimistic.  * 7 Stocks Insiders Are Buying Big Amid the Market Panic While stocks remain in a bear market, fertile ground for big one-day rallies as was experienced Tuesday, 28 of 30 Dow stocks were higher in late trading, the best ratio seen in weeks. Cutting MattersIn this environment for energy producers, cutting expenses helps and that explains Chevron's big rally today. The second-largest U.S. oil company said it was halting a $5 billion buyback plan and trimming $4 billion from its exploration budget.That news comes a day after Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing Chevron's credit rating for a possible downgrade. Last week, S&P lowered its rating on CVX rival Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). For now, it looks dividend cuts aren't in the offing for either Chevron or XOM. Speaking of Buybacks…Due to the airlines and Boeing (NYSE:BA) feasting on buybacks during the bull market and now needing government (read: taxpayer) assistance, share repurchase programs are going out of style faster than linen after Labor Day.This is an optics issue, one that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is apparently aware of. Although the semiconductor giant is financially sturdy and not needing a government loan or bailout, it said today it's halting a $20 billion repurchase plan announced last October. Boring Could be Beautiful AgainWith traditional safe-haven sectors, such as consumer staples -- the exception of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) -- and utilities largely failing investors this month, it's understandable that investors have reservations about revisiting these groups.However, some analysts are bullish on names such as Dow component Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and rival PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Coca-Cola recently yanked 2020 guidance due to the coronavirus pandemic, joining a slew of companies in doing so, but J.P. Morgan's Andrea Teixiera highlights Coca-Cola's strong balance sheet and asset-light model as catalysts for the stock in 2021 after the &quot;lost year&quot; of 2020. Can't Get Much WorseAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) was the second-best performer in the Dow today behind Chevron and Visa (NYSE:V) was also among the double-digit winners. Maybe, emphasis on &quot;maybe,&quot; this is a sign of capitulation in these names.Analysts are stepping in, lowering price targets and earnings forecasts on credit stocks, but this was bound to happen. With the travel and leisure industry in the U.S. essentially shutdown and retail stores and malls mostly closed as well, there are few avenues for credit and debit card purchases. Not to mention a slumping economy that may not rebound until well into the third quarter.For the adventurous, profitable, wide-moat names such as AXP and Visa may be worth considering here and certainly so if more declines come to pass. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayWith March nearly in the books, first-quarter earnings season is on the way and, let's be honest, there weren't be much in the way of earnings to speak of. This is widely known fact in the investment community, prompting some to start talking about second-quarter earnings.As John Butters of FactSet points out, the outlook for April through June is getting ugly.&quot;Last week, the aggregate earnings growth rate for Q2 2020 changed from slight year-over-year earnings growth on March 12 (+0.8%) to a slight year-over-year earnings decline on March 13 (-0.7%),&quot; he said.The estimated second-quarter earnings decline for the S&P 500 is 3.9% compared with a 2.9% drop for the current quarter.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-03-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Nothing says funding is not a problem during this crisis than a 10 billion-euro ($11 billion) debt issue. Spain, in a state of emergency because of the coronavirus, achieved this on Tuesday with a seven-year bond sale that attracted more than 36 billion euros of orders.The country was one of 11 high-grade borrowers testing the waters in what was the busiest day of the month for bond sales and the fourth-busiest of the year. This week’s volumes have already surpassed the total of the first three weeks of March, when the outbreak really suppressed supply. Wednesday is set to be even bigger.Raising such a jumbo deal did mean Spain had to offer a yield that was 18 basis points higher than an existing, slightly shorter seven-year bond. Its last syndicated issue, earlier this year, came with a lower yield than its existing debt. However, the world has changed profoundly and issuers have to be prepared to dangle a carrot to entice investor demand. In the circumstances, this wasn’t much of a premium for investors.A similar phenomenon was also evident for the European Investment Bank, whose three-year bond deal came at an 11 basis-point premium to its existing equivalent. Likewise, premiums were in evidence Monday for new deals from the German States of Bavaria and Saxony-Anhalt. Though, again, they weren’t huge, which shows how desperate investors are to find somewhere to put their money.Corporate deals are making a comeback too: Unilever NV and Engie SA last week followed the trend for higher yields. Company issuance has seen the biggest decline in the bond market this year, unsurprisingly give the business shutdowns, running nearly 20% behind last year's pace. Coca Cola European Partners, Sanofi and Nestle SA all came to the market with multi-tranche issues on Tuesday, illustrating the improvement in conditions. Heineken NV, Danaher Corp. and Carrefour SA were doing benchmark euro deals on Wednesday.The European Central Bank can breathe a bit easier as its 1 trillion euros of quantitative easing planned for the rest of this year is starting to take effect. As there will be considerable emphasis on its corporate sector purchasing program, many of the new investment grade deals should benefit from being scooped up by the ECB, if they’re from Europe-based issuing entities.Wednesday has also seen the return of major banks with Lloyds Banking Group Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. all bringing euro deals. Credit spreads (the yield on corporate debt relative to sovereign benchmarks) have ballooned since late February, offering better returns for investors than government bonds if they have cash to put to work. Those spreads will start to narrow, but the virus has created a new paradigm, whereby a decent new-issue premium is essential to a successful deal. Normality is returning to European debt capital markets, but the heady days of super-tight credit spreads and incredibly low non-core government bond yields look to be over.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Marcus Ashworth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering European markets.

2020-03-26,"The stock market is a mess of bearishness and volatility right now. But despite the carnage, a sizable number of stock picks are starting to look better in the eyes of Wall Street's pros, and they're starting to compile some analyst upgrades as a result.The Federal Reserve has introduced aggressive measures and Congress is finalizing a $2 trillion rescue package. That's at least providing a sense that there might be a backstop in place to prevent a total implosion of GDP over the next two quarters. But the hit to corporate profits still is hard to quantify at this point. We know it will be bad once the first-quarter earnings reports start trickling in next month. We just don't know how bad.&quot;We have zero visibility on the earnings front,&quot; says Sonia Joao, a financial advisor based in Houston, Texas. &quot;We're hoping for the best but bracing for the worst and trying to keep our portfolios weighted toward higher-quality names.&quot;Nonetheless, Wall Street's pros are starting to see a brighter picture for a few stock picks. Part of this is simply a function of price: No matter how bad the economic picture looks, at some price, most stocks are worth owning. And in some cases, stock prices have fallen far more than even a worst-case scenario would suggest.&quot;We don't necessarily need things to look good,&quot; says Doug Robinson, principal of San Francisco-based Robinson Capital Management. &quot;We simply need for the outlook to go from awful to less bad. That's enough to see meaningful improvement in the sentiment toward most stocks.&quot;Here are seven stock picks that have earned analyst upgrades amid the market chaos. An analyst upgrade is not holy writ - it's an educated guess. But it's an educated guess by the professionals that study the companies and know their financial situation inside and out. Thus, this list is a great start-off point for investors looking to put some cash to work.

2020-04-15,"Like most stocks in this market, Coca-Cola Company (KO) stock has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. From the market peak in late February through its nadir in late march, Coca-Cola shares lost about 38% of their value. The next three weeks -- through Tuesday's close -- saw Coke shares make up about half of those losses.Still the stock is down 18% from its February 21 high. Does this make Coke stock a buy?Investment bank HSBC thinks so. In a recent report to clients, HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy argues that Coca-Cola stock is undervalued at its present price of just under $49 a share, and should fetch a price closer to $53 within a year -- assuming a few conditions are met. (To watch Laboy's track record, click here)For one thing, Laboy notes that over the past three years, Coca-Cola's profits, and its growth rate, have been bolstered by a policy of charging more for soda &quot;concentrate&quot; sold to its South American bottlers. Problem is, South America is as affected by the global pandemic as any other region, and unlikely to be able to continue paying steep price increases for concentrated sugar water. Additionally, Laboy worries that currency exchange rates between Latin American countries and the U.S. will prove unfavorable to Coke's profits, i.e. weak currencies south of the U.S. border will translate into fewer &quot;dollars&quot; earned on the income statement north of that border.So going forward, Coke is going to have to find other sources of growth.Europe, and the United States, are two places to look for such growth. As Laboy explains, bottlers in Europe and the U.S. are &quot;poised to accelerate their growth contribution [to Coca-Cola's profits] as they grow into market developers with better tools and a richer service culture.&quot; They're entering this present crisis &quot;with low debt&quot; levels and the capital they will need &quot;to accelerate investment in the Coke system,&quot; assuming Coke permits them to do so.Adding growth from Europe and the U.S., argues Laboy, to the strong businesses Coke has built in Latin America, could be the thing that pulls Coke's profits out of the $2-a-share range and pushes them higher.And yet, at the same time as he expresses this hope, Laboy seems uncertain that Coke will in fact earn more than $2. In fact, in making his projections for the next three years, Laboy projects Coke's earnings first falling from $2.11 earned last year, to just $1.73 earned this year (because of the coronavirus), and growing thereafter -- but only to $1.82 per share in 2021 and $1.93 per share in 2022.Now, will Coke's earnings be close enough to $2, though, to justify Laboy's &quot;buy&quot; rating on the stock? That depends on how much growth you demand from your investments. $2 a share, dividend into Coke's current share price of about $49, works out to a P/E ratio of 24.5. That's hardly a cheap valuation. It's especially not cheap if you assume (as Laboy does) that Coke will only grow earnings 6% year over year in 2022... and grow only 5% in 2021... and shrink earnings 18% this year.Even discounting this year's earnings drop as a pandemic-induced fluke, an earnings growth rate of 5% or 6% annually hardly seems fast enough to justify paying 24.5 times earnings. If you ask me, Coke may be &quot;the real thing&quot; -- but Coke stock is hardly a really good deal.What does the rest of the Street have to say? 13 Buy ratings and 5 Holds add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With a potential upside of nearly 13%, KO stock forecast, on average, stands at $55.24.

2020-04-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- In 1943, a group of top U.S. businessmen, calling themselves the Committee for Economic Development, began meeting in New York to discuss postwar employment. Sooner or later, they knew, legions of servicemen would be returning home in need of jobs. Forecasters were predicting that up to 30 million people could be unemployed once the war ended, which would plunge the country right back into the depression it had pulled out of only recently.To avoid that fate, economists calculated that the country needed 58 million private-sector jobs, up from 49 million in 1940. Abandoning conventional corporate wisdom, the committee embraced organized labor and called for deficit spending by the federal government. According to Rick Wartzman’s book, “The End of Loyalty,”(1)Harrison Jones, the chairman of Coca-Cola, argued that companies would need to start hiring more workers than they needed “so that the nation’s economic flywheel would begin to turn —workers becoming consumers, leading to demand for more products made by more workers.” In addition, prices would need to be low and paychecks high — even though that would obviously affect profitability.And that’s exactly what industry did when the war ended in 1945. By putting the needs of the country ahead of profits, corporate executives helped initiate one of the greatest economic expansions in history.Fast-forward to 2008. The “we’re all in this together” ethos that characterized top executives in the postwar era had been replaced by a new creed: “I’ve got mine.” Those ensconced in America’s C-suites were making millions of dollars every year  — sometimes tens of millions — while worker pay had stagnated. Shareholder value reigned supreme. Companies’ commitments to the cities in which they operated had evaporated. Shareholder activists attacked companies that weren’t ruthless enough about laying off workers or taking on debt. The needs of consumers and employees paled next to enriching shareholders.The 2008 financial crisis exemplified this attitude. Think about how banks and mortgage servicers acted when millions of homeowners were unable to afford their subprime loans. Most of the time, they foreclosed instead of trying to find a way to modify the loans so that owners could remain in their homes. American International Group, which required a $170 billion bailout from the government, insisted on paying its traders $165 million in undeserved bonuses. Small companies closed because they couldn’t obtain loans — even though the big banks had taken billions in bailout loans from the feds. New layoffs were announced seemingly every day as the U.S. suffered through the worst recession since the Great Depression.Now, of course, the world is suffering through a new crisis, one caused by a pandemic. A few weeks ago, I wrote about how the coronavirus crisis had caused the Twitterati to act more respectfully toward one another. It’s true in the physical world as well: bikers and joggers smile and wave as they pass one another; customers ask about the well-being of those who are serving them; people wait without complaint as they stand in line, 6 feet apart, for their turn to enter the grocery store. There are a hundred examples like that.When the coronavirus crisis first began, I wondered how the men and women running companies would act. Would they behave like the executives of the 1940s or like those of 2008 and 2009? So far, at least, the answer appears to be the former. The larger question is whether this change will be lasting.Let me give you two examples that crossed my radar screen recently. In their own ways, they are representative of what many companies are doing.Xerox Holdings Corp. is not one of those companies facing a grim post-crisis future. Last year, it had $1.4 billion in earnings and $1.2 billion in free cash flow. Compared with other big companies, its stock buyback program is small. And though business is undoubtedly down, the company continues to generate revenue; the health-care industry, after all, uses copiers.Xerox was onto the crisis early; it had a stay-at-home policy in place well before the federal government began urging people to self-isolate. But the Xerox brass, starting with Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, decided that it wasn’t enough to simply ride out the crisis. “We have some of the smartest scientists in the world,” Visentin told me the other day. “It was impossible to believe that we couldn’t do something for mankind.”The first thing the company did was join forces with the suit manufacturer Hickey Freeman, which like Xerox is based in Rochester, New York, to make masks for Rochester General Hospital. (It turns out that N-95 masks are made from the same material that is used in some of Xerox’s high-end printers.)Looking around for more it could do, Xerox began to focus on ventilators. It found a small company in California, Vortran Medical Technology, which makes a $120 ventilator that’s meant to be used by patients who don’t need a full-blown $20,000 intensive care ventilator. (Most Covid-19 patients fall into that category.)Xerox and Vortran struck up a partnership. Xerox has since put together a supply chain, obtained the equipment it needs to create a small ventilator plant and is devoting a portion of its factory floor near Rochester to the venture. The floor is being configured so that the workers will be 6 feet apart, and other social-distancing measures are being taken. The hope is that  Vortran and Xerox will be able to produce 150,000 to 200,000 of these disposable ventilators a month.Nobody asked Xerox to do this, which is part of the point. It saw a need — one that had nothing to do with its core business, and will never make much money — and decided to try to fill it. Hundreds of Xerox employees have been volunteering to join the project, which is another important aspect: Employees and management are aligned, something that hasn’t often been true in corporate America these past few decades.My second example is Bank of America. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Brian Chappatta noted in a column on Wednesday, the bank’s first-quarter profits were down 45%. But CEO Brian Moynihan seemed unperturbed.“Just as important as our financial results this quarter is what we are doing to take care of our teammates and to help our clients and our communities impacted by the virus,” he said at the opening of the bank’s quarterly conference call. Curious, I asked a bank spokeswoman for some more details. A half-hour later, she sent me a long list.It was impressive. For employees, the list included no layoffs in 2020 because of the coronavirus crisis; expanded benefits including no-cost coronavirus testing and $100 a day for backup child care; and a $20 an hour minimum pay rate. For customers, the bank has stopped foreclosures and allowed them to request payment deferrals on everything from auto loans to credit card late fees. There was more, including $100 million for communities to buy medical supplies and help for small businesses.When was the last time you heard a CEO tell a group of Wall Street analysts that its treatment of employees was as important as its financial results? Maybe never. How often have companies used their core resources to tackle societal challenges that will never accrue to the bottom line?That this is taking place across corporate America gives me hope. There is something about disease — and the prospect of death — that causes people to think hard about what truly matters. This may turn out to be naïve, but I believe that is happening in the executive suites of America’s big companies.Shareholder value has been an insidious force inside U.S. businesses, creating incentives that have led to selfish and callous behavior. If this crisis brings about a new set of C-suite values — or, more accurately, a return to an old set of values — then at least one good thing will have come of it.(1) The book’s full title is “The End of Loyalty: The Rise and Fall of Good Jobs in America.”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-04-20,"(Bloomberg) -- Companies around the world are pivoting away from dividends and share repurchases. Not so in Mexico, where billionaire Carlos Slim and other tycoons are dangling increased investor rewards.Slim’s America Movil SAB is asking shareholders to approve a dividend increase of 8.6% to 17 billion pesos ($711 million) this year, and boosting its buyback program. Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, parent of a convenience-store chain and a soft-drink bottler, approved a 7% increase in the total dividend payout while more than doubling buyback authorization to 17 billion pesos.The extra goodies represent a sharp contrast with the corporate scene around the world, where companies have been tightening their purse strings as they rely on government aid to survive the Covid-19 pandemic. In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to bail out companies. And with the economy plunging, investors such as Michael Reynal say they would like to see greater corporate caution.“I would tend to prefer a more conservative approach,” said Reynal, who holds Mexican stocks in his portfolio at RS Investment Management in Des Moines, Iowa. “The key issue is lack of visibility on the recovery. We sense that the pandemic has a cycle, but we have little sense of timing or duration. Biggest issue then is difficulty in forecasting, even in the near future.”Trump, AOCIn the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, businesses have scrapped more than $56 billion of dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Frowning on buybacks had united U.S. political leaders from President Donald Trump to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, even before the government’s $2 trillion economic rescue plan placed limits on the practice.Mexico’s bank and securities regulator, looking to shore up liquidity, recently urged financial institutions not to pay dividends or buybacks. But the recommendation didn’t apply to non-financial companies, many of which are controlled by family owners.Out of the 35 companies that comprise Mexico’s benchmark index, eight have already maintained or boosted their dividends for the year and only two didn’t declare one. Of the rest, 74% are likely to declare an increase, according to Bloomberg estimates. Only one company, restaurant operator Alsea SAB, is expected to omit a dividend altogether.In another major Latin American market, of the 19 Brazilian companies forecast to discuss dividends in the second quarter, eight are expected to cut or scrap dividends, including state-owned oil company Petrobras, which canceled scheduled dates to pay 1.7 billion reais in dividends ($322 million).Stock BuybacksSome Mexican companies are also sticking with buybacks. Slim’s America Movil doubled its share-repurchasing fund to 6 billion pesos, although that includes an undisclosed amount left over from last year. The telecom giant declined to comment. Separately, Slim’s foundation donated $43 million to coronavirus relief efforts.Fomento Economico Mexicano, or Femsa, declined to comment, as did Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, its soft-drink bottler. Coca-Cola Femsa boosted its buyback fund more than five fold to 5 billion pesos.Some Mexican companies are showing more restraint. Cement maker Cemex SAB said it would suspend its share buyback program to preserve liquidity. Airport operators have been hard hit by the crisis as travelers stay home, and Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB said it would postpone a dividend proposal as it works to control costs.But another airport operator, Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB, will seek approval for $95 million in dividends and propose the maximum buyback amount at an April 23 meeting. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.Shareholders at Nemak SAB, which makes auto parts, is paring its dividend but still planning to pay out about $50 million after a shareholder vote in February. The board will closely review the dividend and make a recommendation to shareholders based on current market conditions, the company said Thursday.“The company has redoubled its efforts to counter the effects of Covid-19 in the global auto industry through the optimization of costs, expenses and cash flow,” Nemak’s parent company, Alfa SAB, said in a statement. “We’re permanently monitoring market conditions and are ready to respond with new initiatives.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Slim Boosts Dividends, Buybacks With Mexico Bucking Global Trend"

Click here for more coverage of this event with options trading experts giving traders of all experience levels real, dependable strategies for hitting the ground running or expanding an existing portfolio.ProTrader Mike is the founder of trading education platform MOJO Day Trading.During the presentation, ProTrader Mike details what successful trading looks like and provides viewers with one of his favorite strategies, put selling.Selling Puts Like Buffett The key to options is understanding the concept of insurance.&quot;Buffett built his fortune with the help of insurance holdings,&quot; ProTrade Mike said. &quot;Insurers receive premiums upfront, and pay claims later.&quot;The idea behind selling options is similar to selling insurance to a counterparty. In return for taking on the contractual obligation to acquire a security at a predetermined price, the &quot;collect now, pay later&quot; model leaves option sellers with money that can be floated to new investments.ProTrader Mike details an example of selling a put on Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO).&quot;Warren Buffett determined $35 was a fair price, so he sold put options because he wanted 5 million shares. If Coca-Cola fell to $35, the option buyers -- known as the counterparty -- would put their shares to him for $35. Buffett would be forced to pay $35 a share, but he's fine with that because it's better than $39 when he first saw it. He could take a 10% discount to the current price and collect a $7.5 million in total premiums.&quot;According to Mike, put selling is one of the least complex strategies that can provide traders consistent returns as options are, in effect, overpriced insurance policies.When purchasing options, one must be correct in their assumption on direction, time and volatility, a derivative of demand for options.When the demand for an option increases, volatility and option premiums increase. However, demand for an option doesn't mean an underlying security will actually move. Instead, it's a measure of the fear that has compelled market participants to increase their buying of what inherently is insurance.As is true for most other aspects in life, fear is blown out of proportion and hence this is what happens in the options market: fear is overstated and volatility pumps premium into options, most of which expire worthless.Trading Made Easy To learn more on how to find and execute on opportunities in the options market with ProTrader Mike, click here to check out the Benzinga Options Bootcamp.Photo by Artem Beliaikin from Pexels.See more from Benzinga  * Felix Frey Says This Is How The Top 1% Trade Options  * Ross Cameron's Strategy For Using Options To Combat Market Volatility  * Smart Option Trading CEO On Gaining An Edge With Options: 'They Show The Overall Sentiment'(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

That title goes to Merck (NYSE:MRK).As noted yesterday, the energy sector is losing its pull on major domestic equity benchmarks, but in the case of the current oil environment, weight for a few energy stocks doesn't matter. Demand, or lack thereof, does. Even looking as far out as the June contract for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), traders are seeing prices as low as $12 per barrel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile the likes of Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are losing cache within equity indexes, the real issue is low prices. Not only do low prices indicate demand is all but gone for oil, they indicate producers large and small will encounter difficulty turning profits.  * 7 Real Estate Stocks to Watch as the Long-Term Impact of the Virus Looms Additionally, let me address the school of thought that low oil prices are good for the economy. If you get too low on the price chart, recession fears mount.That's exactly where markets are today, and it's unsurprising that as a result, 30 of 30 Dow stocks were lower in late trading. Same Old Song For IBMIBM (NYSE:IBM) was a Dow offender today after the company reported disappointing first-quarter results. The tech company earned $1.84 a share on revenue of $17.57 billion. Analysts expected earnings of $1.79 a share on sales of $17.62 billion.To be fair, there was positive commentary on the cloud business, but this is yet another quarter in which IBM earnings rose but revenue disappointed.

In its first-quarter earnings report, the soft drink giant said January and February were great months, but things got rocky in March and sales are declining in April.As such, Coca-Cola pulled its guidance for the rest of 2020 while making comments about the current quarter that weren't inspiring.&quot;The ultimate impact on the second quarter and full year 2020 is unknown at this time, as it will depend heavily on the duration of social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, as well as the substance and pace of macroeconomic recovery,&quot; according to the company. &quot;However, the impact to the second quarter will be material.&quot; Piling OnYesterday, I noted that analysts are starting to downgrade Disney (NYSE:DIS), though none are calling the name a &quot;sell&quot; quite yet. The stock traded lower again today after Citi Research analyst Jason Bazinet became at least the third analyst to trim a rating on Disney stock in recent days.Bazinet highlighted the strength of Disney's balance sheet and noted the dividend is probably safe, but he still took an ax to his earnings estimates on the name, going to $2.91 a share this year, down from $5.57, and to $5.18 for 2021, down from $6.14. Bottom Line on the Dow Jones TodayHeading into this earnings season, it was obvious the news was going to be mostly bad. But if a supposedly boring, steady company such as Coca-Cola is yanking guidance, that's a sign markets could be in for some more turbulence at the hands of the novel coronvirus.The problem is earnings and economic data will drive near-term returns and there's little in the way of good news to be had on either front.&quot;While coronavirus-related headlines will continue to impact the daily movements of the stock market, the longer-term trend will be driven by earnings and the economy,&quot; according to Morningstar. &quot;Investors are not only looking to analyze the depths of earnings deterioration in the near term, but more importantly they are evaluating the time frames for an economic recovery and an earnings rebound toward normalized levels.&quot;Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

Cases appear to be flattening in areas including Chicago and Boston, while New Orleans is back to its baseline for infections, Birx said at the daily White House briefing. Philadelphia, Houston, Atlanta and Nashville are also among cities improving, she said.The Washington, D.C., region is one where “we don’t see a decline yet,” Birx said. Nursing homes in rural areas are also seeing outbreaks.USNS Comfort to Leave N.Y. (6:20 a.m. HK)President Donald Trump said the Naval hospital ship the USNS Comfort will return to Virginia, where it’s based, after it was sent to New York City to supplement the health-care system and add capacity following the surge in coronavirus cases last month.Trump said at his daily press conference that he discussed the matter with in a meeting Tuesday with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who Trump said agreed to returning the ship.Trump to Ask Big Companies to Repay Aid (6:15 a.m. HK)President Donald Trump said he’ll ask larger companies to return money they accessed from the federal stimulus package because it was intended to help small businesses.Trump, speaking Tuesday at a White House press conference, criticized Harvard University’s endowment for borrowing more than $8 million through the program.“They shouldn’t have taken it,” Trump said. “And they’re going to pay back that money.”Speaking at the same press conference, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threatened “severe consequences” for those who take money from the program without meeting the criteria and fail to return it.Senate Passes Third Virus Package (5:30 p.m. NY)The U.S. Senate passed $484 billion in new pandemic relief funds Tuesday to bolster a tapped-out small business aid program, pay for coronavirus testing and help hospitals deluged by sick patients.The legislation, which the House could take up as early as Thursday, includes $320 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program designed to help struggling small businesses keep their workers on the payroll. The program has already committed all of the $350 billion allocated when it was created just weeks ago.The Paycheck Protection Program “is already helping millions of small-business employees receive paychecks instead of pink slips,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement before the voice vote.President Donald Trump said he would sign the legislation and then turn to the next round of stimulus for an economy that has ground to a halt.South Africa Sets Up Aid Package (5 p.m. NY)South Africa’s government unveiled a 500 billion rand ($26 billion) package to shore up an economy devastated by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and support those who’ve been worst affected.The plan will be funded by reprioritizing 130 billion rand of expenditure from existing budgets, and borrowing from domestic and international lenders, President Cyril Ramaphosa said Tuesday in a televised address to the nation. There will be 200 billion rand in guarantees for banks to encourage them to lend, a 100 billion-rand allocation to protect and create jobs and an additional 50 billion rand for welfare grants for the poor and unemployed, he said.“The coronavirus pandemic requires an economic response equal to the scale of the disruption it’s causing,” Ramaphosa said. “The scale of this emergency relief program is historic. It demonstrates that we will not spare any effort or any expense in our determination to support our people and protect them from harm.”South Africa has been relatively spared the worst of the ravages of the pandemic -- it’s had 3,465 infections and 58 fatalities so far. Still, a lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the disease and preventing the health system from being overwhelmed is damaging the economy, with the central bank expecting it to contract 6.1% this year.Netflix, Chipotle Gain on Lockdown (4:50 p.m. NY)Netflix Inc. added nearly twice as many subscribers as predicted in the first quarter, cementing its role as one of the rare companies to benefit from the global health crisis. Netflix added a record 15.8 million paid subscribers during the first quarter, almost double the 8.47 million forecast by Wall Street analysts. The company also clobbered its own forecast of 7 million, with droves of new customers binge-watching “Tiger King” or “Love Is Blind” to ride out the quarantine.Chipotle’s loyalty program is helping it connect with customers as digital sales grew 80%. It’s had to temporarily close about 100 restaurants, primarily those inside malls and shopping centers, as well as some locations in Europe. It withdrew its earlier guidance for the fiscal year, citing the uncertainty related to the virus. The company has enough cash on hand for over a year, so it doesn’t plan to tap the government’s Paycheck Protection Program, it said in reporting first quarter results.Treasury Has Used Half of Relief Fund (4:40 p.m. NY)The U.S. Treasury has deployed more than half of the Coronavirus Relief Fund, which provides for payments to state, local, and tribal governments.As of Monday, $81.9 billion had been used this month, according to the daily Treasury statement. The $150 billion fund was established to help lessen the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. The pandemic has crushed sources of tax revenue for states and municipalities at a time when resources, including paramedics and hospitals, are being committed to combat the threat to public health.U.S. Confirmed Cases Rise 5.7% (4 p.m. NY)U.S. cases rose 5.7% from the day before to 810,561, the biggest daily increase since April 10, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.

Deaths reached 839, an increase of 6.3%.Panel Warns on Trump-Backed Drug Combo (2:28 p.m. NY)A panel of medical experts convened by the U.S. National Institutes of Health recommended against the use of a drug combination touted by President Donald Trump for Covid-19 patients.The NIH panel, made up of 50 doctors, pharmacy experts and government researchers and officials, specifically recommended against the use of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin. The malaria pill can cause heart issues, and the NIH panel warned of the potential for harm from the combination.Trump has repeatedly backed the use of the drugs on Twitter and at numerous briefings of the Coronavirus Task Force, though some medical experts in his administration have cautioned about the lack of evidence.Netherlands to Reopen Primary Schools (2 p.m. NY)The Netherlands will reopen primary schools and daycare centers starting May 11 while all other measures constituting what Prime Minister Mark Rutte has called an “intelligent lockdown” are extended until at least May 19. The ban on mass events, including professional football, was extended until Sept. 1.French ICU Patients at Lowest in 3 Weeks (2 p.m. NY)France reported the number of patients in intensive care due to the coronavirus outbreak fell to the lowest in three weeks, while new deaths linked to the virus declined from a day earlier.Patients in intensive care dropped by 250 to 5,433, Director General for Health Jerome Salomon said in a Tuesday briefing in Paris. The number of ICU patients, which Salomon has said is an indicator of the outbreak’s impact on the country’s hospital system, fell for a 13th day to the lowest since March 30.Texas Cases Rise 38% (1:30 p.m.)Texas reported its first bump in new cases in five days, with a 38% increase to 738, according to the state’s health department. The jump came a day after testing almost doubled to more than 15,000. Total cases now stand at just under 22,000.Deaths in the Lone Star State edged higher to 22 on Tuesday, bringing the total to 517. The Houston and Dallas metropolitan areas have accounted for more than half the fatalities so far, although that is based on incomplete figures because not every death is geographically tagged in the state’s database.There are about 1,400 patients in Texas hospitals and more than 6,200 ventilators still available, according to the state.U.K. Vaccine Trials Begin Thursday (12:49 p.m. NY)The U.K. will give 40.5 million pounds ($50 million) to vaccine development projects, with human trials beginning Thursday, according to Health Secretary Matt Hancock.Of that amount, 20 million pounds will go to the University of Oxford to fund clinical trials while 20.5 million pounds will go to development projects at Imperial College London, he said.Italy Recoveries Almost Surpass New Cases (12:15 p.m.)Italy reported an almost equal number of virus recoveries and new infections on Tuesday as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte draws up a plan to cautiously extricate the country from a nationwide lockdown.There were 2,729 new cases of the disease, compared with 2,256 a day earlier, the first increase in five days, according to the civil protection agency. The number of freshly recovered patients was 2,723 over the past 24 hours, a daily record. Confirmed cases now total 183,957.Cuomo Prods U.S. for Test Supplies (12:11 p.m. NY)Hours before meeting President Donald Trump, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that while it may be states’ responsibility to organize virus testing, the federal government needs to handle international supply-chain issues.His comments address a touchy subject between the two politicians. Trump has repeatedly said that states should be in charge of the testing needed to reopen their economies. Cuomo said he plans to ask Trump to take charge of getting manufacturers to provide testing supplies and feeding them to the states, and the states can take it from there.Florida Cases Rise 3.1% as Reopening Looms (11:46 a.m. NY)Florida reported 27,495 Covid-19 cases Tuesday, up 845, or 3.1%, from a day earlier. Deaths reached 839, an increase of 6.3%.For most of April, coronavirus cases in Florida have increased at a clip of about 1,000 a day, and have shown some signs of slowing in recent days.Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has seized upon the numbers as he began holding meetings this week of his “Re-Open Florida Task Force.” Addressing the group on a conference call Monday, DeSantis said the premise of shutting down the state was to avoid overwhelming the health-care system. That has been accomplished, he said.N.Y to Allow Elective Outpatient Treatment (11:15 a.m. NY)New York state will begin allowing elective outpatient surgery in some areas as coronavirus hospitalizations level off, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday.The state will allow outpatient treatments in counties and hospitals that don’t have a significant risk of a virus surge in the near-term, mostly outside the New York City region, Cuomo said in his daily press briefing. Outpatient services won’t put any strain on hospital beds, the governors said.Deaths in New York rose 481 yesterday to 14,828 in total, while hospitalizations were basically flat, Cuomo said. The death rate has slowed over the past few weeks.U.K. Parliament Agrees to Virtual Sittings (11:06 a.m. NY)Britain’s House of Commons agreed to new rules allowing members to take part in proceedings remotely during the lockdown. The chamber, often packed because it’s too small for its 650 members, will now be restricted so only 50 people can be present at a time.Benches have been blocked off to keep those present at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart and other MPs will be able to ask questions using Zoom. Speaker Lindsay Hoyle will continue to chair proceedings from the chamber. Plans for virtual voting are still being worked up.Running of the Bulls Suspended (10:40 a.m. NY)The Spanish city of Pamplona suspended the week-long San Fermin festival set for July that includes the world famous running of the bulls.“As much as it was expected, it gives us great sadness,” the city’s acting mayor, Ana Elizalde, said in a statement, adding that it’s too early to know if the event will be rescheduled. The city’s actual mayor, Enrique Maya, is at home, recovering from COVID-19 “little by little.”As the event traditionally draws thousands of visitors from around the world, the city said it’s launching a campaign with videos to honor the tradition.Humanitarian Fund Is Short (9:22 a.m. NY)The heads of 15 international organizations, including the World Health Organization, wrote an open letter to the donor community saying a United Nations effort to raise $2 billion to help fight Covid-19 in the most vulnerable countries has so far raised only about a quarter of the goal. The World Food Programme needs more money to help pay for flights and shipments of medical supplies, and any delay may undermine efforts to control the coronavirus, the letter said.EU Set to Prolong PPE Export Curbs (9:20 a.m. NY)The European Union plans to prolong curbs on the export of personal protective equipment while narrowing the scope, EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said. The restrictions, due to lapse on Saturday after six weeks, will be extended for 30 days, Hogan told a video-conference with the European Parliament’s trade committee. The current measures require an authorization for the export outside the bloc of goods including masks, gloves and garments.Home Testing Kit Gets U.S. Approval (9:05 a.m. NY)Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings gained U.S. authorization for the first home-testing kit for Covid-19. Patients will collect samples from their noses and send them to LapCorp for testing, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement Tuesday.The kits are expected to be available in most states with a doctor’s order in the coming weeks, according to the FDA. The agency said it worked with LabCorp to ensure the tests are as accurate as those done in a doctor’s office or hospital.Pandemic Hits U.S. Earnings (9:04 a.m. NY)HCA Healthcare Inc. suspended its quarterly dividend program and withdrew its outlook.Philip Morris International Inc. abandoned its 2020 earnings guidance as the coronavirus outbreak weighs on duty-free tobacco sales, while Coca-Cola Co. said the impact of the pandemic on the second quarter will be “material.” International Business Machines Corp. shares fell after the company reported a drop in first-quarter revenue and pulled its full-year earnings outlook.A UBS model suggests that U.S. companies’ earnings-per-share estimates for the next 12 months could be slashed by almost 15% in the coming eight weeks.Schumer Says Aid Deal Reached; White House Says It’s Close (9:03 a.m. NY)Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday his party’s congressional leaders and the Trump administration reached a tentative deal on an emergency economic rescue package that will replenish a tapped-out small business aid program and provide money for coronavirus testing and overwhelmed hospitals.An administration official said Tuesday the sides were “very close” to a deal. A Senate Republican aide said no agreement had been reached yet.U.K. May Post ‘Modest Contraction’ in First Quarter: Haldane (8:46 a.m. NY)Economic figures for the first half of the year will probably be “very ugly,” Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said in a podcast with the Institute for Government. He said the second quarter will show a sharper contraction, and those patterns will be replicated across the world.Separately, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, told reporters on Tuesday that the government is standing by its testing target. At the beginning of April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock had pledged to get the daily testing rate up to 100,000. While capacity is now closing in on 40,000, a fourfold increase since the start of the month, finding people to test is proving more problematic.“Clearly we need to make sure that that capacity is being used and that’s what we’re working on,” Slack said.Netherlands New Cases Fall to Lowest Since March 23 (8:12 a.m. NY)The Netherlands reported 729 new cases, the least in nearly a month, bringing the total up 2% to 34,134. Deaths rose by 4% to 3,916, while reported hospital admissions increased 1%, the RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment said in its daily update.Prime Minister Mark Rutte will announce late Tuesday whether lockdown measures in the country will be relaxed.EU Health Commissioner Urges Caution (7:20 a.m. NY)Governments in the European Union mustn’t be complacent even if the number of infections is stabilizing, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said, urging caution in easing lockdown measures. Quick, uncoordinated exits risk jeopardizing the sacrifices of citizens and medical staff, she told members of the European Parliament’s health committee.The EU is also boosting efforts to develop a vaccine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will host an online pledging conference on May 4 to help fill funding gaps and mobilize investment necessary for research into effective therapeutics.In a video-conference with his counterparts from Germany and Austria, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis called on neighbouring countries and the EU to proceed in a coordinated manner to ease restrictions as quickly as possible, according to a statement by the Bern-based government on TuesdayVirus May Only Be a ‘Blip’ in German Mortality Rate (6:40 a.m. NY)The new coronavirus will barely cause a “blip” in German mortality statistics if the country is able to keep its spread under control as well as it is now, the country’s public-health authority said.“If we continue to control the virus as well as is currently the case, then we probably will barely see the effect on total deaths,” said Lars Schaade, vice president of the Robert Koch Institute. “This is different in other countries with a very large number of cases.” Schaade warned against complacency, saying Germans must keep up their guard until a vaccine is found. Some 95,200 people in Germany have recovered from the virus, more than any other nation, while 4,862 have died.More European Countries Ease Lockdowns (6:20 a.m. NY)Serbia eased one of Europe’s strictest coronavirus lockdown regimes, allowing small businesses to reopen and relaxing a daily curfew that had kept most citizens indoors since mid-March. In Croatia, citizens can now move within their county of residence and Slovenia opened some businesses on Monday, while Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will next week provide details on a plan for a return to normalcy.Oil Meltdown Spreads Beyond Expiring Contracts (6 a.m. NY)The meltdown in oil markets widened, with huge losses spreading beyond contracts affected by technical anomalies as the world runs out of places to store unwanted crude. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery plunged below zero on Monday for the first time in history, but the panic selling spread to the June contract on Tuesday, which briefly dropped as much as 42% to $11.79 a barrel.The widening of the price collapse to futures that aren’t close to expiry underscored the severity of the crisis in the oil market. Storage tanks, pipelines and tankers are rapidly being overwhelmed by a vast oversupply caused by slumping fuel demand as countries are locked down to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Earlier, Brent crude futures dropped below $20 a barrel, the lowest since 2002.(A previous version corrected the spelling of Pamplona)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",U.S. Cases Rise 5.7% as Trump to Pause Immigration: Virus Update
2020-04-21,"Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) saw its global volumes fall 25% since the start of April which marks a complete reversal from prior trends, CNBC's Sara Eisen reported Tuesday.Coca-Cola reported first-quarter earnings of 51 cents per share, which beat consensus estimate by 7 cents. Revenue of $8.6 billion beat the $8.28 billion estimate.What HappenedCoca-Cola's global volumes were higher by 3% through February (excluding China) but then &quot;fell off a cliff,&quot; Eisen said after chatting with CEO James Quincey. The CEO said at least half of its beverage business is sold to channels away from home and growth in the at-home category isn't large enough to offset losses elsewhere in the business.Ironically, some categories that were experiencing secular declines prior to the coronavirus outbreak are now rebounding, she said. One example is more consumers eating breakfast at home, which supports a jump in demand for Coca-Cola's Simply Orange Juice.Why It's ImportantCoca-Cola saw &quot;absurdly strong&quot; levels of growth as consumers stockpiled their cupboards with beverages but tapered off in the past few weeks. Quincey attributed the loss of momentum to consumers coming to realize the economic outlook is not so great, Eisen said.&quot;They are already seeing that sort-of recession mindset impact spending -- people in the U.S. especially,&quot; she said.View more earnings on KOQuincey told Eisen the company's decision to scrap its 2020 outlook is due to multiple unknowns ahead.

2020-04-21,The beverage company did not provide full year guidance Continue reading...,Coca-Cola Surpasses 1st-Quarter Earnings and Revenue Projections
2020-04-21,"Coca-Cola Co. (KO) warned on Tuesday that the coronavirus-related acceleration of global social distancing regulations along with lockdown orders are poised to have a “material impact” on its second-quarter results.Since the start of April, the beverage maker’s global volume has dropped 25%, it said. In addition, in view of the uncertainty of the development of the coronavirus pandemic, the company decided to withdraw its full-year financial guidance.“The ultimate impact on the second quarter and full year 2020 is unknown at this time, as it will depend heavily on the duration of social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, as well as the substance and pace of macroeconomic recovery,” Coca-Cola said in a statement. “However, the impact to the second quarter will be material.”Coca-Cola also reported first-quarter results with earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis amounting to 51 cents and above analysts’ estimates of about 44 cents. Revenue dropped 1% to $8.6 billion beating analysts’ estimates of about $8.3 billion.Until the end of February, Coca-Cola said that it still saw volume growth of 3%, excluding China, and was on track to achieve its previously provided full-year 2020 targets. However, in March as more and more countries implemented social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates in response to the fast spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the beverage company experienced substantial declines as restaurants, movie theatres and other out-of-home channels were shut down. Offsetting the change in consumer behavior, Coca-Cola saw increased demand in home supplies along with a sharp increase in e-commerce.To meet the demand, the company is increasing investments in e-commerce to support both retailers and meal delivery services, shifting toward package sizes that are fit for online sales, and redeploying consumer and trade promotions toward digital ones. At this point, Coca-Cola said it did not expect material disruptions in goods production or distribution.Wall Street analysts Keven Grundy at Jefferies and Dara Mohsenian at Morgan Stanley, who view Coca-Cola stock as a Hold, today raised their price targets from $46 to $48 and $49 respectively. Shares fell 3.2% to $46.53 on Monday in U.S. trading.However, the rest of the analyst community has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the company’s stock based on 13 Buys and 5 Holds. The $56 average price target is more aggressive than Jefferies and Morgan Stanley as it implies 20% upside potential in the coming year. Coco-Cola updated investors that cash from operations declined 29% to $556 million. Free cash flow on a non-GAAP basis fell 43% to $229 million, due to the impact of one less day in the quarter, currency headwinds and other factors.Related News:  United Airlines Expects $2.1 Billion Quarterly Loss as Travel Stalls  IBM Beats Quarterly Profit Estimates, Suspends 2020 Guidance  Philip Morris Releases Strong Q1 Results; Warns That Worse Is To Come More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Daimler Sees 70% Drop in First-Quarter Earnings, Suspends 2020 Guidance   * Boeing Sued by Kuwaiti Aviation Over $336 Million 737 MAX Jet Order   * O’Reilly Auto Reports Better-Than-Feared Q1 Earnings; Shares Up 3%   * Quest Diagnostics Beats Quarterly Earnings But Pulls 2020 Outlook",Coca-Cola Sees Coronavirus Impact to Be ‘Material’ in Q2; Slashes 2020 Guidance

2020-04-21,"With nearly half of all global sporting events cancelled or postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Coca-Cola is anticipating a 'significant' hit to second quarter sales.","Coca-Cola Tops Q1 Earnings Forecast, Pulls 2020 Profit Guidance"
2020-04-21,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. said the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has made it impossible to predict what 2020 holds, although it warned that the effect on the second quarter will be “material.”Volume, which is closely tracked by beverage companies to gauge demand, has declined about 25% globally since the start of April, the beverage giant said in its earnings statement Tuesday. The effects of social-distancing measures and lockdowns have hurt sales primarily outside the home, as stadiums and entertainment centers, where the company gets about half of its revenue, remain closed. The ultimate impact on full-year results will depend on the duration of those measures, Coke said.Earnings per share and organic revenue, which strips out currency effects, outpaced analyst expectations in the first quarter. Coke shares fell as much as 4.9% on Tuesday. The stock has declined almost 20% this year.While the ultimate impact can’t be predicted, Coke said it “believes the pressure on the business is temporary and remains optimistic on seeing sequential improvement in the back half of 2020.”The company said it saw “early pantry loading” in certain markets as stay-home measures were put into place, but grocery shopping then returned to normal levels. E-commerce, however, sharply increased.Soft drink volumes fell 2% in the first quarter, with China driving the trend, the company said. The Asian nation was the first to lock down its economy as Covid-19 spread rapidly, killing thousands. China’s virus measures also hurt juice sales in the period, which fell 6%.Coke is a big sponsor for sporting events and has a long-standing partnership with the Olympics. Now, with these events closed for the foreseeable future, the company said it’s prioritizing flexibility.“It’s going to be difficult,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said on a call with investors. The Olympics, which were set to take place in Tokyo this year but are now postponed, present the biggest challenge, he said.The majority of the company’s investment in the Olympics is in media and marketing, which will happen closer to the event, and so Quincey said the company has some flexibility in its commitments.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Coca-Cola Says Covid-19 Impact on Second Quarter to Be ‘Material’

2020-04-22,"What makes a &quot;blue chip&quot; company? The well-established and financially-sound companies in the stock market that are the leaders, the advocates and representatives of an entire industry. Their attributes are that they are safe, stable, profitable, and long-lasting companies and this is why they are considered as relatively safe, low volatility investments.Due to their historical posting of steady earnings results year after year, blue chip companies are generally considered to be safer investments because of their ability to generate profits even during an economic downturn.But this was before COVID-19, which caused some of the &quot;safest&quot; stocks on the market to trade at massive discounts. I believe, however, that some of these companies are in a prime position to not just survive, but bounce back better thane ever once this crisis is behind us. DisneyWalt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) shares are cheap for good reason, as the things that made its business model so successful are what made it impossible to protect the company from the pandemic. The stock is trading 32% below its 52-week highs and the next several quarters will be incredibly rocky due to plunging revenues, unpredictable earnings, and so much uncertainty. But Disney will survive and it still has Bob Iger to count on as its executive chairman.The legendary House of Mouse ensured $7 billion of senior debt to smooth over daily cash flow damages as it is losing $30 million per day. And there still could be even lower buy-in price points as its theme parks and cruises are on lockdown and production around the world is halted. But investors know that Disney will reward them, and the company should be able to hit the ground running as soon as it's allowed to lace up those running shoes again. But until then, a 30% discount on this top-shelf stock is surely a rare scenario that can't help but feel like a good deal.Coca ColaCoca-Cola (NYSE: KO) also added some debt cash to its balance sheet last month. But unlike Disney, Coca-Cola continues to generate substantial revenues even during these dark times as a consumer staple.Coca-Cola has also differentiated itself from Disney in its unwavering commitment to strong dividend payments as it has boosted its annual payouts without fail in each of the last 57 years. But even if we consider the worst scenario since this is a unique situation the world has never found itself in, Coke's board of directors could free up another $6.9 billions of annual cash flows if they break the trend and pause their dividend policy. But that's highly unlikely to happen, and this 20% discount is a unique opportunity to entitle yourself to Coke's 3.4% effective dividend yield. Just like Disney, Coca-Cola is sure to land on its feet when the economy and living in general restart.General Motors Auto factories in the U.S. won't be opening any time soon. Like its peers, General Motors (NYSE: GM) shut down its plants in mid-March. And no one knows when will those factories reopen as the situation is being evaluated week to week. Along with negotiating with UAW, it is also in discussion with Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU) working on a plan to restart production while protecting workers. It may be months before things go back to normal. GM already survived a worker strike last year, and one that was the longest in 50 years. GM is been relatively silent, yet, it has assured its investors that it's in better financial shape its rivals, at least for now. The company that once was the world's largest motor-vehicle manufacturers has disclosed that it has drawn down its credit lines but has not suspended its dividend (unlike Ford). Is it a &quot;fake it until you make it&quot; strategy or confidence in the balance sheet? I believe it's the latter. COVID-19 Has Redefined Blue ChipsA blue-chip company is considered to be a leading company in its sector as its final products or service is dominant in the market. Such a company is seen as relatively impervious to economic downturns, but there is no company that was unaffected by this unprecedented health crisis that has put half of the world's population in lockdown.Even Big Tech such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) suffered immense supply chain disruptions when China was on lockdown, not to mention the effect on revenue due to store closures. Going forward, the new heroes will be the companies that will be able to survive this pause and quickly resume their operations once things restart. And if the companies above have anything in common, it is the reputation of withstanding the test of time.Other Opportunities Outside Of The Blue ChipsAside from the blue chips, I'm also bullish on renewable energy. Oil companies are collapsing but the future of solar is bright. Though many solar companies are struggling at the moment, use of solar power is still expanding. The U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory recently achieved a record in solar efficiency, reaching 39.2% efficiency for solar cells under unconcentrated solar conditions and as much as 47.1% using concentrated light.As far as specific companies, SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ: SPWR), a designer and manufacturer of silicon photovoltaic cells, recently announced an expansion into New England, where it is slated to deliver approximately 11 MW of direct current solar power.Meanwhile, JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. (NYSE: JKS) announced total solar module shipments for FY 2019 of 14.3 GW in March, within its guidance range and up 25.6% year-over-year. Moreover, there are innovative companies that are combining this sophisticated technology to change even other industries and our lives for the better. One example is Franchise Holdings International's (OTC: FNHI) Worksport, which made solar technology accessible and combined it with the auto industry with its TerraVis patent. This pioneering company is soon to launch the world's first solar-powered tonneau covers, which will breathe in new life to any pickup truck.With solar costs continuously falling, it's no longer unlikely to imagine a future where almost everything will be powered by the sun.Of course, the damage that the COVID-19 outbreak has made to the economy has taken a toll on this industry. But over the long run, I believe that this sector should be well positioned.This article is not a press release and is contributed by Ivana Popovic who is a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-04-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Just about every investor has heard the adage “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Many have probably traded accordingly. In the bond markets, it’s starting to look as if the strategy was to buy when the Federal Reserve revealed its plans to prop up companies’ debt, then pare back as the central bank prepares to take action.The corporate bond market reacted with nothing short of euphoria each time the Fed unveiled how it would go about backstopping debt from U.S. companies. The largest exchange-traded fund tracking the investment-grade market, known by its ticker LQD, surged 7.4% on March 23, the biggest gain in more than a decade. That was the day the Fed announced the terms in which it would wade into credit markets to an unprecedented degree. LQD popped an additional 4.7% on April 9, when the central bank expanded its program to include “fallen angels” and even junk-bond ETFs. The largest high-yield bond ETF (ticker: HYG) benefited the most, jumping by 6.6%, the most since January 2009.Something strange has happened since then: Neither HYG nor LQD have climbed back to their April 9 levels.Now, part of that can be explained by investors bidding up those ETFs to huge premiums relative to the underlying assets. But that can’t justify the moves of the past week, when prices were aligned with net asset values. While the S&P 500 Index has jumped 4.6% since April 21, LQD is down 0.1% and HYG is up just 0.6%. The same is true of the Bloomberg Barclays indexes tracking the investment-grade and high-yield debt markets. The fading rally also can’t be blamed on a supply-demand imbalance. In the two weeks from April 9 to April 22, investment-grade funds experienced about $8 billion of inflows and high-yield funds added $9.9 billion, according to Refinitiv Lipper data. Even with more companies flocking to the now-open primary market with new offerings, investors have met them with a larger pile of cash. Average yield levels and spreads have barely budged for two weeks.All of this suggests that the Fed simply announcing its corporate credit backstop was enough to swing open the market’s doors and get creditors and lenders back to the table. Or, to borrow words from a Bloomberg News headline this week, the central bank “is already bailing out levered companies.” But it raises questions about whether the facilities will meaningfully lift debt prices once they’re fully operational. In other words, it might be that the central bank’s thought counts just as much — if not more — than actually executing its plans.Indeed, markets are just now discovering some of the more cumbersome and confusing aspects of the Fed’s programs. Bloomberg News’s Erik Schatzker and Craig Torres reported on Tuesday that the stimulus bill to combat the coronavirus pandemic included wording that was “deliberately vague” and “may leave out hundreds of companies with far-flung operations, including Coca-Cola Co., General Electric Co. and Mastercard Inc. No one knows for sure.”Here’s a bit more:The situation is creating headaches for Fed officials at a time when the central bank is playing a critical role preventing the Covid-19 outbreak from crushing the economy, people familiar with the matter said. In practical terms, restricting what it can and can’t do means the Fed might not be to supply all the liquidity needed to prop up prices if there’s another meltdown in credit markets....Also hamstrung is BlackRock Inc., the investment firm retained to manage the corporate lending and bond-buying facilities. Fed officials and BlackRock executives are working out how to execute the program under the legislative constraints, the people said, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issues.Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have a chance to address some of these concerns at his press conference Wednesday after the central bank’s meeting. As of now, all that’s known is the credit facilities are supposed to “go live” in the next few weeks, per an April 17 speech from New York Fed Executive Vice President Daleep Singh.For now, here’s where markets stand: The average corporate bond yields 2.75%, or about 207 basis points more than benchmark Treasuries. On March 20, that yield was 4.58%, or 373 basis points more than Treasuries. Heading into this year, the average spread was less than half the current level, at 93 basis points. High-yield debt yields 774 basis points more than Treasuries, down from as high as 1,100 basis points last month but up from 315 basis points in January.The question for bond investors is whether spreads will further compress as the Fed starts buying. In theory, of course, the answer is yes — a large, price-insensitive buyer is stepping in with up to $750 billion of firepower. But U.S. companies are staring down a crisis that’s unprecedented in any number of ways, and they are just beginning to look ahead to an economic reopening that could be equally as perilous. At best, it will be a slow grind tighter, not hundreds of basis points in less than three weeks.Some money managers have already voiced their views. Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital’s Chief Investment Officer, this week called LQD “the most overvalued asset in the bond market.” The ETF reached as high as $132 on April 9, not far from its record level of $134.53 on March 6. It now stands at $129.20.With so many questions about the path forward, it’s understandable why investors took comfort in knowing the Fed will support the debt markets as companies, governments and individuals muddle their way through in the coming months. But they should be wary of blindly following the central bank. The chance to do so may have already passed, before the Fed bought a single corporate bond.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-04-29,"Shares of the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) are up 4% this week, as investors have reflected on a strong start to 2020 despite a global pandemic.Excluding asset impairment charges and other items, Coca-Cola reported adjusted first-quarter earnings of $0.51 per share on revenues that dropped 1% to $8.60 billion. This resulted in a net income of $2.78 billion, or $0.64 per share. The closure of cinemas, restaurants, bars and stadiums due to measures of social distancing is hurting Coca Cola business. Though about half of Coca Cola's revenue comes from home-consumption, this blow cannot be amortized with the stockpiling people are getting while on lockdown. An even more significant impact is expected on its second-quarter results.  Post-COVID-19 Era - E-commerce, Cost Cuts, And SustainabilityThe company's e-commerce growth rate did double in many countries, but unfortunately, this still remains a relatively small part of Coca-Cola's overall business. The company is cutting costs wherever possible, and this includes its generous marketing spending. It has no plans to cut its dividend, but don't expect any acquisitions this year or stock repurchases.When we look towards the future of Coca-Cola, we can see a company that is focused on healthier options and sustainable initiatives, such as reducing plastic waste. But the company has survived for over 100 years on the back of its time-tested formula of sugary sodas, and it's still too early to tell whether these new products can become a long-term driver of growth for the company.  In the meantime, it's good to see that Coca-Cola was still able to grow its earnings and revenues on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. COVID-19 or not, Coca-Cola will continue to a dominant consumer staple.

2020-04-30,"The seasonal suggestion to ""sell in May and go away,"" an adage spurred by the market's superior performance during certain months of the year, is backed by the numbers more often than not. But whether investors should follow that advice is an annual debate - one that's a lot more complex this year.""The data shows that, on average, the November-April periods outperformed the May-October periods,"" says Jodie Gunzberg, chief investment strategist at Graystone Consulting, a Morgan Stanley business. Gunzberg points to monthly S&P; 500 data compiled from January 1928 through March 2020, which shows an average November-April return of 5.1%, versus just 2.1% for May-October.A few other numbers to consider:  * The November-April period delivered positive returns in 65 of 91 years (71%).  * The May-October period delivered positive returns in 60 of 92 years (65%).  * During positive periods, the average November-April return was 11%, versus 8.7% for May-October.  * During negative periods, the average November-April return was -9.6%, versus -10.4% for May-October.Regardless, market strategists and financial experts typically advise investors to avoid timing the market. And this is no ordinary year, as the COVID-19 pandemic has unfurled a global economic slowdown and a frenetic couple months of market action.Let's take a holistic look at the ""sell in May and go away"" phenomenon as it applies to 2020. Here, we'll explore what the experts think about the current economic environment, whether the strategy works for investors, their broader investing suggestions right now and which areas of the market they favor.

2020-05-03,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) reported an almost $50 billion loss in the first quarter as the value of its stock holdings portfolio was hit hard by the coronavirus-induced capital market sell-off.    Berkshire’s first-quarter net loss amounted to $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share compared with a $21.66 billion profit, or $13,209 per share during the same period last year. Incurred investment loss on stocks and other investments amounted to $54.52 billion as the S&P 500 Index plunged 20% in the first quarter.     “As efforts to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated in the second half of March and continued through April, most of our businesses were negatively affected, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe,” the company said in a regulatory filing on Saturday.    Berkshire reported $6.1 billion of net equities sales in April compared with the $1.8 billion of net stock purchases it made the first three months of the year. The proceeds from these activities have been primarily reinvested in U.S. Treasury Bills, the company said. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock in the first quarter.    The investment conglomerate has stakes in financial firms including Bank of America (BAC) and American Express (AXP) and other major conglomerates ranging from Apple Inc. (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO) to Kraft Heinz (KHC).    “Several of our businesses deemed essential have continued to operate, including our railroad, utilities and energy, insurance and certain of our manufacturing, distribution and service businesses. However, revenues of these businesses have slowed considerably in April,"" Berkshire said. “Other businesses, including several of our retailing businesses and certain manufacturing and service businesses are being severely impacted due to closures of facilities where crowds can gather, such as retail stores, restaurants, and entertainment venues.""    Berkshire owns 26.6% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC). The stock has plunged as much as 37% in the first quarter and closed at $29.38 in U.S. trading on Friday.     Wall Street analysts have a Hold consensus rating on the company’s stock based on 14 Holds, 2 Buys and 1 Sell. The $30.41 average price target indicates a mere 3.5% upside potential in the coming year.

2020-05-15,"The novel coronavirus has hit Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) particularly hard. With a rally off March lows fading, Anheuser-Busch stock now is down more than half so far in 2020.Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com It's a more stunning decline than an investor might think. Excluding travel, financials and retailers, BUD has been the worst large-cap stock of 2020.And it's not as if Anheuser-Busch stock roared into the year. Shares did post a nice rally in 2019 -- but off a six-year low reached the prior December. Heading into 2020, BUD still was nearly 40% below 2016 levels.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are both short- and long-term reasons for the selling pressure. But before last week's earnings report, I argued that Anheuser-Busch stock was a buy if it retested March lows. We're getting close to those lows. At this point, and after earnings, I believe Anheuser-Busch stock is a buy. A Short-Term HitUnquestionably, Anheuser-Busch is taking a short-term hit from coronavirus-driven fears. As I noted earlier this month, the company is getting a boost in off-premise (takeaway) sales. Data from Nielsen showed a nearly 10% increase over four weeks.  * 20 Stocks to Buy If You're Still Betting on America to Thrive Of course, the off-premise business is getting slammed worldwide. Bars, restaurants, stadiums and other venues are closed. Sales have fallen so far that there are legitimate concerns about how brewers will dispose of stale beer.The impact was seen in BUD's first-quarter report last week. Revenue declined 5.8% for the quarter. But volume actually was up 1.9% in the first two months. Given higher pricing, revenue grew even faster.Indeed, revenue per hectoliter rose nearly 4% in the quarter. That suggests that revenue in January and February was up close to 6% -- while March sales fell in the range of 25%. The news for April was worse: a 32% decline in global volume.Unsurprisingly, adjusted earnings (what Anheuser-Busch calls ""underlying profit"") fell 30% year-over-year in Q1. The second quarter will be worse. The problem with the brewing industry is that costs don't come down all that much along with volume. The brewery still needs to operate; labor savings are minimal. Even gross margins fall when volumes come down.And so this crisis in 2020 is a multibillion-dollar problem for Anheuser-Busch. There's no two ways about it. Longer-Term WorriesAgain, that comes after Anheuser-Busch stock already had its struggles. The rise of craft beer worldwide created literally thousands of new competitors. The number of breweries in the U.S. alone almost doubled between 2014 and 2018.As a result, sales for BUD and other mega-brewers have stalled out. Indeed, Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) has seen its stock fall even further, and its shares are retesting an 11-year low.In addition to the pressure on the industry, Anheuser-Busch's acquisition of SABMiller put tens of billions of dollars in debt on the balance sheet. So, it's not a surprise that BUD stock struggled even before the current crisis. The Case for Anheuser-Busch Stock at the LowsAll that said, price matters. Value matters.And I'd keep this in mind: Anheuser-Busch stock has lost a stunning $65 billion in market value so far in 2020.Again, the short-term hit is significant in terms of lost sales and profits. But it's not $65 billion significant. It's nothing close to that.And as far as the long-term impact goes, I'm skeptical it's all that negative. Normalcy will return. Bars and restaurants already are starting to reopen, if cautiously so.Many craft competitors unfortunately won't do the same. What we're seeing in sectors like tech is a realization that size and scale are enormous benefits in a time of turmoil. Anheuser-Busch has that size and scale.Elsewhere in the beverage industry, investors seem to have that understanding. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) estimated a global volume decline of 25% for the first three weeks of April. Its stock is down just 21% this year, a performance some thirty points better than that of BUD.Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is another consumer giant with heavy leverage. Its shares are down 10% YTD. Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM) stock actually has soared, and sits at an all-time high.To be sure, I'm not arguing that BUD stock should be positive amid the crisis. I'm not even convinced that Anheuser-Busch stock should be tracking Coke.But, again, outside of the hardest-hit sectors, BUD has been the worst large-cap stock of 2020. I simply don't think the long-term outlook supports that kind of decline.

2020-05-15,"While lots of uncertainties remain for Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), a FaceTime meeting with CFO John Murphy revealed that the food and beverage conglomerate expects performance to bottom in the second quarter, according to Credit Suisse.The Coca-Cola Analyst Kaumil Gajrawala maintained an Outperform rating on Coca-Cola with a $57 price target. The Coca-Cola Thesis Coca-Cola's performance may improve after the second quarter, with improving trends at quick service restaurants and better bottler commentary regarding May, Gajrawala said in a Thursday note. (See his track record here.)Countries that were impacted by COVID-19 earlier are already improving, and the U.S. economy is reopening, the analyst said. These trends also support the expectation of the second quarter being a trough for the company, he said. The CFO indicated that Coca-Cola's focus is on increasing efficiency while remaining consumer-centric, Gajrawala said, adding that companies will embrace technology to revise processes and cost structures.With consumers being forced to stay home, the company ""expects to increase emphasis on affordability in emerging markets and less experimentation with small brands,"" the analyst said. Coca-Cola will need to decide on where to invest and which bottlers and markets to be involved with, he said.Referring to the liquidity situation, Gajrawala said the company had two debt issuances in March and April of a total of $12 billion, which will help prepare for the worst.KO Price Action Shares of Coca-Cola were higher by 0.92% at $44.10 at the time of publication Friday.

2020-05-19,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With the coronavirus pandemic turning the world’s economy upside down, analysts and investors have a lot of questions, and companies are doing their best to answer them. So if it feels like earnings calls were extra long these past few weeks, that’s because they were. Among the 29 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average who normally have earnings calls and have held one since the beginning of March, 22 companies ran longer than usual by an average of about 10 minutes.Johnson & Johnson executives were the most verbose, with the company’s April 14 earnings call stretching about 1 hour and 43 minutes. That was nearly 26 minutes longer than the average of Johnson & Johnson’s previous four earnings calls. Even Walmart Inc., which doesn’t consistently hold public earnings calls, held an hour-long one on Tuesday to discuss first-quarter results. Analysts are generally grateful to have the extra information, but they, too, are noticing the longer calls. “Sorry, I was just fixing myself some dinner,” joked JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Steve Tusa in the middle of Emerson Electric Co.’s April 21 earnings call, which took place in the morning but stretched on a bit. “This is a pretty comprehensive conference call you’re having here.” Emerson, which isn’t a member of the Dow, included presentations by its major business heads as well as the CEO, CFO and company president. All told, the call lasted more than 2 hours, about 45 minutes longer than the recent average. It’s probably wise to stockpile snacks ahead of the next round of calls in July. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brooke Sutherland is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies.

2020-05-21,"When it comes to investing in dividend stocks, it's patience that results in the real payday for shareholders.The most obvious measure of a company's income potential, its dividend yield, is calculated on an annualized basis using 12 months of distributions. That typically is spread across four payments, with one dividend paid out each quarter, meaning you can hold a stock for about 12 weeks without seeing a penny in dividends if you wind up selling at an inopportune time.Beyond the simple practicalities of making sure you're eligible for the next dividend, the real reason patience pays for income investors is the dramatic lift dividends provide over the very long term. Consider that the S&P; 500 Index of large U.S. stocks is up 167% since the beginning of 2010. However, if you account for the dividends paid out by the constituent stocks in this benchmark and reinvest that cash back into the index, your return jumps to more than 230% over the past 10 years or so!If this is the performance that dividends can deliver across a decade, imagine what happens when you account for a century or more of payouts.These 13 dividend stocks have provided just that: a rich history of uninterrupted cash distributions to shareholders stretching back at least 100 years.

2020-05-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The IPO market just got a shot of caffeine from JDE Peet’s BV. Don’t expect other consumer listings to get such a rush.The owner of Peet’s Coffee, Douwe Egberts, Kenco and Tassimo on Friday priced shares in its initial public offering at 31.50 euros, in the upper half of the offering range, valuing the company at 15.6 billion euros ($17.3 billion), and rose to about 35.50 in mid-morning trading.The biggest European IPO this year, pulled off in a swift 10 days, is a remarkable feat for a consumer business in the midst of a pandemic and a looming global recession. But JDE Peet’s has been uncannily well-placed to capitalize on changing consumer habits during lockdown, the prospects for reopening and a resurgence in equity markets. The Dutch company was floated by JAB Holding Co., the investment fund backed by Germany’s billionaire Reimann family. Cornerstone investors, including funds run by George Soros’s firm, had agreed to take up a third of the offering, setting the tone.In a world crowded with coffee chains, JDE Peet’s gets 80% of its sales from coffee that is drunk at home. That meant it benefited as corner cafes shuttered and people working from home were forced to become their own baristas. Now that they can start going out again, it’s ready to serve them their favorite hot beverage too at the Peet’s Coffee chain. And just as Nestle SA benefited from people looking to stock up on the Starbucks-branded coffee it sells in supermarkets, so JDE Peet’s may gain new customers at its cafes if they discovered its products in the grocery store during lockdown. As consumers navigate post-lockdown life, JDE Peet’s looks well insulated. That may explain why the valuation, as of mid-morning trading, is approaching that of Starbucks Corp. on a calendar 2019 enterprise-value-to-Ebitda basis.  With consumers likely pulling in their purse strings, homemade coffee may be more popular than pricey takeaway lattes. Yet the valuation may also reflect optimism about reopening, and expectations that people will be eager to get out and about. Early indications from U.S. retailers, such as discount-chain owner TJX Cos Inc. and even department store Macy’s Inc., are that sales have been stronger than expected since Americans were able to shop in person once again.And let’s not forget about the IPO timing with stock markets gaining from their lows in March. That may be one reason why Peet’s was so keen on an accelerated book build: to avoid any sudden market turbulence.The fortunate confluence of factors may not come together for other consumer-facing groups looking to float or spin off a division. L Brands Inc.’s desire to eventually separate its Victoria’s Secret lingerie chain comes to mind. It was grappling with a tired image and too many stores even before the Covid-19 outbreak.As for Peet’s, the successful float leaves it with firepower for further acquisitions. It plans to use the proceeds to cut debt — it aims to reduce the leverage ratio from 3.6 times to below 3 times by the end of the first half of 2021 — but it gets an acquisition currency in the form of equity.Competition for coffee assets has been intense. There was a flurry of deals two years ago with JAB’s $2 billion purchase of Pret A Manger, which sells coffee as well as food to go; Coca-Cola Co.’s $5.1 billion swoop on Costa Coffee; and Nestle’s $7 billion deal for the rights to sell Starbucks coffee in supermarkets.But JDE Peet’s could get lucky here, too, particularly in the market for drinking coffee outside the home. With the lockdown-induced distress in malls and on main streets, it may be able to grab something to go for a better price.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-06-11,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the coronavirus pandemic continues, Bloomberg Opinion will be running a series of features by our columnists that consider the long-term consequences of the crisis. This column is part of a package on how the pandemic is altering the business of eating and drinking.  For more, see Bobby Ghosh on the future of destination dining, Adam Minter on how sanitized street food will hurt the world’s poor and James Gibney’s interview with Daniel Okrent and Wayne Curtis on the future of bars and cocktails.At a time when most food producers are facing disruption, Ethan Brown is high on the hog. Well, the hogless hog. Brown is the founder and CEO of Beyond Meat, a protein company that sells plant-based meat products — burgers, sausages, ground “beef” and fried “chicken” — to U.S. retail stores, including Target and Whole Foods, and major food chains worldwide, such as KFC, Carl’s Jr., Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks.Following a funding windfall from investors including Bill Gates and Tyson Foods, Beyond Meat went public in May 2019. Its stock price quadrupled by July 2019, hitting $234 per share at its height before tumbling to $75 in January 2020 and now sitting at $128. Despite the swings in valuation, the company’s earnings climbed 140%, from $40 million in first-quarter 2019 to $97 million in the first quarter of this year. When the pandemic hit, earnings more than doubled. I spoke with Brown at his office in Los Angeles about how he’s keeping pace with the demand, and how climate change and Covid-19 have spurred trends in ethical eating. Here’s a lightly edited transcript of our exchange.Amanda Little: Describe the growth at Beyond Meat and what’s been driving it.Ethan Brown: We are seeing a few trends at once that are advantageous: More households are buying more of our products, more often and in more retail outlets. We’ve also more than doubled our food service penetration. While we skew a little toward retail, 42% of our sales are now in food service. And we’re seeing strong international growth: We’re in 75 countries worldwide, and international sales jumped nearly 5,000% from last year.What’s driving it? First and foremost, consumer health concerns associated with animal protein. There was a World Health Organization analysis in 2015 and a number of university studies since that have highlighted the carcinogenic and cardiovascular risks associated with red and processed meats. There’s also increasing public awareness of animal welfare and growing concern about climate change and natural resources. Our burgers have a fraction of the environmental impact — using 99% less water, 90% lower greenhouse gas emissions, 93% less land and about half the energy required to produce beef from an animal. AL: What has happened to your growth since early March, when Covid-19 began to hit hard in the U.S.?EB: Our retail sales were up 233% for the four-week period ending March 22, 2020, outperforming the plant-based meat category as a whole, which rose 93%. What I did not anticipate was the disruptive pricing that would occur in the animal-protein market this year. We’ve seen significant run-ups in the wholesale and retail costs of beef in a short period of time.AL: Your products are still quite a bit more expensive than conventional meats.EB: Yes. We set a goal over a year ago to underprice animal protein within five years. Because of progress and the recent price spikes in meat, we’re much closer to the goal. Of course, they’ll be able to moderate the price of animal meats somewhat, but we now know the vulnerability of the system. It’s a crucial moment. There’s no question that we’ll be able to underprice animal protein. Instead of feeding plants to cows for 18 months or to pigs for six months, we’re taking the protein right from the plant in a matter of minutes, restructuring that protein to the form of animal muscle. We should be cheaper than animal meats, and we will be.AL: How will you maintain this growth after the pandemic? EB: Our household penetration in the U.S. is still only at 4%. So even with this growth we're just scratching the surface. In retail, we only have eight stock keeping units (individual products); we should, and will one day, have dozens of SKUs. We also feel good about our long-term prospects in food service. Take the U.S. market as an example — there are some 650,000 restaurants. We are in less than 10% of them. So, in both retail and domestic food service, there’s lots of room for growth. And then, of course, there are international markets. We very much view this as the beginning of our growth. AL: Walk me through the logistical challenges of this rapid growth. How are you keeping pace with demand? EB: I feel very equipped to deal with this growth — it’s as if we’ve been waiting and preparing for this moment. That’s reflected in the hiring on our executive team. For example, Sanjay Shah, our COO, who joined eight months ago, had been at Amazon where he managed significant growth at North American fulfillment centers. He has deep experience in scaling and operating high-growth businesses. My chief growth officer is from Coca-Cola. The examples go on and on. We’ve also made significant investments in production facilities here and in Europe.AL: What’s your take on the recent swings in your stock valuation?EB: I don’t comment on short-term stock valuation.AL: Your competitor, Impossible Foods, built its brand in restaurants and fast-food chains, whereas you built your brand first in retail. That’s been a notable advantage during the pandemic.EB: It has. We actually began by selling in food service — mainly hospitals and universities in the Mid-Atlantic along with the prepared foods section at Whole Foods — and when we tried to expand to restaurants, we failed at first. So we maintained our focus on retail while we tried to make more progress in the restaurant space, and ultimately our success in retail — we’re now in 25,000 U.S. stores — drove our success in food service. It was important to me to build our brand and products in dialogue with the consumer. When we first started selling in Whole Foods stores, I spent a lot of time talking to consumers who were sampling or buying our products in and around Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, often off the beaten path and in smaller markets. You learn a tremendous amount from the consumer about what they want in a product — simple plant-based ingredients and nothing genetically modified — when you just are willing to listen to them.AL: There’s been a backlash against plant-based meats — consumer concerns that the products are highly processed and unhealthy. How are you addressing this?EB: There are well-financed camps [in the conventional meat industry] that continue to feed the confusion. Here’s the thing: We are really proud of the ingredients we use, the process we use, so it’s not like we’re scratching our heads, thinking, “How do we spin this?” We source our proteins, fats, minerals and carbohydrates directly from plants — with no GMOs, nothing artificial and less saturated fat. Our ingredient list is longer because we have to list the component parts of making our meat — sources of our amino acids, fats and vitamins. We don’t have luxury of just writing “beef.” We’re doing a lot of outreach to customers to educate them on our ingredients. I have also said that consumers are more than welcome to stop by our facilities in Missouri and see how the food is made. I stand by that. It seems like a basic right, no?AL: Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown has said by 2035 we’ll see the end of animal meat. Do you agree? EB: I don’t share that perspective. I would say: I don’t know. It’s all up to the consumer. If we get the products to be indistinguishable from animal protein, we provide nutritional advantage — more protein, more iron, no cholesterol, lower saturated fats, and if we drop the price below animal protein, it becomes in my view a minority of consumers that says, “I just don't want to eat this.” But I don’t see the need to be adversarial. It’s a distraction, a red herring, to make it us versus them.AL: Is it reasonable to compare this moment in plant-based meats to the birth of tech industries — I’m thinking cell phones in the mid-1990s — which faced volatility at the outset but then became ingrained?EB: Think about the earliest computers and how big and expensive they were. Density and cost curves improved them and enabled mass adoption, just like with mobile phones. We’re on a similar trajectory: Our products and platforms are getting better, and our costs will over time decline as we scale. For us, the path to mass accessibility centers on taste, nutrition and cost. The convergence of improved quality (taste and nutrition) and competitive pricing on the one hand, and these powerful trends in consumer behavior on the other, create a powerful moment for change. AL: Going forward, things will get harder for livestock producers. The pandemic has been devastating for many and climate change will put increasing pressure on their operations. EB: I think a lot about how many American farmers are hurting. The digital revolution over the last 30 years did very little to benefit the family farmer. We have a technology and approach that can empower farmers to make more money growing protein-rich plants and help bring economic prosperity back to rural America.(Clarifies findings of universities' studies in fifth paragraph. )This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Amanda Little is a professor of journalism and science writing at Vanderbilt University.

2020-06-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. shares tumbled Friday after Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it will halt all U.S. advertising on both platforms, fueling concerns that other major consumer brands may follow suit.Unilever, which owns names like Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Axe shower gel and has an annual advertising budget of almost $8 billion, said it won’t advertise on Facebook, Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram for the rest of the year because of the hate speech and polarized politics that users often post.“Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,” Unilever said in an emailed statement. “We will be monitoring ongoing and will revisit our current position if necessary.”Facebook shares extended a decline after the news. The stock had dropped 4.6% earlier Friday, then fell 8.3% to $216.08 at the close. Twitter shares dropped 7.4% to $29.05.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism about misinformation on the site, announcing the company would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub, and expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech for in advertising.Unilever’s decision follows similar moves by a growing list of high-profile consumer companies, including outdoor gear company Patagonia and Verizon Communications Inc., which claim that technology platforms -- particularly Facebook -- profit off user posts that promote hate and spread misinformation.A consortium of civil rights and other advocacy groups, including Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, have called on advertisers to stop spending on Facebook-owned platforms for the month of July to protest the company’s policies. Honda Motor Co.’s U.S. unit said Friday that it would join the boycott and halt advertising on Facebook and Instagram in July. Unilever’s commitment extends that pledge through 2020, and adds rival social network Twitter to the mix, which has also struggled to deal with offensive posts but has recently taken a more active stance than Facebook in some cases related to U.S. President Donald Trump.More brands joined the fray as the day wore on. Coca-Cola Co. said it will pause paid advertising on all social media for at least 30 days. Hershey Co. intends to halt Facebook spending in July, according to Business Insider.So far, the boycott organizers say that more than 100 companies are participating.“We invest billions of dollars each year to keep our community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update our policies,” a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that the company has banned 250 White supremacist organizations from its platforms. “We know we have more work to do, and we’ll continue to work with civil rights groups, GARM, and other experts to develop even more tools, technology and policies to continue this fight.”Facebook has had a rocky relationship with civil rights groups for years, which have fought to diversify Facebook’s board of directors, accused the company of enabling voter suppression tactics, and took issue with Facebook’s decision to name the Daily Caller, a right-wing news outlet with ties to white nationalism, as one of its formal fact-checking partners in 2019.Frustrations were renewed after Zuckerberg said that a series of posts from Trump about race-related protests were not a violation of the company’s rules. In one last month, Trump said that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” a post that was flagged on Twitter as a violation but not on Facebook. A number of unhappy Facebook employees staged a walkout to protest the decision.As the boycott has grown over the past week, Facebook has been reaching out to advertisers to share details about the company’s existing policies, and its efforts to automate the flagging and removal of hate speech on its service. It’s also been highlighting its work to increase voter registration, and on Friday Zuckerberg said the company would now prohibit ads that target certain races or ethnic groups as dangerous. In an email to marketers this week, the company said that it bases its policies on principles, not business interests.Twitter, which has not been the target of the formal ad boycott but has faced similar criticisms as Facebook over the years, says that Unilever reached out to alert the company of its decision before making the announcement publicly.“Our mission is to serve the public conversation and ensure Twitter is a place where people can make human connections, seek and receive authentic and credible information, and express themselves freely and safely,” said Sarah Personette, Twitter’s vice president of global client solutions, in a statement. “We are respectful of our partners’ decisions and will continue to work and communicate closely with them during this time.”(Updates with Coca-Cola and Hershey in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Facebook, Twitter Tumble on Unilever’s Social-Media Pullback"

2020-06-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Critics of Facebook Inc. who have assailed the social network as failing to adequately police hateful and misleading content on its service found a powerful ally Friday: Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would stop spending money with Facebook’s properties this year.The decision by the maker of major consumer goods like Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise to follow other brands in an advertising boycott, prompted a rare reaction from Facebook’s investors. Shares plunged 8.3% on the news, eliminating $56 billion in market value. Unilever’s pledge applies immediate pressure on other big companies and presents a risk to Facebook’s dominant business. Later Friday, Coca-Cola Co. said it would pause ads on all social media platforms for at least 30 days, while Honda Motor Co.’s U.S. unit, Hershey Co. and several smaller brands said they would join the boycott.Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg attempted to address advertiser concerns in a live question-and-answer session with employees Friday, announcing a handful of minor changes to the company’s ad and content policies. But his remarks didn’t go far enough for critics.The Anti-Defamation League, among the collection of civil rights groups that organized the July ad boycott, called the changes announced by Zuckerberg “small.”“We have been down this road before with Facebook,” the group said in a statement. “They have made apologies in the past. They have taken meager steps after each catastrophe where their platform played a part. But this has to end now.”The social network has been less aggressive than competitors Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. in responding to what employees and advertisers say are harmful posts from U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as incendiary content that goes viral. Facebook, of these companies, is also the most susceptible to regulatory risk, and is already facing antitrust investigations from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.“You can continuously see the challenge of them trying to have these kinds of broad principles around free expression and stopping harm, and then that mixing with the realpolitik of trying to keep the executive branch happy, which happens to have a half dozen investigations open of Silicon Valley companies for a variety of reasons,” Alex Stamos, a former Facebook security executive, said this week at the virtual Collision Conference.The regulatory threats have historically seemed to loom larger for Facebook than advertiser concerns. The company accounts for about 23% of the entire U.S. digital advertising market, according to EMarketer. And it dominates social media with more than 3 billion users of all its properties.For years, Facebook has weathered scandals with its business intact and growing rapidly. The company’s advertising revenue gained 27% in 2019 to more than $69.7 billion despite threats of regulation, previous calls for advertising boycotts and a user movement encouraging people around the world to delete their accounts. But just four months before the U.S. election, and amid nationwide protests about race and policing in society, Facebook finds itself at the cultural center of a divided country, balancing regulatory pressures with societal ones.Facebook already warned that advertisers are spending less as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, businesses are under pressure to cut costs and respond to the public’s concerns about racial injustice in society. When the civil rights groups organized the ad boycott to push Facebook to better combat hate speech, companies saw a way to make a political statement at an economically convenient time.“It is clear that Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, are no longer simply negligent, but in fact, complacent in the spread of misinformation, despite the irreversible damage to our democracy,” Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP said in a statement last week.Facebook has tried to quell the boycott behind the scenes, and has reached out to advertisers to push back on the narrative that it doesn’t care about fighting hate and misinformation. In an email to advertising partners, the company highlighted the software it uses to detect hate speech, which has improved over the years, and its efforts to circulate verified information around the elections with a new informational hub and a goal to register 4 million new voters.During the Q&A with employees, Zuckerberg went a step further. He said the company will put a link to the voting hub on all posts related to voting, and will also start marking posts that violate Facebook’s rules, although the posts will remain up if they’re newsworthy.Those rules give Facebook cover to take an action without making a decision on the nature of the content. For instance, several weeks ago when Trump tweeted that mail-in voting would lead to fraud, Twitter labeled the post to fact-check it. Zuckerberg left the same post alone on Facebook. But now, if all voting-related posts have a context link on them, the CEO won’t have to make controversial decisions about their accuracy.Facebook, which already prohibits advertising that discriminates, also sharpened those policies Friday with a clause saying no ads will be allowed if they label another demographic as dangerous, or if they portray immigrants, migrant groups or refugees as inferior and worthy of disgust. “There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.In a follow-up email to advertisers late Friday, Carolyn Everson, vice president of global marketing solutions, summarized the announcements Zuckerberg made and outlined many of the steps the company already takes to find and remove hate speech. Everson added that Facebook will seek an audit for its quarterly report outlining how it enforces its community standards.“Hate is an insidious feature of every society, and that is reflected across all platforms,” she wrote. “But we also believe in our responsibility to help change the trajectory of hate speech -- and while we know we can’t eradicate it, we will continue to do everything in our power to shatter its presence on our platform.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Facebook Ad Boycott Sinks Stock, Raises Pressure on Zuckerberg"

2020-06-28,"(Bloomberg) -- A growing list of Facebook Inc.’s advertisers is set to halt spending on social media, undermining the company’s sales outlook and putting its stock price under further pressure.Starbucks Corp., Levi Strauss & Co., PepsiCo Inc. and Diageo Plc were among the most recent companies to say they’re curtailing ad spending, part of an exodus aimed at pushing Facebook and its peers to suppress posts that glorify violence, divide and disinform the public, and promote racism and discrimination.No single company can significantly dent growth at Facebook, which generated $17.7 billion in revenue last quarter alone. But a rising tally adds to pressure on other brands to follow suit, and when combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook deepens.“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”As more brands publicize plans to join boycotts or otherwise rein in ad spending, Facebook shares remain under pressure. The stock tumbled 8.3% Friday after Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would halt spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion. Shares closed at $216.08 Friday after reaching a record $242.24 the preceding Tuesday.Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner noted in an April earnings call the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll-back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in marketing spending. Facebook will eke out 1% revenue growth in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, according to analysts’ current projections, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.Starbucks said Sunday that it would pause spending on all social media platforms while it carries out talks internally, with media partners and civil rights groups “in the effort to stop the spread of hate speech.”Trump PostsWhile some companies are targeting social media generally, including Twitter Inc., many are singling out Facebook specifically. Zuckerberg has been more reticent to put limits on discourse, notably controversial posts by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying that he doesn’t want Facebook to be an arbiter of what’s true.That’s prompted a consortium of civil rights and other advocacy groups, including Color of Change and the Anti-Defamation League, to urge advertisers to stop spending on Facebook-owned platforms for July to protest the company’s policies.Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism, saying that Facebook would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub. The social network also expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech for advertising.“We understand people want to put pressure on Facebook to do more,” Facebook vice president Nick Clegg said Sunday on CNN’s Reliable Sources. “That’s why we made those additional announcements in Friday. That’s why we’ll continue to redouble our efforts, because, you know, we have a zero tolerance approach to hate speech.”The Anti-Defamation League called the changes “small.”The stampede of advertisers, combined with lobbying from civil rights groups, leaves Zuckerberg in a bind. He could take further steps to curtail harmful content, but that risks alienating free-speech advocates and supporters of Trump who have argued that Facebook is censoring political discourse and suppressing conservative voices.Distinct ExodusHe could also stand pat on a bet that this advertising pause will be short-lived, as have social media ad boycotts in the past. But this exodus as distinct, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil rights groups, he said. “The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”Will Zuckerberg budge? While major brands like Unilever and Coca-Cola have garnered most of the headlines, the vast majority of Facebook’s 8 million advertisers are small businesses, many of which rely heavily on Facebook advertising for sales. Some in the ad industry don’t believe that these businesses, particularly those in commerce and direct-to-consumer sales, can actually afford to halt spending.“Pulling off for a whole month would really hurt their business,” Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said earlier this week. “It’s a lot to ask for.”In its outreach to advertisers last week, Facebook has said it doesn’t intend to make decisions based on sales. “We have been consistent that we do not make policy changes tied to revenue pressure,” Facebook said on Wednesday in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. “We set our policies based on principles rather than business interests.”Whatever additional moves Facebook makes, there’s reason to believe the departure of advertisers won’t end soon. “Advertisers who have seen their own ads published against hateful, horrible content on Facebook -- racist, anti-Semitic poison -- they are finally saying ‘enough’,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Our phones have been ringing off the hook with advertisers. I can tell you more are coming.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook’s Growing Ad Exodus Means More Risks to Revenue Growth

2020-06-29,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. fielded criticism from a growing number of consumer companies over harmful content on its sites, with Starbucks Corp. and Diageo Plc pulling back on ad spending and General Motors Co. planning to review its social media marketing strategy.Starbucks and Diageo followed Unilever, Coca-Cola Co. and several other companies in saying they will cut ad spending, part of an exodus aimed at pushing Facebook and its peers to limit hate speech and posts that divide and misinform. Microsoft Corp., which was Facebook’s third-largest advertiser last year, has paused global ad spending on the site because of concerns about ads appearing next to inappropriate content, according to a person familiar with the matter. The list of companies taking similar action lengthened on Monday. Britvic Plc, which supplies a wide range of soft drinks, Patreon Inc. and The Clorox Co. all said they will stop advertising on Facebook while GM said it’s “reviewing and reinforcing” its marketing guidelines.Read more: How to Go Cold Turkey on $77 Billion of Facebook Ads: Alex WebbWhile a single advertiser can do little to hurt a company that generated $17.7 billion in revenue last quarter, the rising tally creates peer pressure on other brands, and civil rights groups say they expect more corporations to join a boycott. Combined with a pandemic-fueled economic slowdown, the threat to Facebook is deepening.“Given the amount of noise this is drawing, this will have significant impact to Facebook’s business,” Wedbush Securities analyst Bradley Gastwirth wrote in a research note. “Facebook needs to address this issue quickly and effectively in order to stop advertising exits from potentially spiraling out of control.”Shares gained 2.1% Monday to close at $220.64 in New York, after dropping 8.3% on Friday. Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, said it would cease spending on Facebook properties this year, eliminating $56 billion in market value and shaving the net worth of Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg by more than $7 billion.Facebook was already bracing for weakness in the second quarter, which ends this week. Chief Financial Officer Dave Wehner said in an April earnings call that he saw the “potential for an even more severe advertising industry contraction.”The number of coronavirus cases has surged in the intervening months, prompting many parts of the country to slow or roll back reopening efforts and giving advertisers added justification to rein in spending. Facebook’s sales will rise 1% in the June period, followed by a 7% increase in the third quarter, analysts predict, by far the smallest quarterly growth increases since the company went public.Advertiser boycotts in July could cost Facebook more than $250 million in the third quarter if 25% of its top 100 buyers pause spending, and as much as $500 million if 50% of the top advertisers stop, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral.Zuckerberg announced changes Friday designed to appease critics, but the Anti-Defamation League, one of the groups calling for the boycott, called the amendments “small.”Some analysts have said the financial impact of recent exits will be limited, citing past advertiser revolts. Even so, this exodus is distinct in key ways, Bernstein Securities analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a research note Saturday. There’s heightened pressure to publicly demonstrate that brands stand with civil-rights groups, he said.“The current environment is very different,” Shmulik wrote. “It is very visible who is and isn’t participating in the boycott where brand silence [equals] being complicit.”(Updates to add Microsoft withdrawl in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Facebook Sales at Risk as Starbucks Bails, GM Plans Review"
2020-06-29,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Mark Zuckerberg has a problem, and he can fix it.Public furor over Facebook Inc.’s content policies has led some of its biggest advertisers to take action, with brands from Starbucks Corp. to Unilever, Coca-Cola Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. all vowing to pull ads from the social media giant’s namesake Facebook platform as well as Instagram for at least the month of July. The move was initially spurred by a campaign led by a coalition of civil rights groups — including the Anti-Defamation League and NAACP — to force Facebook to do more to curb hate speech and language promoting violence. As the effort has gained traction, the numbers joining the boycott are increasing on a daily basis. On Monday afternoon alone, Best Buy Co. said it would pause its ad spending on Facebook, while Axios reported that Microsoft Corp. had suspended its advertising as well.Facebook has come in for criticism about its practices before and got past it largely by riding out the negative publicity while offering some incremental fixes. For example, Facebook already survived the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal a couple years ago without serious long-term ramifications. And so, Zuckerberg may be tempted to hunker down this time as well.On a purely short-term financial basis, it would make sense. According to Pathmatics data, the top 50 advertisers on Facebook accounted for just 4% of the company’s sales last year. The vast majority of the rest comes from millions of small- and medium-sized businesses that are less affected by any public shaming from activists, and arguably more reliant on the exposure they get from buying ads on Facebook and Instagram. But a decision based purely on dollars and cents would be short-sighted in this instance, and bad for business.More and more, it’s becoming clear that the recent wave of protests over racial injustice isn’t a short-lived phenomenon, but one that appears to reflect a sea-change in perception and beliefs, and — like the MeToo movement before it — demands a change in behavior. The backlash that started at the grassroots level and moved on to corporate action is likely to move next to the political and regulatory sphere. Wouldn’t it be better for Facebook, already in the public glare, to bend and make its own meaningful policy changes instead of being forced to accept more punitive prescriptions and further potential damage to its reputation and business?Facebook is already facing increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. Politicians from both sides of the aisle have made proposals to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields internet companies from legal liability over user-generated content. For now, Republicans and the Department of Justice are focused on issues of conservative speech censorship, while Democrats have asked for the faster removal of misinformation and false claims inside political ads.The disparate points of emphasis likely means nothing will happen in Congress before the November election. However, if one party controls both houses of Congress and the White House next year, the probability of regulation will rise considerably.In the near term, the risk for Facebook may be greater from Europe than the U.S. The region’s authorities have identified antitrust as the more effective way to tackle Silicon Valley’s shortcomings than regulation, whose limits have been exposed by the General Data Protection Regulation that kicked in two years ago. GDPR has done little either to change the business practices of Google or Facebook, or to reduce their market power. And discussions about data or content are always questions of regulation, rather than antitrust.But antitrust is far more of an existential threat to Facebook than is regulation. That’s not simply because it could, in the most extreme circumstances, result in a breakup of the company. It’s because antitrust by definition seeks to tackle its business practices.Just last week, Germany’s highest civil court ruled that Facebook must stop logging browsing activity outside of its platforms without users’ explicit permission, and that such permission couldn’t be a condition of using its other services. Crucially, though, the decision was based not on data protection but antitrust laws. It said Facebook was abusing its market power to force users to accept the terms because it is the dominant social network. And the ruling fundamentally attacked the company’s business model, which is built on using such data to target ads effectively. An effort by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority is even less ambiguous: It’s carrying out a study into online platforms and digital advertising.While the U.K. is no longer a member of the European Union, the bloc’s regulators are following the findings of the study closely. After years of tackling Google, Facebook is now high on the European agenda. The two firms’ dominance of digital advertising is fueled by their low incremental costs. Tackle their business models, and you might resolve the harmful content problem, runs the argument. The EU plans new rules by the end of the year on content regulation and platform liability, while Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s antitrust and tech chief, is seeking new powers to break companies up. And the European Commission has more power than U.S. regulators: It can impose decisions unilaterally, which companies can then challenge in court. In the U.S., regulators generally need court approval first before any ruling is imposed.So, Zuckerberg needs to acknowledge the growing uproar is symptomatic of new and lasting societal, political and regulatory crosscurrents. While he has long been adamant it is not Facebook’s job to be the “arbiter of truth,” there is no better climate, in the face of pressure from advertisers, politicians and civil rights groups alike, to alter that stance — he can change tack without losing as much face.Serious changes are needed — from being more effective in taking down hate speech quickly  to clamping down on false claims and disinformation from all users. Such moves would help the company get ahead of future actions from regulators. That would be wise as government regulation will likely be far more punitive – whether it be from the European Union or a potentially new American administration.Simply, Facebook’s traditional hands-off approach isn’t good enough anymore. It’s time for Zuckerberg to show some real leadership.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

2020-06-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg took the unusual step on Friday of publicly broadcasting a weekly Q&A with employees. Over a live video feed, the CEO announced a series of updates to Facebook’s policies around hate speech -- the central topic fueling a growing boycott of Facebook advertising.But the new policies, like labeling posts from public figures who break its terms of service, didn’t assuage critics. The coalition of civil rights groups organizing the boycott called the announcement “a small number of small changes.” Demands like adding a high-ranking executive focused on civil rights, providing face-to-face customer service for hate speech victims and removing extra protections for elected leaders were still unmet.And, though it wasn’t officially included on their public list of proposed changes, the boycott organizers also have a more fundamental complaint: Zuckerberg has too much control.“Mark Zuckerberg has way too much power for a company of this size and reach,” said Arisha Hatch, vice president and chief of campaigns at Color of Change, one of the boycott’s organizers. “He is the one that is blocking progress in this moment.”Zuckerberg, who famously co-founded Facebook as a student before dropping out of Harvard University, has always been the most important person at the company, partly thanks to his out-sized control of its board. Recently, he has consolidated even more power. Since 2018 the founders of Facebook’s other properties, like Instagram and WhatsApp, have left the company, giving Zuckerberg more say over its product empire. And a number of board members -- including former Gates Foundation CEO Susan Desmond-Hellmann and former American Express Co. CEO Kenneth Chenault -- departed in the past two years, many of them over frustrations with Facebook’s corporate governance, according to the Wall Street Journal.For some, the lack of dissenting voices within and around Facebook is worrying. “This behemoth of a company, that’s operating more as a public utility, must be more accountable,” said NAACP CEO and boycott organizer Derrick Johnson.Zuckerberg is not the only important executive at the company. He has long relied on Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to run Facebook’s business and policy divisions, and he has a number of top executives who advise him. But unlike Twitter Inc., which goes out of its way to say that CEO Jack Dorsey does not make content decisions, Zuckerberg is clearly the final say on all things Facebook.“The way decisions escalate in Facebook are very much what you’d expect in any complex organization where there was a hierarchy,” Nick Clegg, the company’s vice president for global affairs and communications, told reporters earlier this month. “For the most difficult decisions, there’s one ultimate decision maker, our CEO and Chair and Founder, Mark Zuckerberg.”As Facebook’s advertising boycott has grown to include household names like Starbucks Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and Unilever, the social network has fought back with an information campaign intended to demonstrate how much the company already does to fight hate online. Facebook has repeated a series of statistics in interviews and in emails to advertising partners, including that the company detects 90% of the hate speech it removes from the platform before any user even flags it.The company has also been touting a voting information campaign announced earlier this month with the goal of registering 4 million new U.S. voters before the 2020 presidential election. On Friday, Facebook said it would arrange a third-party audit of its quarterly report detailing how much content it takes down for rules violations.But so far, the piecemeal changes have done little to placate the company’s critics. “It’s unclear what the perfect solution is,” said Mark Shmulik, an analyst at Bernstein Securities. “There’s no kind of silver bullet here to fix it -- it’s a very broad, ambiguous problem.”On the larger issues, Facebook has shown little sign of relenting. Diminishing Zuckerberg’s control over the company is almost entirely out of the question. Repeated shareholder proposals to change Facebook’s voting structure or replace Zuckerberg as chairman have failed to clear the company’s board because Zuckerberg himself has voted against them -- the CEO has almost 60% of the vote thanks to a special class of shares unavailable to public investors. The arrangement has raised the question of who, specifically, Zuckerberg is accountable to.“This is where you have a runaway train,” the NAACP’s Johnson said on Monday on Bloomberg Television. “And that runaway train is causing harm to the public and it’s causing harm to our democracy.”The group calling for a Facebook boycott has several demands around removing hateful content that could prove difficult for the company to adhere to. Facebook said it’s already doing the best it can to find and remove posts promoting hate. In an interview on Bloomberg Television Monday, Clegg said Facebook does not profit off hate speech, and that it had an “industry-leading record” when it came to dealing with issues related to the “dark side of the internet.”But Clegg added: “I don’t want to pretend this is an easy straightforward task, that there is a switch we can flick and all hate speech suddenly disappears.”Hate has always been a problem for open platforms, in part because it’s difficult to define. In some cases, a post that clearly appears to be a rules violation to some people, is considered allowable by others. This dynamic played out late last month after a series of posts from President Trump struck many as a clear threat of violence. However, Zuckerberg said the posts were not actually a violation of Facebook’s policies. The posts remained up and untouched, even though Twitter flagged the same language.At Color of Change, Hatch understands that the social network, with more than 2 billion monthly users, probably cannot remove hate speech entirely, but she believes Facebook can do more within its current structure. “Certainly when things are flagged they need to be removed, and certainly when things are coming from the current president or an elected official, it needs to be removed,” Hatch said.Even though the boycott has trimmed billions off Facebook’s market capitalization, it’s not clear how much influence advertisers will have over the company’s processes. Some of the participating companies are heavy spenders, including Starbucks and Unilever, who together spent more than $30 million on Facebook ads during the first six months of the year, according to Pathmatics, a digital marketing analytics company. However, that’s a small amount compared with the almost $35 billion in sales Facebook is projected to report for the same six-month period.The vast majority of the company’s advertisers are small businesses, not name-brand marketers. Smaller companies rely on Facebook’s direct response ads, which drive specific outcomes like a website visit or an app install. Facebook’s top 100 advertisers accounted for roughly $4.2 billion in sales revenue last year, Pathmatics estimates, or just 6% of all Facebook revenue. So far, only a handful of the company’s 100 top-spending advertisers from 2019 are pulling money from Facebook ads.“As important as these advertisers are to Facebook, it would likely take a far broader advertising boycott over a longer period of time to materially impact Facebook’s ad revenue,” Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analysts wrote Monday in a note to investors. Facebook stock ended the day Monday up 2.1% despite the new additions to the ad holdout.Facebook will have more opportunities to try to alleviate concern this week in a series of meetings, including a round table discussion with advertisers and Facebook executives on Tuesday. Color of Change would also like to meet with Facebook this week -- but the group is holding out unless Zuckerberg also attends, a spokesperson said. It’s possible that the boycott, which is formally running through July, could extend further depending on how Facebook responds, Hatch said.“It’s definitely a live, dynamic campaign,” she said. “We’re hopeful we won’t have to make any further adjustments or asks. But that’s up to Facebook really.”(Updates with details on Color of Change meeting in 21st paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Critics Target One Thing CEO Won’t Cede: Control

2020-07-06,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you’re not clear on Environmental, Social and Governance investing, you’re not alone. The Department of Labor appears to be just as confused. Luckily, Facebook Inc. may serve as an example to help clarify the burgeoning investing movement. The Labor Department issued a proposed rule recently that is being widely interpreted as a ban on ESG investing in retirement accounts. A news release said the rule “is intended to provide clear regulatory guideposts” for corporate pensions and 401(k) plans around ESG investing. What it’s actually doing, however, is sowing utter confusion.  “Private employer-sponsored retirement plans are not vehicles for furthering social goals or policy objectives that are not in the financial interest of the plan,” Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia said. But ESG has nothing to do with furthering social goals or policy objectives. By definition, ESG investing is strictly a financial endeavor, an attempt to improve the performance of portfolios by limiting their exposure to companies whose environmental, social or governance policies, or lack of them, are deemed risky. In that regard, it’s no different from striking a balance between stocks and bonds, investment-grade bonds and junk, stocks of large and small companies, or any number of decisions investors routinely make to manage risk and attempt to boost risk-adjusted returns. Consider Facebook. The social media behemoth has problems. A growing number of big corporate advertisers such as Coca-Cola Co., Starbucks Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are pulling their ads, fearing they might appear alongside hate speech, misinformation and other divisive content routinely posted on the platform. Facebook also faces a slew of antitrust inquiries from Congress, the Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general, as well as increasing bipartisan calls to remove legal protections that limit the company’s liability over content posted by users. Complaints about Facebook aren’t new. There have been widespread concerns about how the company handles user data since at least 2018, when news surfaced that Cambridge Analytica had obtained personal data of up to 87 million users. But Facebook has largely ignored its critics, mainly because co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg controls the company and doesn’t appear to share the concerns, at least not enough to do anything meaningful about them. So far, Zuckerberg has made mostly symbolic gestures, such as rolling out a new voter information hub and agreeing to meet with civil rights groups who organized the advertising boycott. Zuckerberg no doubt prefers to wield absolute power, but it’s a risky proposition for Facebook’s shareholders. There is growing evidence that companies with strong governance generally perform better and are less likely to fail than those with weak governance, which also makes them a less volatile and better-performing investment over time. The best ones have policies that hold management accountable and balance the competing demands of shareholders, creditors, workers, suppliers, customers and regulators. Suffice it to say, while Zuckerberg is on the throne, Facebook has few of those checks and balances.That’s a problem because Zuckerberg is the sole arbiter of what is and isn’t a hazard for Facebook, even if all indications are to the contrary. And clearly, not everyone at the company agrees with Zuckerberg’s sanguine outlook. Facebook employees recently staged a virtual walkout, and some senior figures publicly expressed their disapproval of Zuckerberg’s laissez-faire approach to policing content. If there were a greater diversity of opinion in Facebook’s decision-making process, perhaps it would have been more attune to the many threats it now faces.    The risk posed by Facebook’s strongman governance is the “G” in ESG. Not surprisingly, Facebook receives poor marks for governance. Institutional Shareholder Services, a leading provider of ESG ratings, gives Facebook a 10 for governance, the highest risk score on its 10-point scale. And according to various governance metrics tracked by Bloomberg, such as percentage of independent directors and board size, governance has weakened at Facebook over the last decade. For investors worried about the governance risk around Facebook, reducing their exposure to the company, or even eliminating it entirely, is a reasonable financial move — one that is consistent with, in fact prescribed by, the Labor Department’s “longstanding position” that retirement plans “select investments and investment courses of action based on financial considerations relevant to the risk-adjusted economic value of a particular investment.” It’s also the essence of ESG.Scalia and the Labor Department appear to confuse ESG with what would more accurately be called socially responsible investing, or SRI, which attempts to align investors’ portfolios with their values by excluding companies and industries that conflict with those values, regardless of financial impact. It’s no less odd that the Labor Department wants to ban SRI. While I suspect SRI investors will pay a price for mixing their money and their values, there’s little evidence so far that SRI is a drag on portfolios or that it would undermine the “retirement security of American workers,” as Scalia seems to fear. So if 401(k) participants and pension beneficiaries want their money aligned with their conscience, it’s not clear why the Labor Department should stand in the way, particularly when it’s part of an administration that professes devotion to deregulation, small government and religious freedom. But at the very least, the Labor Department should clarify that it’s targeting SRI, not ESG.If the rule stands, one silver lining is that it might promote a clearer separation between ESG and SRI, which would help investors navigate the growing social investing landscape. Funds that blend the two are a particular source of confusion. The iShares ESG MSCI USA ETF, for example, both invests in stocks with strong ESG scores and excludes tobacco and weapons companies. The Labor Department’s proposed rule would presumably disqualify it from inclusion in retirement plans, and thereby discourage more funds from mixing ESG and SRI.  However the rule shakes out, one thing should be clear: When ESG takes issue with companies such as Facebook, it’s about money, not values. If the Labor Department finds that confusing, imagine how ordinary investors must feel.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the markets.

2020-07-07,"(Bloomberg) -- Civil rights organizations criticized Facebook Inc. following a meeting with top executives Tuesday, claiming the company hasn’t taken seriously demands to better police its service from hate speech and misinformation.“Facebook approached our meeting today like it was nothing more than a PR exercise,” Jessica González, co-chief executive officer of Free Press, a non-profit media advocacy group, said in a statement following the meeting. “I’m deeply disappointed that Facebook still refuses to hold itself accountable to its users, its advertisers and society at large.”Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg also met with members of the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League and Color of Change, who have organized a boycott of the company’s advertising products in seeking to prompt change. The executives didn’t “commit to a timeline” to remove disinformation and hate speech, Gonzalez said, but instead “delivered the same old talking points to try to placate us without meeting our demands.”“The meeting we just left was a disappointment,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, on a call with reporters.The forum, which lasted about an hour and was held over video conference, was intended to be a venue to discuss proposed solutions to making the Facebook platform less toxic, such as adding executives with civil rights experience to its top ranks and fact-checking political speech, among other changes.“Today we saw little and heard just about nothing,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, who was in the meeting. “The company is functionally flawed.”Since the groups called for the boycott, hundreds of advertisers, including well-known brands such as Unilever NV, Verizon Communications Inc., and Coca-Cola Co., have announced plans to pull advertising from Facebook’s properties over criticism the company doesn’t do enough to police user content. As the boycott grew, Facebook approached the civil rights organizations about a meeting, though the groups refused to meet without Zuckerberg in attendance.“They want Facebook to be free of hate speech and so do we,” Facebook said in a statement following the meeting. The company pointed to efforts it has made in recent years, including a mention of an audit of its policies and practices and noting that it has spent billions of dollars building systems to police its service. “We know we will be judged by our actions not by our words and are grateful to these groups and many others for their continued engagement.”Facebook has defended its attempts to fight hate speech and voter suppression in emails and phone calls with advertisers, talking up the company’s automated systems which find and remove these kinds of posts automatically. The company has also highlighted a voter registration initiative through which it hopes to register 4 million voters before the 2020 election.Greenblatt described Facebook’s claim that it catches 89% of hate speech automatically as an unacceptable number. “The Ford Motor Co. can’t say that 89% of our fleet has seatbelts that work,” he said, adding that it would require a recall. “Maybe it’s time we recall Facebook Groups? Maybe it’s time we recall the News Feed?”Another topic of discussion on the call was the civil rights audit of Facebook’s policies, which the company first started in mid-2018. Facebook, which has said it will publish the full report Wednesday, previewed some of the results with the civil rights groups during the meeting. The audit was carried out by a third party, meaning the results are independent of Facebook, but also that they are less likely to lead to change, Robinson said.“What we get is recommendations that they end up not implementing,” he added. Facebook will make some changes to add “long term civil rights infrastructure” to the company, but Robinson said the details were still “unclear.”What was clear from the outset was that the two sides wouldn’t likely come to a resolution on Tuesday. In a post before the meeting started, Sandberg acknowledged that Facebook needs to do more to fight hate speech, but also said that the company is unlikely to implement all the recommendations from the civil rights audit.The civil rights groups said that their fight with Facebook is far from over. “I believe this campaign will continue to grow,” Greenblatt said. “It will get more global, it will get more intense until we get the answers that I think we are looking for.”(Updates with more details from meeting starting from sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook Scorned by Advocacy Groups After Zuckerberg Meeting

2020-07-13,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump uses Facebook like a Swiss Army knife -- to raise money, amplify his message, and mobilize voters. His rival, Joe Biden, uses the increasingly controversial social platform primarily to stick his hand out for donations.As he did in 2016, Trump is taking advantage of the social media giant’s granular knowledge of its users’ interests to target specific ads to specific people, and is doing so much more often than Biden. This “micro-targeting” allows Trump to tap into Facebook’s unique ability to rally his base of voters, who he needs to motivate as he trails Biden in most election polls.Since entering the presidential contest in April 2019, Biden has spent $21 million on Facebook ads compared to $33 million for Trump over the same period, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But the two campaigns are spending the money very differently.On Friday, people familiar with the company’s thinking said Facebook was considering banning political ads ahead of the U.S. election, but for now it still allows candidates to narrowly target voters using its data.Micro-targeting is using all the data social networks have on a user, from location to political leaning to what brands they buy, to generate the perfect ad.Twitter Ad BanGoogle has limited how political campaigns can target voters using its digital ad sales platform, and Twitter has banned campaign ads altogether. Twitter said it did so because of the potential for ads to spread misleading information, while Google said its policy means ads are more widely viewed and available for public discussion like ones airing on television and radio are.Facebook has also taken only limited steps to ban hate speech that infiltrates some users feeds, which has led some large companies like Unilever NV, Coca-Cola Co. and Starbucks Corp. to temporarily pull their ad dollars from the site.Users can be targeted based on all kinds of information, including search and travel history. And the ads can be tweaked over time to make them more effective. The Trump campaign does constant testing of its ads and makes small changes on a daily basis.Through the morning of July 8 Biden’s campaign had bought about 23,000 distinct ads on the platform compared to more than 489,000 for Trump, according to a Bloomberg analysis of data made available by Facebook. About 68% of the president’s ads are seen fewer than 1,000 times compared to 34% for Biden, suggesting much more specific micro-targeting by Trump’s campaign.Petition DrivesBiden’s campaign is focused on raising money and attacking Trump. So far he hasn’t used Facebook to hone his message or mobilize supporters, but he’s included appeals to sign petitions, which help him build up his list of email contacts, and to donate. Recent pitches asked for 2.5 million supporters to take a stand against Trump’s “hatred, division and calls for violence” by signing an online petition.Offering less variation in his Facebook ads could hurt Biden’s efforts to reach the voters he needs, said Damon McCoy, director of the Online Political Ads Transparency Project and a professor at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. “It’s probably causing them to be less effective,” he said, because the campaign isn’t getting the same level of audience feedback.Trump’s campaign used Facebook in February to motivate voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, even as he was virtually unopposed in those state’s Republican nominating contests. The campaign put out almost 1,200 ads, which included links to find caucus or polling locations, that were seen between 1.4 million and 2.8 million times.Voter TurnoutTrump ran away with both contests, getting support of 97% of caucus-goers in Iowa and turning out 2.6 times more voters in New Hampshire than Barack Obama, another incumbent without a serious primary challenger, did in 2012. Trump used the outcome as evidence of the strength of his support.According to Facebook, which provides data on impressions, cost and other metrics in broad ranges, the total cost of the messaging was between $18,800 and $139,406.The focus on targeted ads likely helped Trump gain a big lead in early fund-raising, according to Will Bunnett, a principal at the progressive digital ad agency Clarify. But Trump may have another advantage over Biden in using the platform, he said, because of the way Facebook’s algorithm puts ads in front of people who’ll interact with them, often by getting riled up.“The easiest way to get people to interact with your ads is to get them mad about something,” Bunnett said. “Facebook is a pretty natural fit for him in a way that it might not be for Joe Biden.”Trump’s PreoccupationsA senior Trump campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the campaign was constantly testing “thousands upon thousands” of ads so voters “are hearing the facts about this president.”The Biden campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment.Some of Trump’s Facebook ads reflect his rhetoric and preoccupations.There are more than 50,000 ads mentioning “impeachment,” preceded by the word “bogus” more than 1,000 times, followed by “witch hunt” more than 4,000 times. About 40,000 ads refer to “fake news.”Old campaign themes like “build the wall” and “drain the swamp” mingle with concerns about Antifa, a loosely-defined left-wing movement Trump said was involved in the June street protests, and which appears in more than 2,000 ads. Attacks on calls to “defund the police” have been in 715 ads so far, since the term made its debut in a June 19 fund-raising pitch.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Trump Outpaces Biden in Zeroing In on Voters With Facebook Tools

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Coca-Cola Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 27.74 of the Non-Alcoholic Beverages industry.

2020-07-17,"One of the relics of the global financial crisis is that the notion of long-term stocks was dead. Back then, many experts said investors needed to become more nimble going forward or risk being exposed when the next crisis hit.Thing is from the March 10, 2009, market bottom through July 10, 2020, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) jumped 456%. That time frame certainly qualifies as &quot;long term&quot; and includes an array of pitfalls for riskier assets. These include the European sovereign debt crisis, the taper tantrum, a trade war with China and the March 2020 slide at the hands of the novel coronavirus.That SPY performance is proof positive long-term investing isn't, but what does change over time are the names that qualify as the best long-term stocks. I'm going to use Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). For generations, the world's largest soft drink maker would have qualified as a great &quot;set it and forget it&quot; stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI'm bringing up Coca-Cola because recently, I saw some folks on Twitter saying the stock only delivered returns of 3% over the past 22 years. Initially, I didn't believe it. Sure enough, it's true. Worse yet, an investor that bought Coca-Cola in 1998 would have been down 50% a decade later and needed 15 years just to get back to even. That's not best long-term stock status.  * 15 Growth Stocks That Are Being Propped Up By Low RatesGood news is there are some names out there today that could be sound set it and forget ideas. Here are a few to consider.  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * Mastercard (NYSE:MA)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Best Long-Term Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com By constructing this list in 2020, it's almost impossible to leave Microsoft off and not simply because this is the largest domestic company by market capitalization. The company is firing on all cylinders today. And, while MSFT stock is up 49% over the past year, the name is buoyed by an array of positive fundamental factors.First, a brief history lesson. Microsoft is 45 years old and went public in 1986. At a time when so many investors are smitten with shiny new objects, those factoids could be construed as strikes against Microsoft. Actually, the opposite is true because this middle-aged company is showing it's adaptable and has levers for growth.Microsoft is the second-largest cloud computing company, an impressive feat when considering the company didn't even enter that business until 2020. Today, the Azure unit is one of the fastest-growing cloud computing entities on the market, confirming Microsoft can enter a competition late and still scale its way to dominance.Adding to the case for Microsoft as one of the best long-term ideas is adaptability nurtured under the stewardship of CEO Satya Nadella. For example, core products such as Microsoft Office 365 used to be sold on a one-off basis. Now, Microsoft runs a more lucrative subscription model. This makes revenue visibility easier to ascertain - a favorable trait for long-term investors.The combination of strong leadership, a fortress balance sheet and leadership in some trends that are becoming secular tailwinds make MSFT stock an ideal long-term holding for investors of varying demographics and risk tolerances. Mastercard (MA)Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com Like Microsoft, Mastercard is classified as a technology stock, though investors often view it through a financial services lens. Put those two concepts together and you've got fintech, as known as the way of accessing growth in the financial services arena.There are more nimble, growthier fintech names than Mastercard to consider, such as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). That pair is positioned for long-term success, too. Mastercard is included here because it's less volatile than those fintech names, meaning its drawdowns over long holding periods should be less severe.Obviously, a big part of the long-term fintech thesis is the move away from cash to card and digital payments, a trend Mastercard stands to benefit from. Importantly, cards only recently surpassed cash as the world's primary payment option. This indicates the cashless trend is still in its early innings.An important feather in the cap of Mastercard is that, like other beloved companies in other industries, it's able to leverage the network effect. This is a fancy way of saying Mastercard is able to effectively monetize users even though those customers aren't directly paying the company.  * 15 Growth Stocks That Are Being Propped Up By Low Rates&quot;Payment networks such as Mastercard benefit, unsurprisingly, from a network effect,&quot; notes Morningstar. &quot;The more consumers that are plugged into a payment network, the more attractive that payment network becomes for merchants, which, in turn, makes the network more convenient for consumers and so on.&quot; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com Johnson & Johnson is the oldest and sleepiest of the stocks highlighted here and it's far from glamorous relative to other healthcare names. Those aren't knocks on JNJ and those traits don't mean this stock will succumb to the aforementioned woes of Coca-Cola. Plus, JNJ has some potential for excitement due to its participation in the Covid-19 vaccine race.JNJ isn't a growth biotechnology stock. It is able to source growth through its medical devices division, which puts the company at the corner of one of the healthcare sector's more compelling growth segments.Owing in large part to an aging population, &quot;the United States remains the largest medical device market in the world: $156 billion (40 percent of the global medical device market in 2017). By 2023, it is expected to grow to $208 billion,&quot; according to SelectUSA.JNJ is able to take some of the sting out of the pitfalls associated with the pharmaceuticals business, including patent cliffs and failed trails. The company's strengths include its consumer products business, strong balance sheet and a dividend increase streak that spans multiple decades.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

Advertising of its streaming service Disney+, as well as spending on Instagram for Disney’s Hulu streaming service, has been halted on Facebook.Disney has fewer movies to market this summer because the coronavirus lockdown led to a delay of film premieres.

2020-07-21,"Beverage giant Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) reported Tuesday morning with second quarter results that were notable for a 16% decrease in global unit case volume and a 33% decline in earnings.Earnings came in better than expected, at 42 cents per share versus a Street estimate of 40 cents per share. Revenue of $7.2 billion beat the Street estimate of $7.18 billion.Key Details On Coca-Cola's Q2: Coca-Cola's $7.2 billion in sales represent a 28% decrease, representing the worst decline seen since at least 1990, CNBC's Sara Eisen reported. Organic revenue was also down 26% in the quarter.Two key factors that drove the weakness are continued lockdowns in the second quarter along with stay-at-home orders, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told Eisen.Half of Coca-Cola's business is derived from outside the home, such as at restaurants and stadiums, he said. Volume trends sequentially improved throughout the quarter as more countries started to open up, the CEO said.View more earnings on KOFor example, Coke's July sales so far are down by a mid-single digit versus double-digit declines earlier in the second quarter.The Chinese market continues to show signs of bouncing back, but growth has not returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, Quincey said, adding that it's unclear if this trend will play out elsewhere in the world. Coca-Cola Strategy Update: Coca-Cola named six initiatives and investments to better position itself moving forward, BofA Securities analyst Bryan Spillane said in a note. They are:  * Prioritizing the best-positioned brands.  * Focusing on initiatives that can be scalable regionally or globally.  * Being mindful of spending on local experimentation.  * A refreshed marketing approach.  * System-wide efficiencies to support investments.  * Investment in capabilities to take advantage of lasting shifts in consumer behavior.Spillane maintained a Buy rating on Coca-Cola with an unchanged $53 price target.KO Price Action: Coca-Cola shares were trading 2.82% higher at $47.42 at last check Tuesday.

2020-07-21,"In Q2, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) saw a decline in both earnings and sales. Earnings decreased by 73.31% to $2.79 billion, and sales dropped by 16.87% to $7.15 billion. Coca-Cola reached earnings of $10.47 billion and sales of $8.60 billion in Q1.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Coca-Cola posted an ROCE of -1.64%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on KOROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Coca-Cola is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Coca-Cola, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions.Q2 Earnings Coca-Cola reported Q2 earnings per share at $0.2/share against analyst predictions of $0.4/share.See more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * P/E Ratio Insights for Coca-Cola(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-21,"Coca-Cola (KO) has reported a relatively in-line quarter with Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 beating Street consensus by $0.01, and GAAP EPS of $0.41 falling in-line with consensus expectations. Shares are currently rising 2.4% in Tuesday’s trading.Net revenues declined 28% to $7.2 billion, missing Street expectations by $60M. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) declined 26%. Revenue performance included a 22% decline in concentrate sales and a 4% decline in price/mix. The revenue declines were primarily driven by pressure in away-from-home channels, which represent approximately half of the company’s revenues.Top-line weakness, however, was offset by effective cost management, which enabled operating margin of 30.3% (vs consensus of 26.9%) and EPS delivery of $0.42.“We believe the second quarter will prove to be the most challenging of the year; however, we still have work to do as we drive our pursuit of ‘Beverages for Life’ and meet evolving consumer needs” said James Quincey, CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.Management again opted out of providing concrete guidance for the full year, but gave a generally cautiously optimistic take on the environment. They shared that global unit case volume trends improved from -25% in April to -10% in June (July month-to-date down LSD).But the company lost value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages as an underlying share gain was more than offset by negative channel mix due to pressure in away-from-home channels, where the company has a strong share position.Meanwhile EMEA organic growth (-35%) came in significantly worse than consensus expectations (-23%), driven by negative channel/packaging mix in Europe, but Latin America as a whole met expectations with its organic sales figure. According to management Latin America unit case volume declines of 9% were driven by Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil – primarily due to the impact of the coronavirus.“Results were very much in line with our channel work” commented RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi following the print. “Trends should continue to improve with the reopening of cities/states/countries, but rising case counts and differing opinions on back-to-school will likely put pressure on the name through year-end” he added. The analyst has a buy rating on the stock and $55 price target (16% upside potential).Overall KO stock has plunged 15% year-to-date, and analysts have a Moderate Buy consensus on the beverages giant.

Instead, investors are rewarding companies that beat lowered expectations. IBM (NYSE: IBM) is one example, with shares up 5% in pre-market trading even though the company's earnings per share fell 31% and revenue slid, too. Still, the results look great compared with analysts' estimates.KO earnings were down along with revenue. Shares rose more than 2% in pre-market trading despite those soft numbers thanks in part to the company hinting that the worst might be over. Think about it: Major League Baseball is opening this week and no one is in the stands to buy KO's main product.Not every reporting company is getting rewarded for falling earnings. Take Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), whose shares rocketed more than 3% in pre-market trading after the company reported EPS and revenue both rising nicely from a year ago and beating analysts' estimates. For an extra, LMT sprinkled in some raised guidance.The earnings bonanza continues after the close with Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL). TXN gives us the first look at Q2 in the chip industry. Stocks in this sector have trounced the broader market since bottoming in March, helped by the &quot;stay at home&quot; trade.Big Travel Week The trip begins this afternoon with UAL, followed later this week by American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (LUV). UAL could be number one on the runway, so to speak, influencing other travel stocks not only by its Q2 numbers, but by what its executives have to say about Q3 and Q4. Will the airlines have anything positive to share even as flights continue to operate at low capacity and thousands of flight crew employees take voluntary retirement in these difficult times? We'll find out soon.We've said in the past that earnings drive stocks and that's what actually matters. This year, maybe not so much. Everyone's pretty much-expecting travel company earnings to be awful in Q2. It's what they say about Q3 that really can have some influence. Unfortunately, the virus continues to be unpredictable, with cases growing rapidly.Hopes abound, however, for some progress on that front. The week got off to a good start partly from the FAANGs, but also because we saw three different news reports yesterday on progress with possible vaccines. These included one from Oxford University/AstraZeneca plc (NYSE: AZN), one from a Chinese company, and one from Pfizer Inc (PFE) in its collaboration with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX).Having good data helped put a charge into things, but as noted here in the past, investors shouldn't get carried away. These are all early-stage trials. The rubber hits the road when bigger, longer-term trial data starts to come out later this year. Medicine is full of studies that looked great early on and failed in the more real-world scenario of Phase III clinical trials.Let's hope that's not the case this time because so much of the rally from lows seems predicated on the belief that one or more companies will quickly find a treatment or vaccine.FAANGS and Friends FAANGS started the party yesterday, and just about the entire market took a hint.Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) led off the game with a homer after getting a target price of $3,800 painted on its back by a Goldman Sachs (GS) analyst. Shares of AMZN had their biggest day in months, rising nearly 8% and basically erasing memories of last week's slog.Whether or not you think AMZN deserves the lofty target, it stands to reason people might get enthusiastic about the company when you consider that online shopping and cloud computing--AMZN's bread and butter--are both exploding during the pandemic.Other FAANGs like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB)--which, along with AMZN, are coming up on earnings reports-- followed AMZN higher. Microsoft Inc (NASDAQ: MSFT), sometimes thought of as the FAANG's older cousin, jumped an incredible 4% ahead of its earnings report tomorrow. Another popular stock sometimes grouped with Tech and reporting earnings Wednesday is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), which also took a sharp ride higher yesterday.Where the FAANGs go, the Nasdaq (COMP) often follows. That definitely was the way it went yesterday, kind of reversing last week's pattern where Tech sat on the sidelines for a bit. One day isn't a trend, of course, so we'll see what Tech can do for an encore today. The COMP posted a new record closing high yesterday, so that has a chance to maybe spark some profit-taking.This Tech-led rally eventually made itself felt in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), both of which had lackluster starts Monday morning before catching a slight tailwind. However, some of the reopening stocks like airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and restaurants lagged a bit. You can't necessarily rule out more of that as the week advances, maybe in part because a lot of the transports and travel firms report soon and some of those numbers are probably going to look ugly.  CHART OF THE DAY: JOINED AT THE HIP. It's interesting to see how the S&P 500 Index (SPX--candlestick) and gold futures (/GC--purple line) have, for the most part, been moving in lockstep since early March. Gold is considered a risk-off asset, and typically equities and gold move in opposite directions. It's unusual to see the two move together, so this relationship is something to keep a close eye on. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices, CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  A Little Green: The SPX closed in positive territory for the year yesterday and eclipsed the June 8 closing high that had been the best close since the pandemic began. Yesterday's close was the highest for the SPX since Feb. 20. If you remember, that was right before the murky Monday that saw the SPX begin its huge plunge with a drop of more than 100 points in a single session.All that seems far behind now, which is kind of ironic considering the virus count continues to spike in parts of the country. Volatility readings arguably tell us that investors feel more optimistic than in a long time, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) falling below 25 on Monday.Despite all that, 10-year Treasury yields can't seem to climb out of the ditch, trading near 0.61% early Tuesday. Gold is rising again this week and remains at nine-year highs above $1,800 an ounce. Small-caps also gave back a little ground. There's plenty of caution out there if you know where to look.A Back-to-School Season Like No Other: Speaking of newspapers, open one of your choices and you're likely going to find articles about how back-to-school shopping might be affected by the coronavirus and potential &quot;hybrid&quot; or online school schedules. Some of the reports sound negative, but the National Retail Federation (NRF) is having none of that. Last week, they put out a press release predicting record back-to-school sales due to, what else? The virus.Parents with children in elementary school through high school say they plan to spend an average $789.49 per family, topping the previous record of $696.70 they said they would spend last year, the NRF said. Spending is expected to total $33.9 billion, up from $26.2 billion last year, and breaking the record of $30.3 billion set in 2012. When you add in college, the combined spend is projected to reach $101.6 billion--exceeding last year's $80.7 billion and topping the $100 billion mark for the first time.Who Benefits from School Sales? If the NRF is right, its would be great news for many of the big retailers out there like Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT), and even for places you don't think of for school shopping trips but still get business on last-minute pens, calculators, and notebooks like Walgreen's Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS). Discount stores like Dollar Tree Inc (NASDAQ: DLTR) and Dollar General Corp (NYSE: DG) could also be in the mix, but discount retailers are seen attracting far fewer shoppers than a year ago, according to the NRF. Stores with a big online presence like TGT and WMT could benefit most, as 55% of the K-12 school shopping is expected to be online, up from 49% a year ago, the press release said.Why the big expected sales leap overall? It could be due in part to one major and expensive item: Laptops. Online learning makes it essential for most kids. The NRF said its back-to-school survey showed laptop sales rising 36% from a year ago. So more good news, potentially, for Info Tech, particularly hardware makers like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE: DELL), and Hong Kong-based Lenovo.This week's economic calendar.

Here’s Why.
2020-07-22,"Beverage giant Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) is trading at an &quot;outsized valuation discount&quot; versus its peers, and investors should take advantage of the compelling valuation gap, according to Morgan Stanley.The Coca-Cola Analyst: Dara Mohsenian upgraded Coca-Cola from Equal-weight to Overweight with a price target lifted from $52 to $54.The Coca-Cola Thesis: Morgan Stanley moved to the sidelines in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic given Coca-Cola's 40% exposure to eating and dining out and another 10% of the business tied to gas and convenience channels, Mohsenian said in a Wednesday upgrade note.Yet Coca-Cola's recent second-quarter print looks to signal a bottom point,and consensus estimates moving forward are &quot;more reasonable,&quot; the analyst said. Some of the encouraging takeaways from Coca-Cola's print are as follows, he said:  * Unit case volume improved from negative 25% in April to down by mid-single digits to-date in July.  * Volume weakness was tied to short-term lockdown measures.  * Coca-Cola expects to return to pre-pandemic levels before a global economic recovery.  * Coca-Cola will protect forward earnings through productivity improvements.The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index by 2,800 basis points over the past fourth months and underperformed its mega-cap consumer packaged goods peers by 1,700 basis points, Mohsenian said.From a valuation perspective, Coca-Cola's relative NTM P/E multiple implies a 3% discount versus mega-cap peers, and this is also more than one standard deviation below the 10-year average, the analyst said. The same holds true for out-year estimates, as Coca-Cola's stock is trading at a 7% P/E discount to its mega-cap peers on 2022 estimates versus a 6% premium at the start of 2020, according to Morgan Stanley. KO Price Action: Shares of Coca-Cola were trading higher by 1.59% at $47.94 at last check Wednesday.

2020-07-31,"(Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc.’s second-quarter sales topped analysts’ highest estimates, rebounding from a pandemic-fueled disruption to digital advertising earlier in the year as its social media apps continued to draw more users.Revenue rose 11% to $18.7 billion, compared with the $17.3 billion average analyst projection. Facebook’s main social network logged 2.7 billion monthly active users in the period, according to a statement Thursday, compared with the 2.63 billion average estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Shares jumped about 6.5% in late trading.Facebook, whose business model is built on collecting user information so ad messages can reach the most fruitful targets, made the case that such targeting is now an essential service for small businesses forced to close storefronts during the Covid-19 outbreak. On a conference call, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said government privacy regulations -- some already in progress, some threatened for the future -- “would reduce opportunities for small businesses so much,” at a time when their livelihoods depend on reaching out to locked-down customers. “That would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level, and is that really what policymakers want in the middle of a pandemic in recession?” Zuckerberg said.Facebook shares soared as high as $254 in extended trading following the report, on track to reach a record, after closing at $234.50. The stock had gained 14% so far this year.The better-than-forecast report shows advertisers were willing to boost budgets in the second quarter after holding off earlier in the year. Profit doubled to $5.18 billion, or $1.80 a share, beating the $1.39 per-share average estimate. Because of Facebook’s vast reach and the rise in usage during the pandemic, the company’s results have been able to withstand a broader economic slowdown better than many other large companies.Most of Facebook’s advertising revenue comes from small and medium-sized businesses that have few other options to reach customers. But not all advertisers are happy with the Facebook option. In the current quarter, Facebook is confronting an advertiser boycott, after civil rights leaders called on major brands to protest the company’s handling of harmful content and misinformation. More than 1,000 advertisers, from Verizon Communications Inc. to Coca-Cola Co., pulled promotions from Facebook starting in July.Still, Facebook said ad revenue in the first three weeks of July was in line with the second quarter’s 10% growth rate, taking into account “the impact from certain advertisers pausing spend on our platforms related to the current boycott.”Facebook’s problems are “short-term and not structural, as FB has a good track record of managing advertiser concerns,” Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee wrote in a note to investors before the report.The Menlo Park, California-based company said that every month, 3.14 billion people use at least one of its products, including photo-sharing app Instagram and the WhatsApp messaging platform. Facebook said user growth is likely to slow or flatten as shelter-in-place orders are lifted. The company has continued to hire rapidly during the pandemic, and ended the quarter with 52,534 employees. That’s up 32% from a year earlier.Researcher EMarketer attributed the positive quarterly results to Instagram. Facebook doesn’t break out revenue for Instagram, though people familiar with the matter have said the mobile app brings in more than a quarter of Facebook’s sales.“Instagram has played a major role in Facebook’s ability to withstand the effects of the pandemic,” said EMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. “Its success is helping to buoy Facebook as a whole.”The company’s earnings report was delayed from Wednesday, the day of an antitrust subcommittee hearing in the U.S. House, where representatives for hours interrogated Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, alongside other tech leaders. Armed with documents collected during the inquiry, the lawmakers asked Zuckerberg about Facebook’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, which Zuckerberg admitted were purchased in part to remove competition.Zuckerberg also told the Congressional panel that he was listening to the advertiser boycott, but was “not going to set our content policies because of advertisers. I believe that that would be the wrong thing to do.”In its outlook, Facebook said it expects business to become more challenging because of new regulations, like the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as changes to mobile operating platforms “which we anticipate will be increasingly significant as the year progresses.” Apple’s iOS 14 smartphone operating system, soon to be released, will put restrictions on tracking users across apps -- a tool that Facebook relies on for targeting mobile ads.(Updates with details from conference call in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Facebook’s Second-Quarter Sales Top Estimates as Ads Rebound

2020-08-04,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When U.S. antitrust laws were first written more than a hundred years ago, the word “data” had a slightly different meaning, referring mainly to facts and manually-compiled information. You didn’t hear it much in everyday language, and it certainly wasn’t associated with trust-busting. In the digital world of today, it’s come to mean the measurable tidbits and inputs that add up to make every program and app — and thus much of the world’s economy — function. And the fact that it isn’t anywhere to be found in antitrust rules is a big problem.To have data is to have power, and collecting it is the lifeblood of four of the most valuable companies in America: Facebook Inc., Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Together, they are worth more than $5 trillion by market cap. That’s like adding up the market values of Walmart Inc., Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Procter & Gamble Co., Pfizer Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Nike Inc., McDonald’s Corp. and Walt Disney Co. — and then multiplying that sum by two. Calling it “Big Tech” doesn’t even do it justice.These leaders of social-media, online-search, e-commerce and smartphones are so embedded in consumers’ lives that it’s nearly impossible to avoid interacting with them on a given day and handing over reams of data, all for free, in the process: Checking emails, “liking” a post about Taylor Swift, clicking on an enchiladas recipe, joining a group for novice knitters, searching for bug spray and new eyeglass frames, looking up the UPS store’s hours and directions to it, downloading a fitness app and geo-tagging a selfie at the beach — innocuous activities that are meticulously tracked to build a profile of who you are and predict how you’ll spend your money.That power hasn’t gone unnoticed by regulators, Congress and other critics, many of whom wonder whether the companies’ dominance is a sign that current antitrust laws have come up short in regulating this relatively new industry. The answer is, they have — and that’s not all that surprising considering current laws were written with largely traditional businesses in mind, in which a tangible product or a service is built using suppliers and then sold to an end user. How Big Tech makes money can feel a bit more nebulous to an outsider, as well as who exactly is hurt by some of the industry’s practices. Their customers are advertisers and other large and small businesses. The product is, well, you.Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, appeared last Wednesday over video chat before a Congressional committee that’s investigating whether the industry has a monopoly problem. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining whether past acquisitions by these companies were anticompetitive. The industry doesn’t see it that way; when the members of Congress pointed to known instances of data misuse or overreach, the CEOs often chalked it up to one-offs or minor mishaps, rather than patterns of harmful business practice aimed at squelching competition. Where critics see an anticompetitive move, Big Tech sees a noble effort to improve service for consumers.It’s time that antitrust laws were updated so that regulators can better chaperone the industry — and its treasure trove of data — for it is both an immense intellectual and economic national asset and an opaque force with the power to capitalize on unknowing consumers and suppress rival businesses. Even with the best of intentions to create beneficial services that keep the world connected and informed, the result of Big Tech having such unchecked power over reams of valuable information has been to leave consumers and third-party partners comparatively powerless.Amassing so much data isn’t inherently anticompetitive — nor does it directly hit people’s wallets — but regulators need to look at how it’s collected and used and take action when competition is harmed in the process. Amazon makes for the simplest example of how it can become problematic: The company has been accused of using the highly detailed information it gathers from sellers on its marketplace to inform what products to make for its own private label, AmazonBasics, and to undercut the competition. That’s a major conflict of interest and an unfair advantage over third-party sellers, but there’s nothing those sellers can really do about it — Amazon is practically the only game in town. (Would any reasonable person consider Etsy Inc. or even EBay Inc. to be substitutes?) Bezos said using seller data to aid Amazon’s own brand would be a company violation, but he didn’t deny that it happens and said he’s looking into the issue.This type of accusation against Amazon is the clearest example of monopoly power. Others aren't so clear-cut. My colleague Tae Kim summarizes more of the complaints about the companies here and explains why issues around Google are particularly thorny. This is precisely where the U.S. antitrust framework gets tripped up by the digital-data industry. Take the U.S. guidelines on mergers, which state:A merger enhances market power if it is likely to encourage one or more firms to raise price, reduce output, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm customers as a result of diminished competitive constraints or incentives.Rising prices are the most obvious way mergers can be harmful. But small acquisitions by Big Tech tend to fall into that all-encompassing “otherwise harm” category described above. Facebook’s 2012 takeover of Instagram was harmful because it left social-media users with few alternatives, forcing them in effect to accept the company’s terms and further widening its lead over newcomer apps. Even if regulators couldn’t have predicted this at the time, it’s indisputable now that Facebook dominates social media and that spinning off Instagram would restore competition. (It would probably be good for shareholders, too, as Tae Kim has argued.)The FTC says that antitrust laws were intentionally written in general terms, allowing them to be broadly applied and interpreted in changing times on a case-by-case basis. But it may be that they are overly broad to the point of being antiquated, or at least not specific enough to effectively govern Big Tech. For example, the idea of “prices” should also include the price social-media users pay — the level of data they must fork over and the loss of control they have over that data. Another steep price that can be paid in the digital era is a privacy breach. Facebook’s controversies involving its data aren’t merely public-relations matters — they stem from competitive dominance and insufficient regulatory oversight.Antitrust enforcement also comes down to how regulators define markets. “In the absence of price competition, market definition can be difficult,” Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a November speech regarding the data industry. “Antitrust enforcers may need to play an even greater role in zero-price markets,” he said. Rather than a zero-price market, Google and Facebook would argue that they compete healthily in the $333 billion global digital-advertising space, with Amazon nipping at their heels in the U.S. and Apple’s devices serving as conduits. But the ad market provides an incomplete picture, and that framing implies these companies are merely a powerful foursome. Defining the market more narrowly — and more accurately — shows how each one has instead become a monopoly of sorts, having carved out its own silo with few, if any, true competitors.Advertisers may regularly adjust how much money to allocate to each site, but they generally need to be present on all of them. Facebook provides the ability to target ultra-specific subsets of people. Google isn’t just a search engine, it’s the primary verb people use for search, and it further feeds that dominance by scraping useful information from other pages, making its products priority destinations. For sellers of goods, Amazon’s marketplace offers the best reach. App developers don’t have much choice than to agree to the Apple app store’s onerous terms and fees. Consumers don’t pick and choose between these products and services either — they must use them all or accept life under a rock. Regulators would also be more effective if antitrust laws specified how data can be used and with what limitations, as well as requirements for safeguarding it. That would prevent Amazon from having such porous walls between its marketplace and internal brand. It could put an end to Google’s practice of paying to keep its search engine dominant and being able to direct so much traffic toward its own sites. Data should no longer be thought of as just an input for effective advertising, but rather the focal point of the question of whether Big Tech has too much power. If the answer is yes, and the remedy is creating an environment that would allow more Instagrams and Googles to flourish, wouldn’t everyone benefit? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-08-05,"Shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) saw some unusual options activity on Wednesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $47.05.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $47.50  * Volume: 4016  * Open Interest: 130813 Indications of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.A contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another tell of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being &quot;out of the money&quot;. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are &quot;bullish&quot; when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are &quot;bearish&quot; when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Strategies to Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 22, 2020  * P/E Ratio Insights for Coca-Cola(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-21,"Blue-chip stocks are often regarded as some of the best stocks to buy on Wall Street. Why?Because the companies behind the blue chips are supposed to be the cream-of-the-crop. Large-cap titans of industry, with long histories of growth, strong management teams, rock-solid balance sheets, robust future growth prospects and tons of visibility to long-term gains in revenues, profits and the stock price.In other words, these are the stocks that you want to buy today, and hold for the next 5 to 10 years, because strong fundamentals will power these stocks materially higher in the long run.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever With that in mind, here are my 20 favorite blue-chip stocks to buy for the 2020s:  * Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)  * Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)  * Clorox (NYSE:CLX)  * Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  * Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL)  * Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU)  * PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)  * Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)  * AT&T (NYSE:T)  * Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)  * Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  * Target (NYSE:TGT)  * Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)  * Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Facebook (FB)Source: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com One of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the long term is Facebook, and the bull thesis on the social media giant is shockingly simple.Through its ecosystem of four digital media apps with endless functionality, Facebook has created the world's largest and stickiest digital ecosystem, without competition. Engagement in that ecosystem will only increase over time. As it does, more and more ad dollars -- which are already pivoting from the offline to the online channel -- will make their way into the Facebook ad machine.Plus, the company has a huge opportunity in front of it to turn all that digital engagement into digital shopping, and create a world-class e-commerce platform with unparalleled reach.To that end, Facebook projects as a solid 20%-plus revenue and profit grower over the next few years -- and that's easily big enough growth to sustain a big uptrend in FB stock. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com A more classic blue-chip stock to buy for the long term is Coca-Cola.Coca-Cola is the world's largest beverage company. More importantly, though, the company has found a winning strategy which ensures that it will remain the world's largest beverage company for the foreseeable future.That strategy includes leaning into data-driven market analysis to identify up-and-coming beverage brands, taking small stakes in those up-and-coming brands, pushing them through Coca-Cola's vast distribution network, seeing which ones succeed in that distribution network and then subsequently wholly acquiring the brands that do succeed and fully integrating them into the Coca-Cola product portfolio.It's a win-win strategy which will forever ensure that Coca-Cola has the strongest and most relevant brands in its beverage portfolio, thereby sustaining solid revenue and profit growth for the foreseeable future.  * 10 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul That solid growth will power equally solid gains in KO stock. Blue-Chip Stocks: Apple (AAPL)Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com Another classic blue-chip stock to buy for the long term is Apple.The world's largest technology company with a $2 trillion market cap, Apple isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The company's hardware business is flourishing, as the iPhone's global ubiquity is being protected by &quot;good enough&quot; hardware advancements, Mac and iPad sales should boom in an hybrid work environment and Apple Watch sales should keep surging as 5G unlocks a new era of advanced IoT communication.Meanwhile, Apple is rapidly expanding its software ecosystem, too, building out things like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, so on and so forth. These services will see continued robust uptake for the foreseeable future as consumer engagement shifts to the digital -- and specifically mobile -- channel.The convergence of growth in both its hardware and software businesses will help power big revenue and profit gains at Apple over the next few years. Those big gains will keep the current uptrend in AAPL stock alive for a lot longer. Nike (NKE)Source: pixfly / Shutterstock.com In the apparel world, the best blue-chip stock to buy for the the long term is Nike.The whole world is pivoting towards broader adoption of athletic apparel in situations outside of just working out, mostly because consumers are opting for comfort over fashion, and athletic shorts, leggings and tank tops represent some of the comfiest clothes out there. This trend won't reverse course anytime soon. Athletic apparel will remain the &quot;in&quot; style for many years to come.Nike is at the top dog in the industry. Without much competition. The company has leaned into its relentless product innovation, star-studded portfolio of athlete endorsements and purpose-driven marketing to continually elevate brand equity and consumer demand. This trend won't reverse course anytime soon, either. Nike will remain the king of athletic apparel for many years to come.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week It doesn't take a rocket scientist to connect those dots. Nike projects as the best-in-breed apparel retail company for a lot longer, a reality which means NKE stock is sold stock to buy for the next 5 to 10 years. Blue-Chip Stocks: Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Adobe is a great blue-chip stock to buy for three very simple reasons.One, the company dominates in the visual media solutions space -- a space which, thanks to the fact that the world increasingly communicates in pictures and videos, is underpinned by secular growth drivers. Adobe's solutions in this space will maintain robust demand over the next few years.Two, the company also dominates in enterprise virtualization solutions, helping companies on their paper-to-digital transformations. As the world increasingly pivots into a hybrid work environment, this transformation will accelerate, and demand for Adobe's digital document solutions will increase.Three, Adobe is making aggressive and impressive moves in the enterprise cloud world, where the company is leveraging its visual media expertise to develop visually-driven cloud marketing solutions for enterprises. This business has huge long-term potential.All in all, then, Adobe will continue to grow revenues and profits at a solid double-digit pace over the next 5+ years, a stretch during which ADBE stock should just keep running higher. Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Peteri / Shutterstock.com When it comes to blue-chip technology stocks, Microsoft is about as good as it gets.The company has long been a global technology powerhouse. It has maintained this strong standing because the company continues to innovate and create relevant offerings in the tech world.The most recent innovation, of course, is in cloud, where Microsoft has developed a series of cloud-hosted infrastructure, productivity and collaboration tools which help facilitate hybrid work environments.Demand for these tools will remain robust for the next several years.  * 5 SPAC Stocks With Recently Agreed On Merger Deals to Watch As it does, MSFT stock will keep pushing higher. Blue-Chip Stocks: McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com In the food space, the best blue-chip stock to buy is McDonald's.McDonald's dominates on the two things that matter most in the fast casual restaurant space: price and convenience.McDonald's consistently innovates to reduce labor costs and food costs so as to offer the lowest prices in the market on burgers, fries and shakes. At the same time, the company has the largest fast food footprint in the world, with a McDonald's seemingly on every corner of every city in the world. On top of that, technological improvements -- like automated ordering kiosks and streamlined digital ordering -- only enhance McDonald's convenience.So long as McDonald's continues to dominate on the price and convenience fronts, MCD stock will stay on a long-term uptrend. Intel (INTC)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The stock has been beaten and bruised over the past few months thanks to product delays, but semiconductor giant Intel remains one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the 2020s.The bull thesis is simple. Intel may be fumbling right now. But this is the 400 pound gorilla in the global CPU market, which has a long track record of operational excellence, and enough resources and talent to get the company back on track over the next few years.Once Intel does get back on track in terms of speed-to-market, there's a lot to like, mostly because the global CPU market will see significant demand growth in the 2020s thanks to the widespread proliferation of 5G, AI, IoT, cloud, AR/VR, self-driving, etc.  * 3 Terrible Investments That Are Better Than Hertz Stock With all that in mind, Intel stock is a great buy for the next decade. Blue-Chip Stocks: Clorox (CLX)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are entering a &quot;new normal&quot;, and because of that, Clorox stock is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy for the 2020s.I'm not all that pessimistic about the implications of the pandemic over the next several years. I don't think mask-wearing and social distancing will become the norm for years. Instead, I think the world will return to mostly normal over the next few years.But one thing that will permanently change is consumer awareness of hygiene and cleanliness. Individuals and businesses alike are going to use more hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, Lysol spray, etc.Who makes all those products? Clorox.As such, in the &quot;new normal&quot;, demand for Clorox cleaning materials will remain vigorous. This sustained vigorous demand will guide CLX stock higher over the next several years. Amazon (AMZN)Source: Ioan Panaite / Shutterstock.com Of course, this list of blue-chip stocks to buy would be incomplete without Amazon.The e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut with burgeoning digital ad, video game streaming and offline retail businesses is, without question, one of the best stocks to buy for the next 5 to 10 years.That's because everywhere consumers and businesses are pivoting, Amazon is already there, with a best-in-market offering.The company owns the e-commerce and cloud computing spaces.

Blue-Chip Stocks: Alphabet (GOOG)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com Next to Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, Alphabet is yet another solid blue-chip tech stock to buy for the 2020s.The bull thesis here really starts with the fact that Google Search is the ubiquitous backbone of the internet everywhere except China. That is, without search, the internet doesn't work. And Google Search owns more than 90% of the internet search market.This ubiquity puts Alphabet at the epicenter of the secular shift in ad dollars from offline to online, which in it of itself, will support solid growth at Alphabet over the next decade.But Alphabet's bull thesis doesn't end with Google Search.There's YouTube, a hyper-growth visual media platform that's also unrivaled in terms of size in that space. There's Google Cloud, the third largest cloud computing business in the world. And, of course, there's Waymo -- the company's self-driving unit that is widely considered the number one autonomous driving business in the world.Between all those growth levers, Alphabet -- and GOOG stock -- will remain big winners for the foreseeable future. Lululemon (LULU)Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com Athletic apparel is the hottest trend in the retail world today -- and will remain so for the foreseeable future.While Nike is the best blue-chip stock to buy in this space, Lululemon is a very close runner-up.What Lululemon lacks in size and age relative to Nike, it makes up for in growth and trendiness. The company has been consistently growing sales at a very healthy 10%-plus pace for several years, while the brand has rose to top-of-mind for young consumers. Some of this success is because of the company's high-quality clothes, while some is due to Lululemon's continued innovation in its product pipeline to extend well beyond its legacy leggings.All of these trends will remain in place for the next few years.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever As they do, Lululemon will continue to grow sales at a 10%-plus pace, and LULU stock will keep powering higher. Blue-Chip Stocks: PayPal (PYPL)Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Cash is quickly becoming antiquated thanks to the consumer pivot towards e-commerce, and as a result, PayPal stock is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy today.Of course, when buying things online, you can't use cash. So consumers are rapidly adopting alternative payment methods for the digital channel. PayPal is the largest of those alternative digital payment methods.On that basis alone, PayPal should grow at a healthy pace over the next several years as consumers continue to pivot towards digital shopping.But PayPal also owns Venmo -- the world's hottest mobile payment platform -- which will continue to grow rapidly over the next several years as the mobile payments space expands globally.Venmo plus PayPal equals huge growth.And huge growth will keep PYPL stock on a winning streak. Alibaba (BABA)Source: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com Moving across the Pacific Ocean, Alibaba is the best blue-chip Chinese stock to buy for the 2020s.China's digital economy is booming. You have the largest country in the planet in terms of people. That country is rapidly digitizing and urbanizing. Incomes are rising. The middle class is expanding.Alibaba is at the epicenter of all of that.With the country's biggest e-commerce platform, biggest cloud computing business and various other hyper-growth digital businesses.That's a recipe for long-term success.  * The 10 Top Stocks to Buy and Hold Into 2021 Over the next several years, as China's digital economy booms, Alibaba will boom, too, and BABA stock will continue to track higher. Blue-Chip Stocks: AT&T (T)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Maybe the most &quot;boring&quot; stock on this list of blue-chip stocks to buy is telecommunications giant AT&T.But don't let AT&T's boring-ness fool you.This is a top quality blue-chip stock, supported by a long track record of dominance in the telecom space, and enduring demand for wireless, internet and TV connectivity services.5G will be a huge catalyst for this stock, as it will increase demand for those connectivity services and likely lead to higher prices and better margins for AT&T. Plus, this telecom company is now basically a media company with the acquisition of Time Warner. Using media assets acquired in that deal, AT&T recently launched HBO Max -- the company's version of Netflix.All together, then, AT&T may not grow as quickly as the other companies on this list. But demand is stable, and the growth outlook is good enough that this really cheap stock should perform strongly over the next few years. Qualcomm (QCOM)Source: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com One of the most defining megatrends of the 2020s will be the widespread proliferation and global normalization of 5G.The best blue-chip stock to buy to play this megatrend is Qualcomm.Qualcomm makes the chips which power smartphones, and the company has created what is essentially a monopoly in the smartphone chips market. This monopoly has been pressured by smartphone makers like Apple and Huawei trying to make their own chips in recent.Both companies were unsuccessful. Both are now long-term Qualcomm customers… again.To that end, it's clear to see that Qualcomm is really unrivaled when it comes to making smartphone chips, at a time when smartphone demand will roar high thanks to 5G making these phones faster and better than ever before.  * 7 Marijuana Stocks to Buy As the Industry Continues to Grow Thus, over the next few years, Qualcomm's revenues and profits will charger higher on the back of 5G tailwinds.

Now, thanks to price and convenience advantages, streaming TV is replacing linear TV as the preferred media consumption channel. By the end of the decade, every internet household in the world will subscribe to some streaming TV service.Netflix will undoubtedly be one of the streaming TV services which every household in the world does subscribe to.Sure. There's lot of competition in this space. But Netflix has first-mover advantage, which has given the company more resources and more data to make better original content than anyone else in the streaming space.Better content attracts more subs. More subs gives the company more resources and more data, which leads to better content. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.This favorable growth flywheel will enable Netflix to keep growing by leaps and bounds over the next several years. Target (TGT)Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Physical retailers are tough to pitch as &quot;top blue-chip stocks to buy&quot; given that consumers are migrating out of the physical shopping channel and into the digital one.But entirely digital isn't the future of retail. Omni-channel is -- and a result, Target is a top blue-chip stock to buy for the next few years.Target has become a master in omni-channel retail. The company has revamped physical stores and integrated them with a bunch of technology so that the in-store shopping experience is much better than before. The company has also created a robust e-commerce platform backed by a widespread logistics network, and developed a myriad of omni-channel capabilities (like buy online, pick-up-in-store) to marry the physical with the digital.In other words, Target has established a solid foundation to be a strong retailer for many years to come. The company's ever expanding one-stop-shop value prop doesn't hurt, either.  * 5 Things Every Private Investor Should Know About Startup Investing Thus, over the next few years, Target will sustain steady revenue and profit growth. That steady growth will power steady gains in TGT. Blue-Chip Stocks: Shopify (SHOP)Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com The hottest company on this list of blue-chip stocks to buy is Shopify.The e-commerce platform company has emerged as one of Wall Street's favorite companies because it is providing online selling tools which are becoming absolutely necessary for small to medium sized merchants, most of whom didn't have an internet presence in 2019 but all of whom are being forced into the online channel in 2020.This trend will accelerate over the next several years. Online shopping will only increase. More and more businesses will lean into their e-commerce operations. And websites will become the new storefronts, in that they will reach merchant ubiquity.Who will build those websites? Make them pretty? Enable them to process transactions? Tie them into a robust logistics network?Shopify.And that's why Shopify will remain a huge growth company for the next 5 to 10 years.

2020-08-21,"Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is the world's largest soft drink maker and it has one of the most recognizable brands of any company in any industry, but KO stock lacks sizzle and it has for some time.Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com Undoubtedly, there was a time when Coca-Cola was a cornerstone of many Americans' portfolios. Should today's younger investors discuss KO stock with their grandparents, they're likely to come away thinking the member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a must-own.Alas, it's not. In fact, the 21st century represents two decades of disappointment for Coca-Cola investors. From the first trading day of the year 2000 through Aug. 1, 2020, shares of Coca-Cola are higher by just over 68%, less than half the 154.26% returned by the Dow over the same period.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMaking that laggard status all the worse is that Pepsico (NASDAQ:PEP), the stock Coca-Cola is most frequently compared, has more than quadrupled since Jan. 1, 2000.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now In this era of rampant day trading and growth stocks delivering big gains in short order, measuring performance over two decades-plus may not seem relevant, but with consumer staples stocks like Coke and Pepsi, long-term measurement is relevant because investors prize these names for steadiness and typically hold these equities for lengthy periods of time. New Products and KO StockThere are a couple of reasons why investors get fooled into Coca-Cola over Pepsico. First, there's Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) owning a massive chunk of KO stock - one that the conglomerate has held for decades. Buffett is a great pitchman for the stock because he's frequently photographed sipping cans of Coke.Plus, Berkshire has owned the stock for so long and made so much money on it, that Buffett's feet are never held to the fire regarding the past two decades of disappointment by this name. Second, unknowing investors assume that because Coca-Cola Classic and Diet Coke are the two best-selling sodas in the world that this stock is &quot;better&quot; than Pepsico. Obviously, price action says otherwise.What Coca-Cola has a history of moving slowly into growth areas of food and beverage. Pepsico beat its rival to the punch in sports drinks and teas, to name just two, and Coca-Cola never developed a snack business to come anywhere close to rivaling Pepsi's Frito Lay unit.More recently, Coca-Cola affirmed its slow-moving ways, saying it plans to launch a hard seltzer line under its Topo Chico brand in Latin America later this year and in the U.S. in 2021. This isn't a case of better late than never.Yes, hard seltzer is a growing category in the beverage space, but it's no longer kitschy. This is a segment that's attracted big players with the resources to ward off Coca-Cola competition.Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and Molson Coors Brewing (NYSE:TAP), just to name a few, are among the companies Coca-Cola will have to tussle with in the seltzer arena and because those firms have been in the space awhile, it becomes harder for new entrants to pilfer business. Coke Stock Isn't the Staples Name to BuyOne thing investors can bank on with Coca-Cola is dividend growth. The company's payout increase streak reached 58 straight years with a modest hike in February. The stock now yields 3.40%, which is exceptional in the current environment.However, above-average yields and reliable dividend growth are accessible throughout the staples sector. For example, Pepsi's dividend increase is measured in decades, too. That is to say investors should not buy Coca-Cola simply for the dividend because they'll be left disappointed.This year proves as much. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index is higher by 2.45% year-to-date while KO stock is lower by almost 13%.Todd Shriber has been an InvestorPlace contributor since 2014.

2020-08-21,"Since the equity markets hit a bottom in March, the bull run has been the strongest since the Great Depression, according to the Wall Street Journal. But sustaining this will not be easy. If anything, it's probably a good idea to consider safe stocks to buy for your portfolio.One of the risks for the markets is the upcoming election. With the novel coronavirus, there will be a much larger portion of the population that will vote by mail -- and this could easily delay the results. The uncertainty could mean a spike in volatility. In fact, this happened during the election in 2000.Next, there are signs of frothiness. Many tech stocks and IPOs have seen parabolic moves on the upside. Perhaps the most notable example of the exuberance is when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock jumped because of an announcement of a stock split. Keep in mind that this kind of market action was common during the later stages of the dot-com boom.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd finally, there are signs that the economic recovery has stalled out. The lack of a stimulus agreement will also likely weigh on growth.  * 6 International Stocks to Buy for Impressive Returns Now OK then, in light of all this, what are some of the safe stocks to buy now? Well, here's a look at seven:  * Visa (NYSE:V)  * Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)  * Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  * Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  * Nike (NYSE:NKE)  * McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)  * Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Safe Stocks to Buy: Visa (V)Source: Teerawit Chankowet / Shutterstock.com Founded in 1958, Visa's future still looks bright. It certainly helps that the company has built a powerful platform with significant barriers to entry and network effects.It's true that the pandemic has weighed on the company. In the latest quarter, earnings dropped by 23% and payments volume was off by 10%. A big reason for this was the steep fall in travel activity. But keep in mind that Visa has been able to offset some of this through improvements in other parts of the business.For example, the volume of activity for card-not-present transactions -- such as for those online -- jumped by 25% each week since the start of April. This is a doubling of the growth rate compared to before the pandemic. For the first half of this year, Visa issued over than 80 million contactless cards in the U.S.In the meantime, the company has been paring back its expenses. This has been largely due to lower spending on advertising and marketing.Visa has also been investing aggressively in fintech technologies. Earlier in the year, the company shelled out $5.3 billion for Plaid, which is a top integration platform for connecting to third-party financial systems. And with V stock fetching a valuation of $450 billion and a hefty cash balance, there is plenty of resources to continue the deal-making. Coca-Cola (KO)Source: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.com When it comes to safe stocks to buy, Coca-Cola has the essential factors. The company's moat includes over 500 strong brands and thousands of different products. There is also a massive distribution footprint in over 200 countries. Consider that Coca-Cola provides over 1.9 billion servings a day of its beverages.Although, the company has definitely not been immune from the impact of the pandemic. Of course, there has been a fall-off in business from restaurants, theaters and stadiums.But for the latest quarter, Coca-Cola's management did indicate that it appeared that the worst was over. There was also talk to accelerate the transformation efforts of the company, such as with increased investments in digital technology and even artificial intelligence.Another advantage of KO stock is the dividend. There has been an increase for 58 straight years. Safe Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com The healthcare industry definitely has many safe stocks to buy. The industry continues to grow and there are long-term secular trends like the aging of populations across the globe.One of the safest healthcare stocks is Johnson & Johnson, which has been around since 1886. The company's platform is massive and covers the main categories of healthcare:  * Consumer: These are personal, beauty, oral care and wound products. Some of the brands include Aveeno, Sudafed, Nicorette, Neutrogena, Listerine and Pepcid.  * Pharmaceuticals: They cover areas like immunology, infectious diseases, oncology and pulmonary hypertension.  * Medical Devices: The products are for surgery, eye health and orthopaedic procedures.Last month, JNJ started its first human clinical trial for a coronavirus vaccine and the plan is to have a large Phase 3 trial in September. The company has invested in its infrastructure to be able to manufacture as much as 1 billion doses for next year.Something else: With relatively stable cash flows, JNJ stock has been a solid dividend payer, with the current yield at 2.7%. The company has increased its dividend payout for 57 consecutive years. Cisco Systems (CSCO)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com The tech sector has plenty of safe stocks to buy. But there's a problem: The valuations have gotten a bit excessive.Yet there are still some interesting value plays, such as Cisco Systems. The stock recent took a hit because of the delays in sales due to the pandemic.  But the result is that the valuation is much more reasonable, with the price-earnings ratio at 16x. The dividend on CSCO stock is also at 3.3%, which is one of the highest for the tech industry.Note that the company is taking swift action to reduce its cost structure. The goal is to realize savings of $1 billion. But Cisco is also looking at ways to increase its growth.To this end, the company expects to ramp up its research and development on cloud computing as well as security solutions. CSCO is also seeing a spike in interest in Webex, which is a leading video conferencing platform. According to Cisco CEO Charles Robbins: &quot;We expect this momentum to continue, as we have begun to see the conversion of free trials into paid subscriptions.&quot; Safe Stocks to Buy: Nike (NKE)Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com In January, Nike appointed John Donahoe as CEO. Prior to this, he was the CEO of tech companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).Nike's move was another indication of why the company has been so successful -- that is, it is always looking for ways to innovate and be creative. And by selecting Donahoe, there was a clear sign that digital transformation would be critical for the future.And yes, Nike has already benefited from this expertise. When the coronavirus hit, Donahoe acted swiftly to bolster the company's e-commerce platform. The result has been that -- during the latest quarter -- there was a 75% spike in the business.True, there was still an overall drop in the sales. But the e-commerce sales did soften the blow. Besides, another key advantage for NKE stock is its highly valuable brand. Its icon swoosh is recognized across the globe and commands premium pricing. As Donahoe said on the latest earnings call: &quot;Nike's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sport continues to resonate with consumers, amid a global shift toward health and wellness.&quot; McDonald's (MCD)Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com When Ray Kroc came on board McDonald's in 1954, he had big plans. He set out to transform the restaurant industry and be the leader in the emerging fast-food category. And it did not take him long to do this.Fast forward to today: McDonald's has over 36,000 locations across more than 100 countries.Building this empire has included a variety of innovative strategies, such as with creating an efficient process for cooking food, coming up with creative menu items and keeping costs low. But the company has also been smart with its business model, such as by relying on franchises.While the pandemic has depressed sales -- which has been the case throughout the restaurant industry -- MCD has been finding ways to deal with the challenges. The company has been able to quickly make operational changes to its chain of locations, say with safety measures, new menus and contactless systems. There has also been material improvements to the speed of service for the drive-thru business. During this period, customer satisfaction has actually increased.Then again, McDonald's has the benefit of a trusted brand as well as a rock-solid balance sheet. There is also an attractive dividend. Note that the yield on MCD stock is roughly 2.4%. Safe Stocks to Buy: Verizon (VZ)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Verizon is the No. 1 mobile carrier in the United States, with 119.9 million subscribers. And even with the pandemic, the company has continued to grow its base. In the latest quarter, VZ added roughly 173,000 postpaid phone connections. Then again, for millions of people, their smartphone has become a necessity.But in the next few years, VZ should benefit from the megatrend of 5G. This technology will supercharge the speeds of mobile networks -- spurring the creation of innovative apps for consumers and businesses. Technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality and the internet of things will become more pervasive.To capitalize on this, VZ has recently acquired Blue Jeans Network, which operates a videoconferencing platform. Of course, this market has seen a surge in growth because of the pandemic. But 5G will be another important catalyst.VZ stock is currently trading at attractive levels as the price-earnings ratio is at 12.7x and the dividend is at 4%. The company also has a reasonable debt load and continues to crank out strong cash flows, which have come to nearly $16 billion for the past year.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is an advisor/board member for startups and author of various books and online courses about technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, The Robotic Process Automation Handbook and Learn Python Super Fast.

2020-08-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you wanted to examine whether heightened international scrutiny of outbound Chinese investments is about knee-jerk xenophobia as much as legitimate national security concerns, you could do worse than look at events in Australia. China Mengniu Dairy Co. and Kirin Holdings Co. will terminate the planned sale of Kirin’s Australian beverages business Lion Dairy & Drinks Pty., the companies said Tuesday. Eight months after the $A600 million ($430.4 million) sale was announced, foreign investment approval has still not been granted “and is unlikely to be forthcoming,” Kirin said in a statement.It’s hard to comprehend a sensible rationale behind blocking this deal.Lion has been foreign-owned since Japan’s Kirin took it over more than a decade ago. Mengniu isn’t a state-owned enterprise, and even if it was, pinpointing what genuine issues could crop up around Lion’s core business of producing milk, juice and beer stretches the imagination. Just 10 days before the Lion bid was announced last November, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg signed off on Mengniu’s A$1.28 billion takeover of Bellamy’s Australia Ltd., a maker of organic infant formula.For its part, Beijing hasn’t always been wide open to foreign beverage takeovers, blocking Coca-Cola Co.’s 2009 bid for a local juice company on antitrust grounds. China antagonized Australia’s drinks industry with a patently absurd anti-dumping investigation of the country’s winemakers just last week.Even so, China’s beverages industry is hardly closed off to external investment. Its breweries have long been fought over by foreign companies including SABMiller Plc, Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. and Heineken NV. Mengniu itself counts France's Danone SA and Denmark's Arla Foods Amba as major shareholders.More to the point, trade and investment diplomacy isn’t meant to be playground tit-for-tat, where Canberra punishes Kirin and Mengniu because Beijing was mean to Australia’s wine industry. If a Chinese company buying Lion from a Japanese company is a threat to the national interest (the vaguely defined core of Australia’s foreign-investment approvals regime), the government should articulate its reasons. That’s not happening. Though Frydenberg has the final say in foreign investment approvals, he hasn’t followed the usual practice of announcing and explaining his decision. Instead he’s just drawn things out long enough that the parties themselves have walked away. (In an email to Bloomberg News after Tuesday’s announcement, he said he’d previously told Mengniu the deal “would be contrary to the national interest” but didn’t elaborate further.)Given the dismal history of China’s outbound takeovers, the country’s executives might consider this more restrictive atmosphere a blessing in disguise. Fosun International Ltd. may see its investment in Cirque de Soleil wiped out, and investments in U.K. restaurant chain PizzaExpress and baggage handler Swissport International AG have similarly turned sour, Manuel Baigorri of Bloomberg News reported this week.Still, this is no way for Australia to attract foreign investors — something the country should be taking more seriously, given it has recently started running capital account deficits for the first time since the 1970s. Kirin is now stuck with a business it doesn’t want and its future will be “re-examined,” the Japanese company said Tuesday. If Mengniu, one of the world’s biggest dairy businesses, thinks it can make a better play of things but gets blocked due to politics, employees only have Frydenberg to thank if they find their jobs restructured out of existence.The unspoken backdrop to all this is the likelihood that a similar deal would have been waved through if the buyer weren’t Chinese. Diplomatic relations between Canberra and Beijing are already strained, and Asian Australians have reported hundreds of cases of racial abuse in recent months. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been at pains to stress that whatever justified issues Australia may have with the Chinese government, it will support Chinese people and Chinese Australians. At such a time, it’s doubly important that politicians draw a bright line between foreign investment bars based on solid national security grounds, and a broad-brush objection to all money coming out of China. If that hasn’t been done, even more legitimate restrictions will end up carrying the taint of prejudice.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.

Coca-Cola earned $2.92 billion, and sales totaled $8.60 billion in Q1.What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Coca-Cola posted an ROCE of 0.11%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on KOReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Coca-Cola, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Recap Coca-Cola reported Q2 earnings per share at $0.42/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.4/share.See more from Benzinga  * Understanding Coca-Cola's Unusual Options Activity  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 22, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-26,"The pandemic had a mixed impact on packaged food and beverage companies. The stay-at-home orders led to increased demand in the at-home channel. However, lower sales in on-the-go channels significantly hurt sales.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have been closely competing in the non-alcoholic beverage space for decades. Amid the current crisis, we will discuss the performance of these soda giants and use the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to see which stock offers a better investment opportunity.Coca-Cola (KO)The pandemic’s impact on Coca-Cola’s second-quarter performance was so immense that the company posted its largest revenue decline in at least 30 years (as per CNBC). The second-quarter revenue fell 28% Y/Y to $7.2 billion, while organic revenue plunged 26%.Global unit case volume dropped 16% due to a steep decline in the volumes in away-from-home channels, like restaurants, which account for over 50% of the company’s top line. The second-quarter adjusted EPS fell 33% Y/Y to $0.42.Prior to COVID, Coca-Cola’s soda volumes were improving due to its efforts to offer smaller packages and better beverage choices like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. But, the pandemic hurt the category and sparkling soft drinks volumes were down 12% in the second quarter with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar declining 4%.The pandemic did not spare other categories too. Tea and coffee volumes fell 31% and volumes of water, enhanced water and sports drinks were down 24%. Also, volumes of juice, dairy and plant beverages tanked 20% even as the demand for Fairlife milk and Simply juices was strong in North America.Coca-Cola has been focusing on the non-soda categories as consumers have been shifting from sugary, soda drinks to healthier options. It has been expanding its non-soda portfolio through innovation and several acquisitions, including Britain’s COSTA coffee.Coca-Cola believes that the worst might have been over in the second quarter based on improvement in the away-from-home channels as lockdown restrictions have started easing. Also, there is sustained demand in the at-home consumption. The company’s worldwide unit case volume declined by mid-single digits in July (month-to-date as of July 21) compared to a 10% decline in June and 25% in April.Coca-Cola intends to streamline its beverage portfolio by focusing on fewer but bigger and stronger brands. Of the company’s 400 master brands, more than 50% are single-country brands and these generate only 2% of the overall revenue. The company wants to get rid of such brands and direct its resources to the popular ones. (See KO stock analysis on TipRanks)Coca-Cola stock has declined 13% year-to-date in 2020. The average price target of $54.67 reflects an upside of about 14% over the coming 12-months. Despite the performance in the first half, Wall Street has a Strong Buy consensus for Coca-Cola based on 8 Buys and 1 Hold rating.On July 22, Morgan Stanley research analyst Dara Mohsenian upgraded Coca-Cola stock from Hold to Buy with a price target of $54. The analyst believes that the second-quarter was the bottom and there is sequential top line improvement ahead. On August 17, Mohsenian reiterated his Buy rating and said that the stock’s valuation is compelling.PepsiCo (PEP)PepsiCo has also been impacted by the current crisis. However, the company’s snack food business has helped its resilience despite several challenges. PepsiCo’s second-quarter revenue declined 3.1% Y/Y to $15.9 billion, while organic revenue was down 0.3%. The company’s adjusted EPS fell 14.3% to $1.32.Consumers spent more time at home and avoided eating out. This drove the demand for PepsiCo’s food business. PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay North America business grew 7% and in fact, the company gained market share in salty, savory and macro-snacks. Revenue from Quaker Foods North America surged 23%.In contrast, revenue from the PepsiCo Beverages North America segment declined 7% due to lower sales in convenience and gas and foodservice channels. Overall, the segment’s soda volumes fell 10% and non-soda volumes were down 8%. On the brighter side, the company gained market share in ready-to-drink coffee, tea and enhanced water. Also, Pepsi Zero Sugar and Bubly delivered double-digit growth.PepsiCo’s revenue from Latin America and Europe declined 17% and 9%, while revenue from Africa, Middle East and South Asia fell 1%.Meanwhile, PepsiCo’s revenue from the Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China region surged 10% due to higher pricing and strong snacks volume growth, especially in China and Indonesia, partially offset by lower beverage volumes.PepsiCo is seeking growth in the energy drinks space through its Rockstar acquisition and distribution of VPX Sports’ Bang energy drinks. It is also enhancing its portfolio of better beverage and food options. PepsiCo aims to ensure that over 67% of its beverage volumes don’t have more than 100 calories from added sugar per 12 ounces by 2025. It is also planning to cut down salt and saturated fat levels in its food offerings.PepsiCo’s second-quarter results prompted Guggenheim analyst Laurent Grandet to raise his price target to $151 from $148. The analyst feels that PepsiCo’s recent results indicate that it is among the least impacted of beverage peers during the pandemic due to its large snacks and at-home food exposure.PepsiCo has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus based on 7 buys and 5 holds. A 12-month average price target of $145.58 indicates a 6% possible upside in the stock. PepsiCo stock has risen 0.7% year-to-date.Keeping in view the recovery in several markets, PepsiCo predicts low-single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. (See PEP stock analysis on TipRanks)The better beverage stockCoca-Cola and PepsiCo are often preferred for their steady dividends. Coca-Cola has hiked its dividends for 58 consecutive years while PepsiCo has raised its dividends for 48 years. Coca-Cola has a higher dividend yield of about 3.5% compared to PepsiCo’s 3.0%.PepsiCo’s exposure to snack foods gives it an edge over Coca-Cola. PepsiCo’s second-quarter performance and year-to-date stock movement are better than Coca-Cola. But keeping in view the upside potential over the next 12 months, lower valuation and the Street consensus, Coca-Cola looks to be a better bet.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. is offering early-departure packages to almost 40% of its North American workforce -- a sign the beverage giant is being hit hard by the ongoing shutdown of soft-drink friendly venues like movie theaters, bars and stadiums.Plans to reorganize the business and cut costs have been in the works for some time as consumer preferences shift away from sugary carbonated drinks, analysts said. But unlike its major competitor, PepsiCo Inc., which has been boosted by its snack and breakfast food products during the pandemic, Coca-Cola is being weighed down by its dependence on sales in public spaces.“They are more affected by the shutdown than other beverage companies,” said Laurent Grandet, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. “They have been thinking about this for months, but Covid may have accelerated it.”The shares rose 2.3% to $49.34 at 1:56 p.m. in New York. They had dropped 13% this year through Thursday’s close, compared with 7.9% gain from S&P 500 Index and Pepsi’s 1.3% advance.About 4,000 Coca-Cola employees in North America will be offered packages with benefits if they agree to leave, the Atlanta-based soda maker said in a statement Friday. A similar program will follow in other countries and there will also be an unspecified number of involuntary layoffs, the company said. The company had about 86,000 employees worldwide and 10,800 at the end of last year.RestructuringCoca-Cola is also creating new operating units for regional and local operations that will work with category-specific teams under the the company’s marketing leadership. The company will streamline its business units to nine from 17, and expects the severance programs to result in expenses of $350 million to $550 million.Under the moves, the Coca-Cola brand will be separated from the sparkling flavors business, while coffee and tea products will be combined with hydration and sports drinks. It will also create an emerging categories segment. This will include products like the recently-announced Topo Chico alcoholic seltzer, Grandet said. With unsweetened sparkling beverages gaining ground and soft drinks and juice losing favor, Coca-Cola has vowed to become a “total beverage company.” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey has acknowledged, however, that the company was slow to act on the popularity of sparkling water.At the same time, away-from-home channels represent about half of the company’s revenue -- and it’s not clear how the company will compensate for their disappearance. Quincey said in an earnings call last month that he expected the global economy to take two or three years to recover. He added the second quarter was expected to be the most difficult period for the company.Large companies across sectors have announced tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks after economies emerged from shutdowns to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, from global airlines to Boeing Co. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.On Friday, MGM Resorts International announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees, or more than one-quarter of its pre-pandemic U.S. workforce, due to the slow recovery of some casino markets.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Coca-Cola Offers 4,000 North America Buyouts; Job Cuts to Follow"

2020-08-28,"Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) posted Q2 earnings of $2.19 billion, an increase from Q1 of 24.93%. Sales dropped to $7.15 billion, a 16.87% decrease between quarters. In Q1, Coca-Cola earned $2.92 billion, and total sales reached $8.60 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Coca-Cola's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. In Q2, Coca-Cola posted an ROCE of 0.11%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on KOROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Coca-Cola is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Coca-Cola, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q2 Earnings Insight Coca-Cola reported Q2 earnings per share at $0.42/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.4/share.See more from Benzinga  * ROCE Insights For Coca-Cola  * Understanding Coca-Cola's Unusual Options Activity  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-03,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average, long the key index of the stock market’s overall movements and health, has been holding above 28,000 for two weeks now. The index hasn’t seen these levels since late February – it’s rise now is being taken as an indicator that the Dow is moving to catch up with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ, both of which are regularly setting new record levels.With the Dow clearly back on an upward trajectory, now is the time to start looking at the component stocks; after all, an index is nothing more than the sum of its parts, and while it maybe useful as an analytical tool, those parts have something to say, too.So now let’s tell a tale of three stocks on the Dow, showing how some parts can move up, and others down, while the index as a whole gains. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we lined up the three alongside each other to get the lowdown on what the near-term holds for these Dow players.Coca-Cola Company (KO)The first stock on our list, Coca Cola, is a long-time favorite of investing great Warren Buffett. Buffett is not shy about his opinions, and his love for Coke, as an investment and a product, is well documented. He has said of the latter, If I eat 2700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola.”Regarding Coke as an investment, however, Buffett’s insight is keen: “No business has ever failed with happy customers… and you’re selling happiness.” Coca Cola has a great brand built up around its flagship drink, one that it has used to promote a much wider portfolio of products. The company makes and distributes over 350 different brands in 200 countries around the world. Late last month, Coke announced that it will be streamlining its management structure, to improve efficiency during and beyond the pandemic.The COVID pandemic, however, has hit Coke hard. Social lockdowns kept customers home and stores closed, while trade and restrictions disrupted both supply and distribution chains. It was a retailer’s nightmare. EPS managed to beat forecasts in Q1, but fell off 33% in Q2. Since Q4 of last year, revenue has fallen sequentially from $9.1 billion to $8.6 billion to $7.2 billion.Even during the pandemic, Coke kept up its regular dividend payments. The company next declared payment date is October 1, which will be the third payment at the current level of 41 cents per common share. Coke has an 11-year history of gradually raising the dividend, which is currently yielding 3.3%.Deutsche Bank analyst Steve Powers sees a clear path forward for Coke. He writes, “Management changes give us greater confidence in KO's ability to exit the current pandemic in a stronger position than from which it entered. If successful, we see them helping to enable significant cost efficiencies already directionally envisioned in DB estimates, while at the same time driving quicker decision-making and less overlap/redundancy with local bottling operations… this new organizational structure should also allow KO to better unlock and uncover new revenue opportunities, particularly in its less scaled beverage categories…”In line with his optimism, Powers rates KO stock a Buy. Meanwhile, his $55 price target suggests a 7.5% upside growth from current levels. (To watch Powers’ track record, click here)Overall, with 10 analyst reviews, including 9 Buys and a single Hold, KO has a Strong Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This Dow standard is currently selling for $51.19, and the average price target of $54.7 implies a 7% upside. (See KO stock analysis on TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Next on our list is UnitedHealth, the world’s largest provider of health insurance policies. UNH brings in more than $240 billion in annual revenues and boasts a market cap of $304 billion. With over 130 million customers signed up around the world, UnitedHealth has the customer base and the deep pockets to weather the pandemic. United Health’s Q2 results show how the company has met the challenges of COVID-19. EPS surged 91%, to $7.12, on $62 billion in revenue. The company credited a historically low medical loss ratio of 70% for the big jump in earnings, and maintained its full-year guidance of $16.25 to $16.55 per share.Looking ahead, UNH warns that Q3 may see a rise in business costs. Paradoxically, this will come from an increase in business. As lockdown and distancing policies ease, the company predicts that more customers will catch up on deferred medical treatments, resulting in an increase of claims to be paid.Frank Morgan, 5-star analyst with RBC, was impressed with UNH’s second quarter: “The quarter dramatically exceeded Street expectations and were within range of our estimate... With inpatient, outpatient, physician office, pharmaceutical, and other activity continuing to show signs of recovery in 2H20, mgmt maintained FY20 guidance, however we believe this could prove conservative.”In line with those comments, Morgan rates UNH stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $384 price target. The target implies a 20% upside for the coming year. (To watch Morgan’s track record, click here)UnitedHealth’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 17 reviews, breaking down to 15 Buys and just 2 Holds. The shares are selling for $321.58, and the average price target of $350.35 suggests room for a 9% upside in the next 12 months. (See UNH stock analysis on TipRanks)American Express (AXP)The last stock on our Dow list, American Express, has a less bullish outlook. Amex, based in New York City, is one of the world’s best-known financial service providers, and its credit cards, charge cards, and travelers’ checks have long been ubiquitous. The company’s marketing reflects this, and until 2005 the company’s charge-card slogan was ‘Don’t leave home without it.’The pandemic, however, by reducing commerce, took a heavy toll on the company. Quarterly revenues have slid almost 25% since the start of the year, and are down to $6.1 billion. EPS fell a dramatic 85% in Q2, dropping from $1.98 per share to just 29 cents. Yet, that number was far better than the 13-cent EPS forecast.Falling revenues, sliding earnings, and a share price that has yet to recover – all of these underly the recent caution that Wall Street is expressing on Amex. Writing for Compass Point, William Ryan says, “In 2021, we are still expecting a slower recovery at AXP relative to other issuers as T&E spending trends take longer to recover than other categories… Shares of AXP have historically traded between 12x-16x, and we believe it is fair to value the company on the lower end of this range due to the disproportionate impact that lower T&E spending is having on AXP relative to other issuers… We believe revenue will remain suppressed as spending volume stays at lower levels in the near future until the environment is more conducive for T&E to recover.”Ryan rates AXP shares as Neutral (i.e. Hold), and his $85 price target, suggesting a 20.5% downside to the stock for the coming year, indicates just how little confidence he has. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)Ryan’s caution is typical. Of the 19 analyst reviews on this stock, 11 are Hold and 3 are Sell, against 5 Buys. The average share price, at $102, suggests a 5% downside from the current share price of $107.28.

2020-09-04,"What a stellar year 2020 has been so far for the owners of Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) stock. The novel coronavirus means we live in an increasingly interconnected world where businesses need to digitally communicate with their clients non-stop. A forerunner in the communication platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) sector, Twilio benefited from that trend and Twilio stock is up around 145% year-to-date.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com Investors now wonder what they can expect from cloud-based communications tools specialist Twilio in the final stretch of the year.In the long-run, I expect the increased demand in technology to lead to more sales for the cloud communications platform.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, there is likely to be profit-taking in Twilio stock in the near-future, which may push the shares toward $225. How Q2 Results CameTwilio's cloud communications platform helps businesses improve their digital interactions with their customers. Several of its prominent clients include American Red Cross, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), Mercado Libre (NASDAQ:MELI), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Yelp (NASDAQ:YELP).  * 10 Blue-Chip Stocks Ideal for Any InvestorEarlier in August, San Francisco-based Twilio reported second-quarter results that exceeded the Street's estimates. Total revenue was $400.8 million, up 46% year-over-year. It delivered net income of $9.5 million, or 71 cents per share.The company has more than 200,000 active customer accounts, up 24% YOY. CEO Jeff Lawson said, &quot;Organizations in nearly every industry are turning to Twilio as they identify new ways to communicate with their customers and stakeholders. We are just scratching the surface of this huge opportunity, and we believe the solutions being built today using our customer engagement platform will be the standard for digital engagement in the future.&quot;Following the release of the quarterly results, Twilio stock initially headed lower, possibly on light EPS guidance as well as profit-taking. However, in the second half of August, it recovered most of that loss. Now TWLO shares are hovering around $270. High Valuation Is a Concern for Twilio StockMany analysts agree that Twilio's best days are possibly ahead. However, Wall Street is also getting concerned about the rich valuation levels of Twilio stock.Investors may use different metrics to gauge the relative value of companies in different industries. One metric is price-sales (P/S) ratio. The P/S ratio of TWLO stock is over 27.4. Analysts prefer a low P/S ratio, ideally below 1. However, a P/S ratio between 1 and 2 is more common. To put the metric into perspective, the S&P 500 index's average P?S is 2.3.Another way to analyze a stock's valuation is to compare its valuation to that of other companies in similar industries or segments. In general, SaaS stocks are richly valued. Our readers may be interested to know that the P/S ratio for the cloud computing giant Salesforce.com (NASDAQ:CRM) is 13.1, while Veeva (NASDAQ:VEEV) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), two other SaaS stocks, have P/S ratios of about 36.5 and 14.1, respectively.Although the P/S ratio of TWLO stock is high, investors should also remember this is only one of many valuation metrics. Moreover, the metric does not take into account the profitability or costs of Twilio.Twilio is also facing increased competition on multiple fronts from several enterprise software companies, including Salesforce.com and Bandwidth (NASDAQ:BAND).  The digital communications revolution is here to stay, but the space TWLO operates in is fiercely competitive. Where TWLO Stock is NowTwilio is regarded as a high-growth disruptor. It went public in June 2016 at an opening price of $23.99. By September 2016, the price of Twilio stock was hovering around $70. The shares started 2020 just shy of $100.By mid-March, TWLO shares were below $70. Now they are around $236. Investors who follow short-term technical charts will be interested to know that Twilio stock is now in overbought territory. It is possible that the recent volatility in tech shares will lead to further profit-taking soon.TWLO is both a growth and a speculative stock. Therefore, in the coming weeks, I expect Twilio to be a battleground between investors and traders. While long-term investors would like to see TWLO stock exceed and stay over $275,  traders are likely to keep it between $225 and $250.As long as Twilio stock remains in a long-term uptrend, investors may continue to buy it on dips. However, if prolonged profit-taking sends the shares below $225, the validity of the long-term uptrend would need to be reevaluated. And in the wake of such a decline, it may be some months before TWLO stock price sets fresh records. Bottom LineIn the coming quarters, Twilio's revenue growth is likely to continue. As a result, the leading provider of in-app communication solutions is setting the bar quite high for its next earnings report. Any sign that Twilio's growth outlook is not as strong as expected in Q3 or Q4 may be enough to spook investors, sending the share price lower.Those investors who already own Twilio stock may consider taking some money off the table or hedging their positions. Such a hedge would limit their downside risk in the event the market drops or if the bullish thesis on TWLO stock ends up being wrong.As for hedging strategies, covered calls or put spreads with Oct. 16 expiration dates could be appropriate. Straight purchases of put options are likely to be expensive due to heightened volatility in tech shares. Investors who choose this route can reevaluate their long positions around the expiry of options.Well-performing stocks tend to keep on winning, and the recent strength of TWLO shares might be a good indication that within three or four years, investors who buy Twilio stock on weakness are likely to be rewarded handsomely.On the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.​The author has worked in investment management for over two decades in the U.S. and U.K. In addition to formal higher education in the field, she has also completed all 3 levels of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) examination.

2020-09-14,"Wall Street is a constant tug of war between optimists and pessimists or as industry parlance has it – the struggle of bulls vs. bears.  Deutsche Bank analyst Stephen Powers considers both cases for fizzy drinks giant Coca-Cola (KO).The last few weeks have seen a stream of updates from the iconic beverage maker as it embarks on a series of restructuring initiatives to improve overall operations.Compared to the present “more vertically and geographically siloed” set up in which business unit leaders report to their respective group presidents, the new system will feature all operating unit leaders reporting directly to President & COO Brian Smith, thereby improving communication and decision making across the organization’s global network.The series of announcements have opened debates amongst investors. The bears have questioned “the pacing of sequential improvement” and have viewed the restructuring announcements as “a knee-jerk reaction to persistent away-from home headwinds.” At the other end of the scale, the bulls have taken a more optimistic view of the “sequential improvement prospects,” and believe the reshuffling is “further validation that the company will emerge from current COVID-19 conditions stronger and more profitable.”So, who does Powers side with?“For our part,” the 4-star analyst said, “We continue to side with the bulls--viewing quarter-to-date commentary from KO and its bottling partners as generally validating of go-forward demand prospects, and seeing KO's restructuring as a welcome acceleration of promising change that was already afoot within the Coke System pre-pandemic.”Powers also notes that according to the company and its bottling partners, due to the coronavirus’ hit “calendar 2Q20 is likely to reflect the most adverse impact on revenue generation.”Looking ahead to a post-pandemic climate, the analyst believes KO represents “an underappreciated play on global reopening and recovery over the next 12+ months.”Accordingly, Powers reiterated a Buy rating on KO shares along with a $55 price target. Should the figure be met, investors could be pocketing a 8% gain. (To watch Powers’ track record, click here)There is widespread agreement amongst Powers’ colleagues. Based on 9 buys and 1 Hold, Coca-Cola has a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $54.7, the average price target comes in just under Powers’, and could provide returns of ~8% over the coming months.

2020-09-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Michael R. Strain continues to believe in Milton Friedman’s doctrine and argues it has been misunderstood by critics. Read his column here.In the summer of 1982, when I was 29, I was given a front-row seat as Milton Friedman’s famous dictum began to be put into practice.I had recently joined the staff of Texas Monthly, where my first assignment was to profile a man I’d never heard of, T. Boone Pickens Jr., the founder and chief executive officer of Mesa Petroleum in Amarillo, Texas. My timing was spectacular: Pickens was secretly preparing his first hostile takeover attempt. Soon after I embarked on the story, his takeover bid became public, at which point he invited me to New York to sit in his hotel suite and watch him try to pull it off.Not surprisingly, I became caught up in the excitement of the hostile bid, which was full of dramatic twists and turns. A business newbie, I also absorbed the doctrine that was its rationale. It was Friedman’s dictum, the one he had laid out 50 years ago in the New York Times Magazine: The responsibility of corporate executives, he wrote, “is to conduct the business in accordance with [shareholders’] desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible ... .”(1) The idea that businesses had social responsibilities, he added, was deeply wrongheaded. In academia, Michael Jensen was the most prominent carrier of the Friedman torch; the landmark 1976 paper he wrote with William Meckling,(2) Theory of the Firm, argued that executives spent too much time thinking about “the physical appointments of the office, the attractiveness of the office staff, the level of employee discipline, the kind and amount of charitable contributions” and not nearly enough time thinking about maximizing profits for shareholders. CEOs needed to start aligning their interests with those of shareholders, Jensen and Meckling wrote.Out in the field, if we can call it that, men like Pickens, Carl Icahn, Ron Perelman and a few dozen others — corporate raiders, they were labeled — used this same argument to justify their hostile takeover attempts. In his suite that summer, Pickens never tired of telling me (and anyone else within hearing distance) how the shareholders owned the company, how the sole job of a CEO was to make money for shareholders and how terrible it was that CEOs owned so little stock in their own companies.Although corporate executives resisted the raiders at first, they eventually came around, especially once they realized that stock options could make them rich if the company’s share price rose. (And since this was the 1980s bull market, stocks did pretty much nothing else.) Once it went mainstream, Friedman’s doctrine became known as “maximizing shareholder value.”It wasn’t just CEOs who started to preach shareholder value — so did everyone else in the business world. Wall Street became extremely impatient if a company spent “too much” on research and development, or if it failed to lay off workers quickly enough during any kind of downturn. Newly minted MBAs wanted to work for jazzy companies with fast-rising stocks. When I was at Fortune magazine in the late 1990s, our favorite CEO coverboys were those who combined managerial skill with eye-popping stocks, like Roberto Goizueta at Coca-Cola Co. and Jack Welch at General Electric. It always bothered me that CEOs were now making such incredible sums — and that the gap between their compensation and that of the average worker was getting wider by the year. But aside from that, I drank the Kool-Aid, too.In his book “Transaction Man,” Nicholas Lemann notes that around the turn of the century, Jensen began to doubt that shareholder value was the panacea he had once thought it to be. Among the events that shook his faith were the scandals that rocked the country in the early 2000s: “the collapse of such companies as Enron, WorldCom and Nortel, which had used fraudulent accounting to make themselves look far more successful than they were.”That’s when I began to change my mind, too. Enron executives were obsessed with the company’s stock price — they were all big shareholders, after all — and did whatever they needed to beat Wall Street’s quarterly expectations. Their moves included posting profits that never existed and using an off-balance-sheet special purpose entity secretly controlled by the company’s chief financial officer to manipulate earnings, all in the name of maximizing shareholder value.As income inequality became a more obvious problem, so did the realization that at least some of it — and maybe a lot of it — could be attributed to maximizing shareholder value. It wasn’t just that CEOs were getting richer; it was also that employees were getting poorer. There were large corporations — healthy companies that made a lot of money — that paid its lowest level employees so little they needed government assistance. How did it make sense to reward shareholders at the expense of employees?Pharmaceutical companies had long had a culture of indifference toward the stock market. But the 1990s ushered in the era of blockbuster drugs, and Big Pharma became as caught up in shareholder value as most other sectors. The result was the unstoppable rise in drug prices that have made drugs unaffordable to many patients who need them.Were the fatal mistakes Boeing Co. made with the 737 Max — which led to 346 deaths and the grounding of the plane by regulators — the result of trying to maximize shareholder value? Yes. Was the implosion a few years ago of Valeant Pharmaceuticals Ltd. — a company that rolled up other pharma companies, cut their R&D staff and jacked up the price of their drugs — the result of trying to maximize shareholder value? Yes again. There are plenty of other examples.“Maximizing shareholder value has meant doing whatever is necessary to boost the share price this quarter and the next,” the Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein wrote last year. He continued:Over the years, it has been used to justify bamboozling customers, squeezing workers and suppliers, avoiding taxes and lavishing stock options on executives. Most of what people find so distasteful about American capitalism — the ruthlessness, the greed, the inequality — has its roots in this misguided notion about what business is all about.In 1997, the Business Roundtable, embracing Friedman, put out a mission statement saying that “maximizing value for shareholders” should be the sole purpose of a corporation. Last year, it issued a new mission statement.“While each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,” the business lobby said. Stakeholders included not only shareholders but also employees, customers and communities. “We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.”We’re in a pandemic now. Millions of Americans are out of work. Tens of thousands of small businesses have closed. Millions more Americans are trying to work from home while juggling child care and remote learning. One would be hard pressed to think of a time when quarterly profits ought to matter less. What does it matter if the stock price is up or down if we are on the precipice of a depression? Who cares if a company beat its quarterly estimates?Yet big companies like Ford, Coke and AT&T are laying off workers, exacerbating the country’s pain. It appears that companies aren’t yet ready to embrace the Business Roundtable’s message, not even during a terrible time such as the one we’re in now. Old habits die hard.I have asked the question before, but it’s worth asking again: What is an economy for? It’s not simply to shovel profits to shareholders. The purpose of an economy is to allow people to prosper. In the end, Friedman’s doctrine has warped our understanding about the people an economy is supposed to serve. It’s not just shareholders. It’s all of us.(1) The rest of the sentence reads: “…while conforming to their basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.”(2) Both men taught at the University of Rochester’s Graduate School of Management.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

There are times to be &quot;risk-on&quot; and there are times to be &quot;risk-off.&quot; When investors flock to the latter, they often look for companies with no debt.That doesn't mean these stocks won't fluctuate with the overall market. But there is a level of comfort in owning stocks with financial stability.Look back at how most individual stocks performed in March. The market threw a tantrum and nearly every name was punished. But those that were punished the most are those with the shakiest financials.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsPlus, who wants to own a stock with poor financial positioning? There's a reason people say &quot;cash is king.&quot;  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now Here are 7 companies with no debt you need to know about:  * Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  * Pinterest (NYSE:PINS)  * Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST)  * DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG)  * Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU)  * Progyny (NASDAQ:PGNY)  * Fastly (NYSE:FSLY)At the end of the day, the companies with the biggest bank accounts have the most flexibility, and can better withstand long economic disruptions. They can lean on M&A, taking investments stakes in other companies and outmuscling their debt-ridden peers. Companies With No Debt: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Rarely do you see a balance sheet like that of Intuitive Surgical, making it a great candidates to kick off our list of stocks with no debt.The company has $10.1 billion in total assets with just $1.3 billion in total liabilities. A robust balance sheet may boast a five-to-one ratio between total assets and total liabilities, but there aren't many companies in that category. Intuitive Surgical's asset-to-liability ratio sits at nearly 10.Of those assets, almost $4.5 billion is held in cash. Not only does that give the company flexibility in a time of uncertainty, it should also give investors relief knowing that it will not suffer a liquidity event. The downside to Intuitive Surgical is this year's growth estimates. Analysts expect sales and earnings to decline this year, before snapping back to very strong results in 2021.Known mostly for its Da Vinci Device, the health field is one that will continue to grow and innovate over time. Admittedly, the novel coronavirus has disrupted the medical industry, but ultimately procedures will go on.As CEO Gary Guthart said in the most recent earnings report, &quot;We've seen hospitals with adequate supplies of staff, PPE and physical resources returned to above 90% of pre-COVID procedure run rates over a few months period.&quot; Pinterest (PINS)Source: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com Pinterest is one of my favorite names on this list. Considered a social media stock, it's not just the conventional social online platform we've come to know.The company is one of the most efficient at turning ad dollars into revenue, something that makes Pinterest a very lucrative platform for businesses. That's also helped to fuel its top-line growth. Despite the slowdown from the novel coronavirus, Pinterest still found a way to grow sales last quarter. Analysts are forecasting more than 26% growth for the year despite the economic uncertainty.But the real beauty lies in the way management handles its finances. Pinterest is expected to swing to profitability this year, from roughly break-even operations in 2019. The company is also free cash flow positive on a trailing basis.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now With no debt, $1.7 billion in cash and plenty of long-term growth potential, Pinterest is a stock to own for long-term investors. Monster Beverage (MNST)Source: Domagoj Kovacic / Shutterstock.com Everyone looks to tech when thinking about the biggest long-term winners. Few think of Monster Beverage.While shares are up modestly over the past few years, this stock has been a beast over the long term. Monster Beverage is up 942% over the last 10 years and an unimaginable 80,000% over the last 20 years.Obviously we're not going to get those returns again, but that doesn't make Monster one to avoid. The stock is forecast to have steady growth in 2020 and 2021&#92;. Analysts expect 7% sales growth this year and an acceleration to 10.7% growth next year. For earnings, estimates call for 10.3% and 13.3% growth this year and next year, respectively.On top of it, the balance sheet is enviable. Monster boasts $5.15 billion in total assets, more than five-fold the $979 million it holds in total liabilities. Of course, it's a stock with no debt.Finally, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) acquired a 16.7% stake in the company in 2015. That stake has climbed to almost 20% thanks to Monster's buybacks. Perhaps Coca-Cola is content with its stake -- but perhaps it will be interested in an eventual takeover too. DraftKings (DKNG)Source: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com DraftKings is the youngest public company on the list. The company went public via a SPAC offering earlier this year and it has been on fire ever since.While newness doesn't automatically equate to riskiness, investors have to size up everything about DraftKings.Its positives include the secular trend toward legalizing online gaming and sports gambling. It has surprisingly solid growth given the massive disruption we've seen in the world this year.DraftKings is also a play on the economy reopening and a return to sports. The latter catalyst is also a risk, though.  Should sports leagues postpone again and/or should the economy begin to lock down, DraftKings could find itself on the wrong side of the bet.Further, as of the most recent quarter, the company was not cash flow positive, nor is profitable yet.  That said, some of those concerns are alleviated when considering the current circumstances. That includes realizing that the prior quarter came off the one of the quietest sporting periods in decades.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now Further, one must realize that DraftKings can bide its time through the unrest. With minimal cash burn, $1.2 billion in cash and no debt, there's no need to worry about a liquidity situation. Lululemon Athletica (LULU)Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com Lululemon Athletica probably isn't a name many investors expected on this list. Years ago, the retailer had trouble finding the sweet spot. However, that's all changed as Lululemon is now a premiere retailer on Wall Street. The company has strong growth, in-demand products and, naturally, a robust balance sheet.The company's deep liquidity will allow it to restart its buyback plan, a move the retailer announced on September 22. Further, that liquidity allowed Lululemon to scoop up Mirror for $500 million earlier this year. The startup is an in-home fitness company and should help Lululemon expand into a new growth avenue.While that deal may slightly add to company debt, it's not something investors will need to worry about.  At a time where retailers are dropping like flies and under severe pressure due to the coronavirus, Lululemon continues to thrive. Aside from its balance sheet strength, it continues to boast strong growth.Lululemon also continues to see direct-to-consumer (DTC) strength. DTC sales were up 157% year-over-year last quarter, representing more than 60% of all revenue. Progyny (PGNY)Source: Shutterstock A rarely discussed name, Progyny may be a stock investors want to keep on their radar.The company focuses its work on infertility, a trend that has been growing for quite some time now. That has translated to frustrated couples who have difficulty conceiving. That's where Progyny comes in to help -- and it's also where it has found solid growth.Coronavirus-related costs have weighed on Progyny this year, which is expected to earn just 12 cents per share this year. That's only up a penny from 11 cents per share in 2019. However, estimates call for a big-time acceleration in 2021, with more than 230% earnings growth to 40 cents per share.Further, revenue growth is no joke. Estimates call for almost 50% growth this year followed by 60% growth in 2021. Progyny is free-cash flow positive over the trailing 12 months, is profitable and has no debt.  * 7 Hot Stocks to Buy on Robinhood Now This stock has had its ups and downs, falling almost 60% from its February high to the March low. However, the dip gives investors an opportunity to take a closer look at this name. Fastly (FSLY)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Let me preface this by saying that Fastly does technically have some debt. However it's very minute compared with its market cap and cash position.Fastly, a recent Wall Street darling, has $5.2 million in current debt and long-term debt of just $20.1 million. $25.3 million in combined debt vs. $385 million in cash and a market cap pushing $10 billion is nothing.Detractors will say that Fastly is just an edge-computing company in a commoditized market. Bulls would argue that it offers a superior product compared to its peers. Thanks to its superb management, Fastly is carving out a dominant position in an area that's rapidly becoming important in our Covid-19 world.As traffic grows and as data demand increases, more and more companies are moving to the edge. With the company's latest acquisition of Signal Science, it's also making a push into cybersecurity. This should open up another growth avenue for the company, driving long-term value. The cash and stock deal should also prevent a notable strain on the balance sheet.While Fastly stock may be a bit pricey due to its monstrous run, shares should still be primed for more upside in the future. The recent demand from increased internet and cloud use isn't going to subside overnight -- or in some bulls' estimates, at all.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held long positions in PINS and FSLY.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2020-09-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Trade is looking even bleaker for businesses near London’s Liverpool Street station now that Boris Johnson is urging people to work from home for another six months.Hipster kebab seller Butcher & Bab reopened two weeks ago in the hope of benefiting from a large-scale return to work this autumn, but sales have been down 65% from Monday through Wednesday and almost 80% on Thursdays and Fridays. The nearby Beauty Box is doing half the number of treatments as before the pandemic. And while Japanese curry restaurant Donburi saw demand pick up earlier in September, it fell away quickly last week after the new work-from-home directive.Butcher & Bab co-founder Bijan Morvaridi summed it up: “The business is a shadow of what it was.”London reflects the challenges facing city centers around the U.K. but also in France, Spain and Ireland where various local lockdown orders are curbing pub hours and restricting the number of people who can meet up to socialize.The extended absence of nine-to-fivers from city office blocks and transport hubs spells potential catastrophe for those that serve them, from coffee and sandwich shops to convenience stores, gyms and hairdressers. By March, it will have been a year since this large-scale work-from-home experiment began.In the U.K., retailers and restaurants are scrambling to slash costs and adapt in order to to cope with the drop-off in business. Britain’s ubiquitous sandwich, soup and coffee chain Pret a Manger has announced the closure of 30 stores and the loss of close to 3,000 jobs. Costa Coffee, owned by Coca-Cola Co. could cut up to 1,650  roles. Faced with earlier closing times, restaurants and bars are experimenting with opening earlier to make ends meet.For businesses that are still closed, particularly those in city centers, the new restrictions mean they may never restart operations again, which could potentially lead to a spike in the number of vacant units. Only some 72% of shops and 69% of leisure locations in England have reopened, according to the Local Data Company. Businesses are already innovating to keep customers loyal wherever they are. Pret a Manger started a new coffee subscription service that got 16,500 signups on the first day. For 20 pounds a month, subscribers get up to five barista-prepared drinks a day from any location, be it in the City or their home office.Hair and beauty company Blow Ltd. was about to reopen its Covent Garden salon when the new work-from-home advice came. It’s focusing on its at-home mobile beauty offerings, which have rocketed, adding new services such as hair color to tackle those lockdown roots and expanding hair cutting to men and children so the whole family can get their hair done in one visit.Some groups, including healthy fast-food chain Leon and baker Greggs Plc, best known for its sausage rolls, are already selling their products in supermarkets. More could follow. Pret, which is owned by JAB Holding Co., will start selling bags of coffee in Waitrose Ltd. stores next month and it’s planning a line of prepackaged food in partnership with other retailers in the new year. These are smart moves. One-stop grocers are set to be big beneficiaries of remote employment, as Brits brew their own espressos and make their own lunch. But bags of coffee are likely to be less profitable than single skinny lattes.Over the longer term, relocating may be one option for city-center businesses. New co-working spaces are springing up in suburbs to accommodate lonely home-based employees. Retailers and restaurants close by may thrive.  Office-heavy districts such as the City of London may also be repurposed over time into greener spaces with a wider variety of shops and leisure activities, reckons Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sue Munden. Canary Wharf is a good example of how this could work. While its office buildings may be largely empty, the area has been enjoying strong weekend trade because it has a wide range of retailers that also serve a big residential population.Such developments are still a long way off, however. While big established consumer brands have deep enough pockets to get through this crisis, smaller rivals will be less able to cope with the transition. If things don’t improve, Butcher & Bab may have to consider moving to a more residential area. Doing so would be a difficult decision given it’s always served the central London lunchtime market since starting out as a street food business. “We know what it was like before,” Morvaridi told me. “It’s going to be really hard to give that up. But how long do you keep flogging a dead horse for? It’s tough. It’s demoralizing.”This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

2020-09-28,"(Bloomberg) -- More than thirty of the largest U.S. companies have agreed to new disclosures of previously private race, gender and ethnicity workforce data as part of a push by the New York City comptroller and three city retirement funds.Amazon.com Inc., General Motors Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among 34 companies that have agreed to share the regulatory filing when they report new numbers next year, Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a statement Monday. Morgan Stanley, PepsiCo Inc., and Coca-Cola Co. have also promised data, the comptroller said. More than a dozen S&P 100 companies already release the detailed form but they are the exception, not the rule.The initiative is part of a broader push to compel workforce transparency at companies that have made explicit statements of support for equality after broad protest of the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and disproportionate deaths of minorities from Covid-19. Two other groups were formed earlier this month to ensure all public companies have at least one Black director.The New York initiative began in July and is being pressed by the city’s Employees’ Retirement System, Teachers Retirement System, and Board of Education Retirement System. The comptroller and funds targeted 67 companies that made statements of support for reform after the unrest but weren’t disclosing the detailed reports they are required to make each year to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Women have made some gains under direct pressure from investors such as BlackRock Inc.and Vanguard Group Inc., but that has meant less focus on people of color. Black board membership has slipped and many minority workers have not been promoted into positions where they have a better shot at becoming a CEO one day. There is no current U.S. mandate to publicly disclose the race or gender of employees.About 30 companies of varying sizes, including Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc., already release copies of their private federal form on their Websites. JUST Capital, a non-profit that pushes companies for the same disclosure, says only 4% of companies release the EEOC data.Intel Corp. went a step further late last year and also revealed pay data by race, ethnicity and gender required by the EEOC. The data can be used to track progress that companies are making in reform because the collection methods are uniform.The companies named by Stringer also include BlackRock, Starbucks Corp., and Verizon Communications Inc. The companies have agreed to disclose their forms as part of their submission of data for 2019 and 2020 to the EEOC in 2021. The 2019 filings were delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.(Updates with additional companies releasing data in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Goldman and GM Among 34 Firms to Share Private Diversity Data

Coca-Cola in July first announced the plans to launch the alcoholic version of Topo Chico, its Mexican seltzer brand that’s gained a cult following.Molson Coors is looking to broaden its reach, following up on plans it announced last year when it dropped “Brewing Co.” from its name. The shift has come as consumers’ drinking habits move away from beer and toward products such as hard seltzer.“If you look at growth in hard seltzer, there are a few key drivers,” said Michelle St. Jacques, chief marketing officer at Molson Coors, in a phone interview. She cited growing interest in health and wellness, as well as demand for new drink flavors.Molson Coors will prioritize markets where Topo Chico has gained popularity.

2020-10-02,"Just like its rivals Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and Keurig Dr Pepper Inc (NASDAQ: KDP), the snack and beverage giant has taken a hit during the pandemic due to restaurant closures and other pandemic-related disruptions. But, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEP) had a joker in its deck of cards. Namely, its diversified food and beverage portfolio allowed the company to benefit from more people working and learning from home. It was clear this was Pepsi's notable asset even during the prior quarter as, unlike its rivals, Pepsi's Q2 total core gross margin rate grew 6 basis points to 55.6%. Its supremacy became even more obvious during its latest third quarter as sales snapped back from the pandemic.Q3 Earnings ReportPepsi topped analysts' estimates both for its earnings and revenue. Net sales of $18.09 billion expanded by 5.3% in its latest quarter as demand for Tostitos and pancake mixes grew. It exceeded the $17.23 billion expected by Refinitif.Despite the COVID-19 related costs of $147 million, Pepsi managed to deliver a net income of $2.29 billion, exceeding both estimates and the $2.1 billion it made in the same quarter last year.Performance Of Growth DriversDespite eased lockdown measures, both its Frito-Lay and Quaker Foods businesses reported organic revenue growth of 6%. So, even though people started feeling more at ease and leaving their homes, Frito-Lay saw an increased demand for Tostitos, Cheetos and Doritos. Moreover, Quaker Foods' pasta and macaroni and cheese dishes even reported double-digit sales growth.ForecastsPepsi provided an update to its fiscal 2020 outlook after pulling its forecasts in late April like the majority of companies. For the remainder of the fiscal year, Pepsi is now expecting organic revenue growth of 4% which is in line with its prior outlook. But as for earnings per share of $5.50, they are 38 cents less than its original forecast.New Markets On The HorizonSales of functional beverages amounted to approximately $31.7 billion last year which is 6.9% from 2018, according to Euromonitor International data. PepsiCo is launching a drink to get a piece of its subsegment, the $1 billion sleep aid industry. In September, Pepsi unveiled Driftwell that contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation and calmness. Pepsi plans to launch its counter-stress drink online later this year and in stores early next year.PepsiCo has been on the quest to fortify its position in the health and wellness sector for several years now. In 2016, it acquired kombucha beverage maker KeVita and the plant-based energy bar company Health Warrior two years later. It already expanded the range of its sports drink megabrand Gatorade with the launch of nighttime protein powders. It is also considering a move into alcoholic drinks. PepsiCo is looking at the bigger picture. It used to keep people hyped but now it will also have products to calm them down.Going Green PepsiCo committed to shift to 100% renewable energy by 2040. Coca-Cola has set 2030 as its deadline, but it only committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by ¼ with its base year being 2015. However, PepsiCo plans to source 100% renewable electricity across all company-owned and controlled operations globally also by 2030, but its franchises and third-party operators will join the green train by 2040. Outlook Pepsi succeeded to plant more optimism about the sustainability of its growth drivers. It delivered a strong profit as snacks and sodas thrived both during the lockdown and with eased social distancing measures. The bottom line is that the soda giant is doing good, it is going green and it is bravely stepping out into new markets. It is also forecasting a full-year profit that is above market expectations.

2020-10-07,"(Bloomberg) -- With millions of Americans still sheltering in place and cooking their own meals, the grocery industry has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise battered U.S. economy. Unless, that is, you are Whole Foods Market, the upscale chain acquired three years ago by Amazon.com Inc. Trips to Whole Foods in September were down 25% from a year earlier, according to Placer.ai, which tallies retail foot traffic from some 30 million mobile devices. Some of the decline is due to consumers consolidating shopping trips and buying more groceries online, but the traffic decline at Whole Foods is much steeper than at Walmart Inc., Kroger Co. and Trader Joe’s. Visits to Albertsons Cos., meanwhile, actually increased last month, compared with a year ago. And though Earnest Research estimates that Whole Foods sales (including online) rose by as much as 10% during the pandemic, some rivals are posting twice the gains. “Everyone is buying more everywhere, but total customers are actually down for Whole Foods,” Michael Maloof, who tracks consumer habits for Earnest Research, said in a telephone interview. “Whole Foods is in a uniquely horrible place.”Amazon doesn’t break out Whole Foods sales, so getting a complete picture of the chain’s travails is difficult. But few grocers were more awkwardly positioned for the pandemic, analysts say. The stores were rarely a one-stop destination before the outbreak even for fans. The company expanded its prepared meals sections for office workers seeking lunch or dinner on the go, but now those customers are homebound. And Whole Foods shoppers who have time to visit stores often confront long lines and aisles crowded with gig workers paid to fetch online orders.Meanwhile, despite expectations that the world’s largest e-commerce company would use Whole Foods to re-invent food shopping, Amazon has opted to open a separate chain called Amazon Fresh. Some analysts have even soured on the $13.7 billion acquisition. Bill Bishop, a longtime grocery industry consultant and founder of the consulting firm Brick meets Click, says the deal was probably well-thought out at the time but in retrospect was a “strategic error.”In an emailed statement, a Whole Foods spokeswoman said: “Whole Foods Market continues to grow, and we strongly dispute this portrayal of the health of our business. In addition to offering a safe in-store shopping experience, we're proud we've been able to rapidly expand grocery delivery and pickup to meet the needs of customers.” Presented with the data points used in this story,  she didn’t specify which, if any, were inaccurate reflections of the grocer’s business. The spokeswoman also declined to discuss the company’s sales performance. Chief Executive Officer John Mackey has said in recent interviews that sales of meats and other categories surged during the pandemic on buying from shoppers cooking at home.Co-founded in 1980 by Mackey in Austin, Texas, Whole Foods helped fuel the organic food movement. By stocking products shoppers couldn’t get anywhere else and setting high quality standards, the chain drew loyal fans and was able to command prices other retailers couldn't—earning it the epithet “Whole Paycheck.” The grocer shied away from a cookie-cutter approach to new stores, instilling a quirky, down-home vibe even as it grew to hundreds of locations through expansion and acquisitions. (One former employee likens Whole Foods to “a big old cuddly nonprofit that accidentally became a corporation.”)     But after rising interest in healthier food led mainstream grocers to stock organic items, Whole Foods struggled to keep its growth going. By the time Amazon stepped in, sales growth and profitability were in decline, and an activist investor was pushing for changes.  Cosmetically, change came quickly. Continuing a tradition as old as supermarkets, Amazon touted price cuts on staples to get new shoppers in the door. It promoted Amazon electronics inside Whole Foods and placed online delivery lockers in dozens of stores. Amazon Prime became the Whole Foods’ loyalty program.  At the same time, executives at both companies preached a hands-off approach to integration. Responsibility for the chain in Seattle fell to physical retail czar Steve Kessel, and, after he stepped down, to logistics chief Dave Clark. The executives, who also sent deputies to work with Mackey, kept in touch with monthly and quarterly video call meetings patterned after Amazon’s corporate practice that prioritizes data over gut feelings or emotional appeals.A clear priority from Seattle from the beginning was online ordering, a push that only accelerated when the pandemic sparked an unprecedented spike in web grocery orders. At busy locations during peak shopping hours, the crush of contract shoppers and regular customers can cause traffic jams.Whole Foods has tweaked store hours in some markets—and even temporarily shut down some locations—to make more room for online delivery, but crowding has become a frequent complaint of customers, one that has only grown louder as the pandemic limited store capacity.In at least one Whole Foods store in the San Francisco Bay Area, online sales now regularly exceed in-store purchases, according to a person familiar with the figures.Phoenix Normand, who picked the building where he lives in Los Angeles in part because it’s near a Whole Foods store, says he now finds himself trying to shop earlier in the day to avoid long lines at the entrance that he attributes to the presence of Prime shoppers grabbing online orders.“I don’t know if Amazon’s move is to push people to do more [online] shopping versus being in the store,” he says. “It would be nice if they would let us know that. Don’t get me wrong, I like to pick my own produce, but if I have to fight with eight people over a fricking avocado, maybe I should be hiring someone to do it for me.”Whole Foods last month opened a warehouse-like facility in Brooklyn designed to fulfill online orders. The company has considered other “dark” stores to reduce pressure on crowded locations, but focused instead on opening the New York one first, according to a person familiar with the discussions but not authorized to talk about them.  “The Prime shoppers certainly changed the experience at Whole Foods,” says a former senior Whole Foods manager, who requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. “They’re the exact opposite of a Whole Foods shopper. They’re about speed, efficiency. If you’re not selling that same experience, you shouldn’t expect those margins.”Even before Amazon bought Whole Foods, the chain began centralizing decision-making over everything  from what to stock to the signage over the bakery department. That eroded the sway of regional managers who had helped the chain build a reputation for launching small brands you couldn’t find elsewhere. Some shoppers complain that it’s harder to find distinctive products on the shelves these days, a contention Whole Foods disputes. “Whole Foods seems to be going downhill very quickly,” says Danielle Harnisch, a 65-year-old retiree who has done most of her shopping at the Petaluma, California, store for years. She’s turned off by stubbornly high prices, and a decline in selection that seems to have grown more acute during the pandemic. Now, she’s making more trips to Trader Joe’s and two locally owned markets.A Whole Foods spokesperson says the store's selection today includes 30% more locally sourced products than in 2016, the year before Amazon bought the chain.Numerator, a research firm, estimates that 4.5 million fewer U.S. households have shopped inside a Whole Foods since the beginning of March, compared with a year earlier. The research firm says the chain is losing former devotees like Harnisch, and replacing some of them with a younger, more urban cohort of shoppers, many of whom are already plugged into Prime, Amazon’s membership program, but are typically less wealthy. Numerator’s data, gleaned from customer receipts and surveys, suggest Amazon’s online push has gained traction, with  roughly a third of U.S. households buying groceries digitally at some point since the beginning of March, up 10 percentage points from a year ago. Its unclear how many of them can be persuaded to stick around after the pandemic ends, or be converted to in-store Whole Foods shoppers, who tend to make bigger purchases. The former Whole Foods senior manager sees the writing on the wall, and it’s the new Amazon Fresh chain. The first store opened last month in Los Angeles and many more are expected to follow. The new chain, which tapped Whole Foods expertise, emphasizes in-store pickup from a dedicated counter and stocks national consumer brands like Coca-Cola that have long been verboten at Whole Foods.

Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equates to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Coca-Cola EPS will likely be near $0.46 while revenue will be around $8.35 billion, according to analysts. Coca-Cola reported a per-share profit of $0.56 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $9.51 billion.What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter?

2020-10-22,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. sales are inching back toward normal, even as it warns a resurgent virus could continue to muddle near-term results.Global unit case volume was down 4% in the third quarter as the restaurants and entertainment venues that make up about half of revenues aren’t yet back to normal. Still, that’s far better than the second quarter when volume fell 16%. Some increase in at-home consumption has helped offset the problems in public spaces.“Our brand portfolio is working hard to return to pre-Covid levels of growth and we have made progress,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said on an earnings call.“However, it’s important to remember the world is in a fragile state, and we’ve seen reopening trends begin to moderate,” he added. “We don’t expect to return to the peak levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and closures.”Shares rose as much as 2.4% at 9:30 a.m. in New York. They were down 9.7% through Wednesday’s close.Coke executives said in July that the soda giant had made it through the worst of the downturn. Still, Quincey warned this summer that the global economy could take two to three years to recover. The sequential improvement is slow: The percentage decline in global unit case volume for October month-to-date remained in the low single digits.There were some bright spots in the quarter. Trademark Coca-Cola grew 1%, it said, while Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew 7% in the quarter, it said. At the same time, tea and coffee declined 15%, primarily driven by virus-related challenges at Costa retail stores, it said in a statement.The company will continue to cut down the number of products it sells, with a goal of offering about 200 master brands, a 50% reduction from the current level. Earlier this month, it said it would be dropping some lower-performing items like Tab diet soda and Zico coconut water in the U.S. Dropping the product lines will only result in an about 1% hit to profits, he said on the earnings call.“We’re trying to end up with a blueprint that we think is right for the future,” Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said in an interview. “We’re going to have to make some tough decisions.”The company -- which announced in late August that it would offer buyout packages to almost 40% of its North American workforce, followed by an unspecified number of involuntary layoffs -- said those actions were “underway,” without providing a total number of impacted workers. Murphy said Coca-Cola expects to be able to provide more information in the first quarter.Competitor PepsiCo Inc. offered a full-year outlook when it reported results Oct. 1. Coke, however, said it couldn’t give a forecast given the virus uncertainty.Still, executives said they’re confident the soda maker will return to the high end of its long-term growth model, without providing a timeline.“I think there is some caution because when you actually drill in and look at the world, there’s a lot of different dynamics at play and therefore very difficult to predict what the near term looks like,” Murphy said. “We still think the actions that we are cementing and putting in place set us up very well for when things actually turn and are back to a more normal environment.”(Adds details from company earnings call)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Coke Inches Back as CEO Notes World Still in ‘Fragile State’

The $27 level continues to hold as support, but what investors really need to see is the stock break out over the 10-week moving average. As long as it remains below this mark, it will have trouble rallying. 
Above the 10-week could put $30 and the 200-week moving average in play. Below the 10-week moving average and $27 remains on the table. 
Below $27 and this week’s low at $26.54 is vulnerable. If that level fails to hold as support, $25 could be back in the realm of possibilities. 

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Coca-Cola (KO)
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Like Tesla, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was only slightly higher on Thursday despite reporting earnings.
Also like Tesla, Coca-Cola is trying to breakout over resistance as it rides the 50-day moving average higher. Who would have thought that KO and TSLA stocks had so much in common, at least, technically speaking. 
A close over $51.50 — and preferably $52 for good measure — would be enough to kickstart the move higher. It could put $55 in play and potentially higher if bulls really regain momentum. 
If KO stock can’t break out, the 50-day moving average is support. A close below this mark puts the $48 area on watch. A close below $48 and its major moving averages does not bode well for longs. 
I want little to do with Coca-Cola stock if it breaks this many support marks. 

Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Lam Research (LRCX)
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) reported pretty solid earnings results, although I don’t think bulls are going to panic about a 1.5% drop after such a stellar run. 
In fact, this is a very nice-looking little bull flag (blue lines) down to the 20-day moving average. The decline also filled the gap left from earlier this month. By most accounts, this is pretty healthy price action. 
What I want to see now is a move back over the 10-day moving average (not shown on the chart above, but currently at $362). If we get it, odds are favorable for a long setup. 
It would put $380 in play on the upside, followed by a possible breakout toward $400. On the downside, a close below the 20-day moving average and Thursday’s low would be the risk point.

2020-10-25,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola European Partners Plc, the world’s largest independent bottler of the storied soft drink, is in talks to acquire Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. to expand in Asia Pacific, according to people familiar with the matter.Negotiations between the European and Australian bottlers are advanced and could be announced within days, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. Details, including on the structure of the deal, are still being finalized and talks could yet fall apart, the people said.Coca-Cola Amatil, based in North Sydney, has a market value of about A$7.8 billion ($5.6 billion) and enterprise value of almost A$10 billion including debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares were halted on Oct. 23 pending an announcement on a “potential material transaction.” U.K.-based Coca-Cola European Partners has a market value of about $17.7 billion.A deal between the two bottlers would be the largest involving an Australian company so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A representative for Coca-Cola European Partners couldn’t be immediately reached, while Coca-Cola Amatil declined to comment.The talks underscore how soft drink bottlers are under pressure to consolidate as the popularity of sugary drinks declines, as well as because of the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Coca-Cola European Partners decided early this year to halt its buyback program and defer a dividend to preserve cash.Coca-Cola European Partners is interested in a majority acquisition of Coca-Cola Amatil, though some of the people said it’s also previously discussed asset purchases. Both sides are working with advisers, the people said.Coca-Cola European Partners is the world’s largest Coca-Cola bottler by revenue, with 48 production sites in Germany, Spain, Great Britain and elsewhere, according to a fact sheet on its website.Coca-Cola Amatil is a dominant player in the Asia Pacific region, with 32 production facilities in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, according to its website.The company has been named as a potential bidder for Australian liquor assets being sold by Japan’s Asahi Group Holdings Ltd., which could require a capital raise, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.Coca-Cola European Partners was created from the three-way merger of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Germany’s Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke AG agreed in 2015. The biggest shareholder is Cobega, an investment vehicle belonging to Spain’s Daurella family, followed by the American soda maker Coca-Cola Co., Bloomberg data show.(Adds enterprise value of about A$10 billion in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Coca-Cola Europe Bottler in Talks for Record Australian Deal

According to Bloomberg data, the largest shareholder is Cobega, an investment vehicle belonging to Spain’s Daurella family, followed by the US-based soda maker Coca-Cola Co. (KO).The report of a potential deal for consolidation comes as soft drink bottlers are grappling with a decline in global demand for sugary drinks due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has increased the appetite for more healthy drinks and nutrition in general.Earlier this year, Coca-Cola European Partners withdrew its buyback program and deferred a dividend to preserve cash.

2020-10-29,"Shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $47.78.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-06  * Strike Price: $47.00  * Volume: 897  * Open Interest: 1202Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * A Look Into Coca-Cola's Price Over Earnings  * Recap: Coca-Cola Q3 Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: PEP) at Equal-Weight, $157 price target.Coca-Cola's 'ReKOvery' Underway: The bullish case for Coca-Cola is based on expectations for the beverage giant to outperform versus expectations across several metrics, Wells Fargo's Carey said in a note. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary shift in how people consume Coca-Cola but demand never fell so a recovery to the point where ""COVID had never happened"" will be seen by early 2023.Wall Street's current estimates are at least $1 billion short of Wells Fargo's estimates despite a return back to some form of a new normal.The beverage company is likely to identify dozens of single-country brands that offer little or no scale and growth opportunities. The research firm identified 78 ""Zombie"" companies that account for just 2.3% of global sales but showed declining sales in 2019. These brands will likely be on the ""chopping block.""Bottom line, Carey said the pandemic ushered in a mere channel shift but won't have a permanent change to consumption habits and trends.Keurig Has Growth Concerns: Keurig Dr Pepper deserves credit for performing well throughout the pandemic and even outperforming rivals in certain categories, Carey said. The Street is modeling strong growth beyond fiscal 2021 but Wells Fargo doesn't share a similar projection.Specifically, Carey said the company has shown a weighted average category growth of around 3% and has succeeded in growing margins by 600 basis points from fiscal 2018 through 2021. But expectations for mid-teens organic EPS growth after fiscal 2021 ""could be difficult"" as the company already benefited from synergies.Related Link: Morgan Stanley Has A Caffeine Buzz For Keurig Dr PepperMolson's Two Key Questions: Beer company Molson Coors has seen its stock rise more than 40% since September as expectations had ""fallen too low"" and investors are correlated encouraging vaccine news with improving sales as the economy re-opens, Carey said.But investors need to ask themselves two questions: 1) are there EPS catalysts to support higher expectations, and 2) has the company's growth algorithm changed that would justify the multiple expansion?""Our work suggests 'no' to both for now,"" the analyst wrote in the note. ""Sales/EPS expectations seem reasonable and TAP valued appropriately,"" the analyst wrote. ""We see time to assess a recovery in TAP or capitalize on dislocations.""Monster Beverage Is One Of Two Major Players: The global energy beverage segment consists of just two players and Monster Beverage is a ""scarcity play"" on the large and fast-growing category, Carey said. Despite already impressive growth, the energy beverage is still in development based on per capita consumption.The global opportunity remains ""nascent"" and Monster Beverage can leverage its relationship with Coca-Cola to sustain growth moving forward.Waiting For PepsiCo's Confirmation Of Growth: PepsiCo can mostly be counted on to show organic sales growth as has been the case each year since 2013, Carey said. In fact, the company showed a global weighted average category growth of 5.1% in 2019 and this is the second-best among Wells Fargo's coverage.However, a 5.1% growth is merely at the mid-point of its 4% to 6% sales algorithm but there isn't any real reason to suggest the growth rate can improve to the high-end of the range. To be clear, there are potential paths for this to be possible, such as through an M&A spree, but investors need signs of confirmation of growth before turning bullish.Latest Ratings for KO  DateFirmActionFromTo  Dec 2020Wells FargoInitiates Coverage OnOverweight  Oct 2020UBSMaintainsBuy  Oct 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweight    View More Analyst Ratings for KO   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Is Apple Giving Peleton A Run For Its Money With Fitness+ Launch?  * Stitch Fix's Big Earnings Beat And 40% Stock Pop Not Enough To Convince Some Analysts(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-12-09,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has added a competitor to its year-old coalition of companies pledging to reduce their contribution to climate change: Microsoft Corp.The two technology giants, neighbors in the Seattle area and rivals in cloud computing and business software, have each spent much of the last two years announcing increasingly aggressive climate targets, including dueling umbrella organizations for companies willing to do their part to avert the catastrophic warming of the planet. On Wednesday, Microsoft said it had signed onto Amazon’s pact, alongside consumer products giant Unilever Plc and several other new signatories.Amazon, long a laggard among its peers in publicly addressing its impact on the environment, reversed course in recent years, bolstering an internal sustainability team and vowing to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. The company also invited others interested in matching that commitment to sign on to what it calls the Climate Pledge, a forum for comparing notes on best practices and climate-friendly investment opportunities.Microsoft, meanwhile, has said it hopes to use new technologies to remove from the atmosphere all of the greenhouse gases the company was responsible for generating during its entire existence.Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s Chief Environmental Officer, said the software maker’s previous pledges already more than meet the Climate Pledge standard, but it’s important to send a signal with participation in Amazon’s effort, particularly because less than 5% of Fortune 500 companies have promised to get to net-zero emissions.“There’s been this false perception that there is this kind of climate race,” he said. “There is a climate race, but it’s not between tech companies, it’s between every company and society and time.”The other new Climate Pledgers make for an eclectic mix. Coca-Cola European Partners, the largest Coca-Cola bottler by revenue, joined. So did Harbour Air Ltd., a tour and charter float plane company based near Vancouver, Canada. (Business boosters have long pushed for more frequent routes between Vancouver and Seattle.)And Neste Oyj, a Finnish state-backed oil refiner making a push into renewable energy, became the first signatory that does the bulk of its business in the fossil fuels industry.(Updates with renewable fuels push in the eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft, Unilever Join Amazon Vow to Fight Climate Change"

2020-12-14,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A coalition of states is suing to try to break up Facebook Inc. — the latest event to call the company's future into question. If Microsoft Corp.'s antitrust ordeal is at all analogous — over three years from suit to settlement — it could be a long time before the outcome of all this is known. And it could be years more until we see the ultimate impact on Facebook.For investors in the social media company's stock, the future might look different from the kind of innovation and industry dominance we've seen over the past decade. But it could still turn out well for shareholders if the company's focus shifts more toward optimizing its operations for near-term profitability with an emphasis on financial engineering.Despite its enviable growth rate and online advertising duopoly with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook's stock has a relatively pedestrian valuation. While there's considerable uncertainty about how economic growth will play out next year, Facebook shares are valued at around 24.5 times adjusted earnings estimated for 2021, compared with the S&P 500 as a whole trading at 21 or 22 times 2021 earnings estimates. Facebook's multiple is lower than companies like Walmart Inc. or Coca-Cola Co., perhaps suggesting that a fair amount of regulatory risk is already built into the stock.Of the various possible outcomes of Facebook's antitrust challenges, one might be that it remains a company whose core advertising business is secure, while its ability to encroach on emerging fields is limited. That's arguably what happened with Microsoft, which famously missed out on the internet, social media and smartphones in the 2000s while its core cash cows of Windows and Office remained intact. Despite being sidelined during all that innovation, Microsoft's revenues grew from $15.3 billion in 1998 to $60.4 billion in 2008. In the same way, a less innovative Facebook is still likely to reap years of revenue growth from riding the secular trend in digital advertising growth.So while a breakup of the company — however likely that might be — would be humiliating for Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and strip him of power, it could be a value-creating event for shareholders similar to the split of EBay Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. Facebook shareholders would get shares in the separated entities: the main social network referred to as Facebook Blue, as well as Instagram and/or Whatsapp. Blue could be to Facebook what eBay’s marketplace business was to eBay, a slow-growth business that generates a lot of profit. Blue is also the business line that gets the company in the most trouble with respect to political and controversial content. If it were split off from the rest of the company, it could institute a dividend and focus on cash generation and stock buybacks. With interest rates as low as they are, the company could even borrow tens of billions of dollars at cheap interest rates to opportunistically buy back more shares, similar to what Apple has done in recent years.Meanwhile, growth-centric investors could get access to faster-growing, undermonetized Instagram and Whatsapp without the messiness of Facebook Blue. Both companies seem on the verge of doing a better job of generating revenue from their platforms, with Whatsapp showing particular promise in countries like India. And as the businesses mature, they, too, could get into the dividend and buyback game.Facebook doesn't need any more world-changing innovations for its stock to work for investors. While emerging platforms like TikTok and Snapchat are growing ad revenue, and Amazon has developed a multibillion-dollar ad platform, there's no evidence that Facebook is in any danger of seeing its network fade away anytime soon.If innovation-focused investors get skittish about antitrust risks and dump Facebook's stock, value investors should be there to pick it up, with the investment case tied more to returning capital to shareholders than taking over the world. That's the kind of win both Wall Street and Washington could get behind.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

2020-12-23,"The major stock indexes had a rocky start to the week because news came out that there was a new strain of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The news of more lockdowns and travel restrictions sent oil and equities lower at the open Monday morning.
There could be more bad news on the way regarding these new coronavirus variants. As CNBC wrote yesterday:
The new coronavirus strain that was first detected in the United Kingdom could already be circulating in the United States without notice, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While the variant hasn’t yet been found in the U.S. yet, the CDC noted that scientists haven’t sequenced the genetic coding for many Covid-19 infections here. So it could have slipped notice.
On Monday, despite unemployment, slow growth, travel restrictions and an ongoing global recession, investors bought the dip. As we have said before, while this is a risky market, it’s not completely irrational to assume the economy will turn the corner in 2021 and stocks should be higher, but we still want to be careful.
The reaction to yesterday’s news that a new strain of coronavirus could be in the U.S. is a good reminder that caution is necessary. The fear about new problems from COVID-19 erased a lot of Monday’s bullish buying.
For traders invested in stay-at-home stocks, Monday offered a chance to take gains off the table. Last week we talked about all the reasons we still liked Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI). As we said then:
Despite the good news, rising infection and death rates in the U.S. will likely lead to another round of semi-lockdowns or travel restrictions after Christmas.
As frustrating as that is for all of us, it should also give investors another chance to capitalize on their favorite “stay-at-home” picks from this past year. In our case, we think we should bet on increased demand for video conferencing and PC audio equipment, which is where Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) earns much of its margins these days.
We recommended selling puts against the stock, and thanks to its jump higher on Monday, we were able to close those put writes early and lock in a profit.
We still like Logitech, and we think its position in the high-end webcam and peripherals market is defensible, but we’re going to wait for another dip before we enter a new position on the stock.
So now where can we turn our bullish selling? We’d argue that The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a great target for a bullish put write.
A Different Kind of Consumer Stock
The stimulus package has passed both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate and exceeded our expectations in terms of total spending — $900 billion versus $750 billion expected.
The bill includes enough support for consumers through direct payments and unemployment benefits to support spending in the short term.
With the stay-at-home stocks riding high again, consumer staples are a segment of consumer stocks worth considering as replacement positions.
As we are often fond of saying, during good times, people celebrate with a Coke. During bad times, they comfort themselves with a Coke.
The Coca-Cola Company hasn’t had an easy time this year. As Zacks notes:
The coronavirus pandemic has hit all segments hard and the beverage industry is no exception. The Coca-Cola Company KO is among the beverage companies that have been focusing on restructuring to make good the losses suffered due to the closure of the away-from-home channel. Notably, on-premise avenues, including restaurants, bars, movie theaters and stadiums, which are key contributors to sales, have remained closed since the onset of the pandemic in March, which is hurting revenues.
The soft-drinks giant’s revenues for third-quarter 2020 declined 9% year over year, driven by a decrease in away-from-home channels like restaurants, sporting events and movie theaters.
The company is now planning on restructuring, cutting more than 2,000 jobs worldwide.
But still, some analysts like the stock because it pays a strong dividend. In the short term, we think they’re correct. KO may see some additional buying in the last two weeks of the year, making it an excellent target for a bullish put write position.
Looking for a Stable Start to the New Year
Coca-Cola stock dipped to support Monday morning as the market declined, but its support held. We think investors will be looking to reallocate to the big dividend payers during the slow Christmas week.
With the new stimulus package on the way, exposure to consumer stocks is important, so Coca-Cola Company stock can help traders earn extra income while they wait for stocks like Logitech to pullback.

Daily Chart of Coca-Cola Company – Chart Source: TradingView
KO is forming a bullish inverse “head-and-shoulders” pattern which will be confirmed if the stock closes above the neckline near $54 per share.
Selling puts with a lower strike price gives traders a chance to take advantage of the upside potential but remain safe if the stock continues to channel in its current range and does not break out before the new year.
KO’s support at $52 would, therefore, make an excellent strike price for a put write. When looking for expirations, pick one that offers a decent premium without obligating you for too long. We recommend staying in the mid-January range.

(NASDAQ: PEP) has come to an end at RBC, mostly due to valuation concerns.The Analyst: Nik Modi downgraded Coca-Cola's stock from Outperform to Sector Perform with an unchanged $55 price target. The analyst also downgraded PepsiCo's stock from Outperform to Sector Perform with an unchanged $153 price target.The Coca-Cola Thesis: Modi said Coca-Cola's management team deserves credit for recent initiatives, including organizational redesign, optimizing the portfolio, among other initiatives, but it will ""take time for the company to hit its stride"" given many moving pieces.For example, the organizational changes only came into effect on Jan. 1 and there will be ""growing pains"" for at least one to two quarters. Investors may not see signs of improvement until the third quarter while the full impact won't be realized until 2022.Coca-Cola faces similar headwinds as every other company as social distancing and other health measures will likely remain in place until at least the middle of the summer, the analyst wrote in the note. Meanwhile, employers will continue to hold an ""overly-cautious"" view in asking workers to return to the office.It's possible this thesis is wrong and society will enter ""a roaring 20's type scenario"" sooner than expected. In the meantime, Modi said Coca-Cola's stock is trading at around 26 times next year's EPS, marking the highest valuation level seen in five years and a 16% premium versus its large-cap peers.The PepsiCo Thesis: Modi said PepsiCo's strong exposure to snacks and management's focus on new product launches like Pepsi Zero Sugar and new Mountain Dew flavors implies recent momentum can be sustained. Other encouraging initiatives in the pipeline include investing in Gatorade Zero and positioning Bolt 24 to compete against Body Armor which is partially owned by Coca-Cola.However, PepsiCo's energy beverage line faces some near-term challenges after legal spats with Bang's parent company VPX. While a court concluded that VPX can't end its exclusive distribution partnership with PepsiCo until October 2023, the friction could pave the way for rivals to gain market share.PepsiCo's stock is trading at 24 times next year's EPS, marking a 16% premium to its five-year historical average and within striking distance of its all-time high.Price Action: Shares of Coca-Cola were trading lower by more than 3% Monday morning at $53.02, while shares of PepsiCo were lower by 2.3% at $144.92.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Google Employees Form Union  * Gene Munster Explains His Bullish Jumia Thesis(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-05,"Two months after election day...it's election day.Pre-voting jitters helped rough up Wall Street Monday ahead of Georgia Senate elections today that will determine control of Congress. Then the market wobbled overnight, trading both sides of unchanged. By morning, things looked neutral. Today could be one of those days where direction is hard to find as investors bide their time waiting for results from the Peach State.This isn't a political column, but there's growing concern among investors that a Democratic victory might lead to corporate or capital gains taxes rising. Some analysts even think earnings estimates could take a hit if Democrats win, based on ideas that a higher corporate tax could crimp profits.The market took a beating yesterday on this type of talk, combined with news out of the UK on lockdowns.  Although the lockdowns are very real, the tax talk is all extremely speculative.Whoever wins, it'll likely remain tough to get much done on Capitol Hill considering how closely matched the two parties are in the House and Senate. Having said that, many investors counted on Washington gridlock when they bid up the market over the last two months. Recent polls from Georgia suggested maybe that isn't so certain, raising the prospect of full Democratic control of the House, Senate, and White House for the first time since 2009-2010.All these swirling political winds mean we could be in for a choppy ride the next day or two--or even longer, depending on how long it takes to count the votes. Polls have been extremely close, for what it's worth, and the tighter the race, the more scrutiny the results could come under. Once this is over, it's going to be nice to finally have elections behind us.Stay At Home Vs. Reopening: 2021 Version Monday didn't get the year off to a very promising start. At times, major indices fell 2% or more after earlier making new all-time highs. It was kind of like experiencing March 2020 and December 2020 on the same day.It was also the first time since 2016 where major indices fell on the first trading day of the year. It's not worth reading too much into that. Stocks rose on the first day of 2018, a year when major indices ended up lower. They also rose the first days of 2017, 2019, and 2020--years when major indices ended higher.With today's election putting so much focus on Georgia, maybe it's not ironic that Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), based in Atlanta, was one of the worst performers yesterday. What may have hurt KO was rising virus-related hospitalizations and cases that had some investors worried it could take longer to get back to normal.A new lockdown in England to keep the new strain of COVID-19 under control probably helped push KO and other stocks down on Monday, too. KO shares were up in December thanks in part to ideas that people would soon be heading back to ballgames and other venues where the company sees so much of its business. A downgrade from a Wall Street analyst also appeared to hurt KO shares.Reopening delay worries seemed to weigh on hotels and airlines to start the week, with Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) also getting knocked. It may be a new year, but that same narrative we saw through much of 2020--stay at home vs. going out--hasn't gone away. The vaccines are a great tool and there's a lot of hope they can change this narrative going forward, but they're not a magic bullet. The logistical challenges so far reinforce that.Volatility Flares To Start Year Despite the year starting on a down note for Wall Street, yesterday's selloff wasn't necessarily the worst thing that could have happened.Let's face it, nothing goes straight up forever. The market looked like it was due for a selloff based on what's happened the last few weeks, especially with major indices so far above their long-term moving averages. It may feel bad when a selloff happens, but you could argue stocks got out a little over their skis recently. The major indices did have nice comebacks late yesterday, but sometimes that can set things up for a retest of the lows.As noted here yesterday, volatility is on the rise. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) hit two-week highs Monday, rose again early Tuesday, and is probably going to remain elevated as long as the political situation stays so tense. VIX approached 30 at times Monday, a level it flirted with last fall but ultimately had trouble staying above. That could remain the area to watch.Speaking of what to watch, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) finished right at 3700 on Monday after falling below a technical support level at 3750 early in the day. It had gone well under 3700 at times, so the comeback to close there might have some positive technical ramifications going into Tuesday. The Monday SPX low of around 3662 didn't come close to approaching key near-term support that sits near 3633, according to research firm CFRA. We'll see if the SPX tests that low today and if it holds.Meanwhile, the sagging dollar index sits just below 90 and just above an area where CFRA sees support at 89.33. A drop below that might raise some eyebrows around the market, with the dollar already at nearly three-year lows. Dovish Fed policy is helping push the dollar lower, and that tends to raise commodity prices.Crude, however, came under pressure early this week as investors awaited an OPEC production decision. It had been expected Monday but got postponed to Tuesday, media reported. OPEC has to decide whether to increase output in February.On the data front, stay tuned for ISM manufacturing data this morning. Sometimes this report can be influential because it provides insight into the state of manufacturing on a national level and can sometimes provide perspective on future demand from business and consumers.CHART OF THE DAY: BOUNCING OFF THE VOLATILITY FLOOR. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)--which finished 2020 in the low 20s--nearly touched 30 at one point yesterday before settling in just below 27. A year ago, a VIX above 20 was seen by many as a sign of elevated risk. But since the COVID outbreak, the risk gauge has bounced off that 20 level several times, only to pop back up. Data source: Cboe Global Markets. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.A Word from Investors: December's Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM)--TD Ameritrade's proprietary, behavior-based index to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the market--increased to 6.26 in December, up 15.71 percent from its November score of 5.41.To cap off a tumultuous year, the positive headlines in December apparently helped lead some TD Ameritrade clients to increase their exposure to the markets. There's no question that the final trading period of the year reflected a growing sense of optimism around economic recovery and hope for an end to the pandemic. In 2021, however, the pandemic will most likely continue as the No. 1 news story for at least the first half of the year and with that, it will most likely remain the greatest source of market volatility. In the December period, TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers overall and net buyers of equities. Some of the popular names bought during the period were Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA), Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), and salesforce,com, inc. (NYSE: CRM) Although clients were net buyers of equities, they found some names to sell during the period, including: Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK), Fastly Inc (NYSE: FSLY) Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY), Haliburton Company (NYSE: HAL), and Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR). Walking Down ""Main Street"": While COVID-19 will likely be with us for a while and the next few months could be tough, it is encouraging to see some major investment banks predicting better times ahead. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is one of the more optimistic voices on Wall Street, predicting U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.9% in 2021, up from a drop of 3.5% in 2020. The bank expects global growth to be even better at above 6%. ""Though challenges remain, we think this global recovery is sustainable, synchronous and supported by policy, following much of the 'normal' post-recession playbook,"" the company said in a research note last month.This isn't just good news for the markets (if it happens). It also could mean better times for Main Street, which hasn't shared the big gains enjoyed by many major companies over the last six months. As long as Main Street keeps struggling and millions of Americans are out of their jobs due to the pandemic, things won't be truly back to normal. Crowded Jetways: Though the skies looked gloomy for airline stocks Monday, it's worth noting that more people boarded airliners on Sunday than on any day since the pandemic began. A total of 1.327 million people passed through Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) checkpoints on Sunday, compared with 2.42 million on the same weekend day a year earlier, TSA said. That's the most for a single day since March 15. Of course, this raised some concerns that there could be a post-holiday surge in new cases due to all the travel. We have to wait and see, but that's another thing potentially gumming up the works of this long rally.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

2021-01-06,"On Wednesday, shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $50.77.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-06-18  * Strike Price: $55.00  * Volume: 1053  * Open Interest: 4840Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For January 6, 2021  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For January 4, 2021(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

But what are the stocks that have been the basis of the massive market outperformance? And what has made Buffett work so well over the long history of the company that he leads?
Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time. And he has the report card to prove it, as just noted above. There are plenty of stories of his early years as an entrepreneur peddling door to door and like me working at a local grocery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
He would go on to the financial markets as a broker, working his way up at a series of firms. The basis for his public investment fortune and renown began with a series of investment partnerships, with locals investing in him and his investment process.
There are many bases in his investment approach. Amongst the leaders are his drive to invest in or buy companies with intrinsic value that was above the market’s price. This is when the underlying net assets that can be broadly defined as book value are higher than the stock value.
There have been an are plenty of companies that fit the criteria. Stock screens can easily pick out stocks that are currently trading at discounts to book value. But there is more to his method. there’s also cash generation. Generating cash is vital for companies, but consistently generating lots of cash in an efficient and predicable manner is a core necessity for a successful company and stock.
Blending these two concepts together leaves us looking for reliably profitable companies trading at a discount to intrinsic value. Those make for ideal investments.

And this is arguably why Berkshire Hathaway has had the long-haul market outperformance.

Then & Now
The performance of Berkshire is legendary, but has much of its success in earlier years. The past 10 years have not been as successful. It has returned over 187% — but the S&P 500 Index has done better with its return of over 260%.
And the same is the case for the past five years. And it gets worse over the past year.

Berkshire barely is positive over the past year returning only 2% against the S&P 500’s 17%. That is not good news for his shareholders. And yet, the share value of Berkshire is running at a big premium to its investments with a price to intrinsic (book) value at 1.31 times making his own stock not a Buffett buy.
And as for the cash as measured by free cash flow (excludes items like non-cash expenses) Berkshire is priced at 20.70 times its free cash flow compared to the S&P 500 Index member average of 16.20 times. This again argues that Berkshire isn’t a value Buffett value stock.
Perhaps a look under the hood of Berkshire via its last quarterly report shows what’s what for the numbers and the stock value and performance. Some of them are market stars, while others are severely challenged.
But does Buffett see something that the market isn’t yet getting? Let’s take a look at the top 10 stocks by shares held by Berkshire Hathaway. And note, Buffett doesn’t invest for what’s now – but what he sees working over time.

Warren Buffett Stocks: Bank of America (BAC)

First up on this list of Warren Buffet stocks is Bank of America. BAC is one of the leading U.S. commercial banks. It is valued now at 1.59 times book and at only 7.04 times free cash flow. And it has a dividend yield for cash for Berkshire at a yield of 2.2%.
The bank has a pretty good net interest margin (NIM, cost of funds against interest earned) of 2.2%. But it has ample costs for high efficiency ratio (the percentage cost of each dollar in revenue) of 59.8%. This means that it costs Bank of America nearly 60 cents for each dollar of revenue.

But with normalizing interest rates in the U.S. eventually expected along with economic recovery, the bank has promise for Berkshire.

Apple (AAPL)

Apple sells its smart phones and other devices as well as trying to peddle more services including content and fees from apps. It is expensive at 34.05 times book and 31.39 times free cash flow. But it has returned 76.3% over the trailing year.
Apple has piles of cash, as it pays little in dividends with a yield of 0.63%. But with its operating margin at 24.15%, it is efficient in its operations. The key of course is growing its universe of products in the field and, in turn, selling more fee income to those device customers.

Coca-Cola (KO)
Source: Coca-Cola (KO) – Source: Bloomberg

	
Coca-Cola (KO) is in the business of fizzy (and other) drinks. It is another expensive stock at 11.04 times book and 29.73 times free cash flow. But it does have a dependable stream of drink-buyers around the U.S., and globally that has resulted in sales gains of 8.6% over the past year.

KO stock has lost 7.83% in return over the past year. And that includes the dividend yielding 3.3%. It has less cash on hand and more debt — limiting its capabilities. But its operating margin is fat at 29.3% for an impressive return on shareholder’s equity of 40.78%. It needs to have customers guzzling more, and more customers coming around, for the market to take more notice.

Kraft Heinz (KHC)

Next on this list of Warren Buffet stocks is Kraft Heinz. KHC is in the consumer foods business, which has gone through various acquisitions and changes. It is in the middle of resolving accounting issues and questions, putting a pall on its stock value. But perhaps that makes for a bargain? It is valued at only 0.84 times book and 9.53 times free cash flow. This puts it into a Buffett stock category.
The stock has done better with the year’s return of 8.96%, and as perhaps more folks see the underlying discount of the stock value, it may prove out for Buffett.

American Express (AXP)
Source: American Express (AXP) – Source: Bloomberg

	
American Express is a financial services company focused on its charge and credit card businesses. It is valued at 4.45 times book and 25.65 times free cash flow, making for a bit of a pricey stock.

AXP has an excellent NIM at 8.8% — but its efficiency ratio is quite dear at 72.8%, meaning that it costs a lot to make each dollar of revenue.

U.S. Bank is my old bank that has embedded in it some of my old operations and customers. It is one of the better run banks in the U.S. with a conservative focus on customers and risk that has always proven out for its shareholders.
It is slightly pricey at 4.45 times book. And its price-to-free-cash-flow is 25.65 times. However, it has a better NIM for a bank at 3%. And its efficiency ratio is also better — but should be much better at 55.4%.
The stock has lost 4.56% in the past year. But with good asset and liability management and an improving U.S. economy, the bank is well placed for better return prospects.

Wells Fargo (WFC)

Wells Fargo, my next pick on this list of Warren Buffet stocks, is a bank with lingering troubles stemming from customer fraud. But that makes for a cheaper stock. The price-to-book is only at 1.09 times and the price-to-free-cash-flow is at a low 3.68 times. This may be a Buffett value stock right now.
The bank has a NIM of 2.5% that is in line with other major banks. And its efficiency ratio is high at 67.9%, meaning that it has lots to do for cost control.

General Motors makes cars and trucks — mostly trucks. And it has had some selling troubles with revenue down over the past year by 6.7%. It also has tight operating margins at only 4.45%. This is perhaps why the stock is valued at only 1.61 times book and 9.95 times free cash flow.
The company has been making strides to move toward a future including electric vehicles — many of the new and pending models have found good reviews and preorders. With its massive capabilities for production with the right products — this Buffett value stock has potential.

Bank of New York Mellon is an interesting behind-the-scenes company that makes so much of the markets work. It has lucrative cash-generating asset-management businesses of its own — but also provides clearing and custody for many leading financial and asset-management companies. The combination of its own asset management and its behind-the-scenes services makes for a very interesting company.
It is only valued at 0.98 times book, and with 16.2 times free cash flow, it is more like a Buffett value stock in the market right now. The key is that cash keeps coming in day after day from its services and asset-management businesses. This makes for a great fit for Berkshire.
The stock though has lost 9.56% including the dividend yielding 2.74%. And its NIM is low at 1.2%, making for tighter asset and liability management controls. Its efficiency ratio is at 66.2%, which should be better controlled by management.

But the business model is very good and attractive for a market that is increasingly valuing asset managers more highly as evidenced by mergers and acquisitions including by Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) of Eaton Vance (NYSE:EV).

The final pick on this list of Warren Buffet stocks is SIRI. Sirius XM is in the satellite audio business. I depend on its services (as do most in my family) in my vehicle. It is a cash-generator with regular subscription fees that may be at discounts, but are acceptable discounts for company cash flows.
Revenue is up by 35.1% over the past year — even with challenging auto sales and tough economic times during the pandemic. And its operating margin is pretty good at 22.56%.
The stock is way overvalued on a price-to-book basis as the company has few intrinsic assets given GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) accounting. And its price-to-free-cash-flow is at a higher level of 16.64 times. So, this is a challenge for Buffett to make the case of it being a value stock.
The stock has lost 7.61% including its dividend yielding 0.9%. But what might make for a value is that is does have a dedicated customer base for its services. And yes, alternative streaming makes for competition — but the simplicity of the onboard systems in cars, trucks and other vehicles makes for dependable cash flow for the company and its investors.

2021-01-14,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. has ended its long association with the International Life Sciences Institute, a blow to the powerful food organization known for its pro-sugar research and policies.The beverage giant ended its membership at the “global, regional and country level” as of this month, Coke said in a statement in response to inquiries from Bloomberg News. The decision was made after a routine review, the company said without offering additional details.The departure is a major setback for ILSI at a time when health-conscious consumers are increasingly turning away from sugar-laden beverages. The group, which was created in 1978 by a former Coke executive, still lists companies such as PepsiCo Inc. and Kellogg Co. as members, but Coke had been a prominent supporter and financial backer.Those companies didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the group’s membership list is up to date. ILSI didn’t respond to requests for comment.ILSI has come under fire in recent years for its role in influencing government health and nutrition policy around the world, acting as what some scientists and health experts have called an advocacy-oriented front group for its corporate members. The group has promoted the industry-friendly idea that physical exercise, not a change in diet, is how to combat obesity, according to a 2015 New York Times report. It has exerted influence around the world, including in a multidecade effort in China that was detailed in the Journal of Health, Politics, Policy and Law, as well as in India and Brazil.Citing the growing criticism, candy maker Mars left the organization in 2018, and Nestle exited at the regional and country levels in January of last year.Earlier DecisionCoke made the decision last year to sever ties, Mark Preisinger, the company’s director of corporate governance, said in an October letter viewed by Bloomberg that was sent to the Park Foundation, a non-profit organization that has been critical of ILSI.Corporate Accountability, a watchdog group that also has called out ILSI, said the move suggests Coke now sees “more risk than reward” in sticking with the organization. “For decades, ILSI has been Coca-Cola’s accomplice interfering in and blocking policies that aimed to safeguard people’s health and wellbeing across the world,” Ashka Naik, research director at Corporate Accountability, said in a statement.Coke’s shares were little changed at 11:25 a.m. in New York. The stock fell 0.9% last year amid pandemic-driven closures of sporting arenas, amusement parks and other venues, and the company has cut jobs.(Updates fourth paragraph to remove reference to McDonald’s.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Coca-Cola Severs Longtime Ties With Pro-Sugar Group

The company's portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks includes Gatorade, bubbly, Pure Leaf and Tropicana.The Key Difference: The big difference between the two beverage giants is the huge portfolio of food brands owned by PepsiCo.Under its Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats divisions, Pepsi owns brands like Lay's, Doritos, Quaker Oats, Sabra, Cheetos, Fritos, Tostitos, Cap'N Crunch and Aunt Jemima.Pepsi got 54% of its revenue from food in fiscal 2019, making its beverage division the smaller segment. The Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods North America segments made up 25% and 4% of overall fiscal 2019 revenue, respectively.Frito-Lay North America made up 45% of the operating profit for PepsiCo in fiscal 2019.

Shares are up 48% over the last five years and up 112% over the last 10 years.What's Next: Coca-Cola has made several acquisitions over the years to grow its non-sparkling soft drink segment. This could be a continued focus by the company.Coca-Cola is also phasing out underperforming brands like Zico and Tab. A national launch of the company's Topo Chico hard seltzer is happening in the first half of 2021 with distribution partner Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE: TAP).Pepsi has been acquiring food brands to boost its more profitable business segment. Acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery will help strengthen the company in Africa and China, respectively.Benzinga's Take: Coca-Cola has a strong brand and international presence. The company has the higher dividend yield of the two beverage giants. But the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner in this battle.

2021-01-27,"(Bloomberg) -- ByteDance Ltd.’s revenue more than doubled to about $35 billion last year, defying heightened global competition and Trump’s attempt to ban its signature video service TikTok in the U.S.The Chinese company managed to grow operating profit to roughly $7 billion in 2020 from less than $4 billion the prior year, a person familiar with the matter said. That’s in a year when former U.S. president Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and force its sale to American investors led by Oracle Corp. With Joe Biden in office, the company is moving closer toward listing part of its social media empire in Hong Kong. The Information first reported on ByteDance’s 2020 financials.ByteDance’s phenomenal growth stems from the global success of teen phenom TikTok and its Chinese twin Douyin, which helped pioneer a new form of social video and undercut rivals from Facebook Inc. to Tencent Holdings Ltd. Last valued at about $180 billion, the company is said to be exploring an initial public offering for some of its businesses in Hong Kong, including Douyin. A ByteDance spokesperson declined to comment.An eventual IPO would follow smaller competitor Kuaishou Technology’s impending $5.4 billion debut. Kuaishou, which operates China’s most popular video service after Douyin, is slated to list Feb. 5 in the world’s biggest internet IPO since Uber Technologies Inc.Read more: ByteDance Seeks Funds at $180 Billion Value Before IPO of AssetsBut one major uncertainty remains for ByteDance: whether the Biden administration will follow through on its predecessors’ actions.Founded by Zhang Yiming in 2012, ByteDance built TikTok into one of the most popular apps around the world, with more than 100 million users in the U.S. alone. The startup has more than quadrupled revenue from just $8 billion in 2018 and now posts sales on par with the likes of Nike Inc. and Coca-Cola Co.But the Trump administration labeled the app a security threat and banned the service last year, contending the Chinese government could compel ByteDance to turn over the data of millions of young American users. Oracle and Walmart Inc. then agreed to buy 20% of TikTok in a complex deal blessed by the former president.Biden’s immediate priorities are curbing the pandemic and resuscitating the economy, and he has had little to say so far about TikTok. It’s possible ByteDance could work out a compromise with the new president that allows it to retain full or majority ownership -- provided it can demonstrate American user data is secure.Read more: India TikTok Ban Threatens China’s Rise as Global Tech PowerBeyond the U.S., ByteDance has been stymied in India, where the government has banned scores of Chinese apps since June in the wake of deadly Himalayan border clashes. TikTok was among a clutch of services permanently banned after the latest skirmish, forcing its Chinese owner to scale back in the country, once its largest market globally.“We have steadfastly worked to comply with the Indian order from June, even as we disagreed with it,” TikTok said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “Given the lack of feedback from the government about how to resolve this issue in the subsequent seven months, it is with deep sadness that we have decided to reduce our workforce in India.”As the TikTok and Indian sagas raged, Zhang has put more effort into nascent Chinese-focused businesses from gaming and education to e-commerce, while fine-tuning ByteDance’s management structure, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing internal matters.During a December town hall meeting attended by ByteDance’s 100,000-plus employees, Zhang said TikTok’s user growth slowed in 2020’s second half because of new competition from Youtube and Snap Inc., according to attendees who asked not be identified discussing private events. But he emphasized that its growth potential still outstripped Douyin’s, they said.Read more: TikTok Tug-of-War Ensnares App’s Affable Billionaire Founder(Updates with Indian scale-back from the ninth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",TikTok’s Owner Doubles Sales to $35 Billion Despite U.S. Ban

2021-02-05,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. is planning to sell a stake in its South African bottling unit to local investors in a deal worth about 10 billion rand ($669 million), in line with an agreement with local regulators, according to people familiar with the matter.The move would help the U.S. drinks giant comply with South Africa’s policies that prescribe minimum holdings in companies for Blacks and other groups that faced economic discrimination under apartheid, said the people. The deal was a condition of Coca-Cola’s 2016 buyout of former partner SABMiller, now part of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, they said.Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa said Friday its broad-based black ownership will be increased to 20%, without giving detail on the value of the deal. Employees will have control of an approximate 15% stake, up from 5%, with the balance owned by outside investors. The plan was revised from an earlier proposal to sell a larger stake and has been agreed with regulators, according to a spokeswoman. Rothschild & Co is an adviser on the deal, the people said.The broader Coca-Cola Beverages Africa is based in the coastal town of Port Elizabeth and serves 12 countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana, according to the website. It accounts for about 40% of the Atlanta-based company’s drinks sold on the continent.The value of the entire business is about 45 billion rand, the people said, meaning the new investors are getting a discounted price.

2021-02-08,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. are uniting in a partnership that will dramatically expand the reach of Palantir’s sales force while making IBM’s own artificial-intelligence software easier for non-technical customers to use, the companies plan to announce Monday.The global partnership is the largest of its kind for Palantir, the maker of data-analysis software whose shares have more than quadrupled since its September debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Palantir gains access to a sales team of more than 2,500 people, up from its current 30. Palantir’s stock rose 10% as trading opened in New York Monday, boosting the shares to $37.53.The relationship is the payday for the project Palantir started more than a year ago to break its data integration and analysis software into smaller, less pricey modules. The Denver-based company mainly sells to companies with revenue in excess of $500 million -- many of which already have relationships with IBM.Reselling Palantir’s software to augment the data and AI tools that IBM already offers and make them easier for more people to use was “a natural” fit, said Rob Thomas, IBM’s senior vice president of software, cloud and data. “We’re going to sell it to 180 countries and thousands of customers.”Palantir’s software requires little to no coding, enabling less technical employees to use it, Thomas said. To expand IBM’s cloud and AI business, half the revenue will need to come through partnerships like the one struck with Palantir. “That’s a pretty fundamental change for us,” he said.Expanded AccessWithout providing a time frame, Thomas said he expects the partnership to help boost IBM’s customers using AI to 80% from its current 20%.Palantir Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said the technical fit with IBM and its reach are part of his company’s long-term effort to finally ramp sales. In addition to commercial customers, government contracts have surged both in number and size during the pandemic.“This is the biggest [partnership] we’ve announced -- expect more,” Sankar said. He said he expects to triple Palantir’s direct-sales team to about 100 this year, a significant hike for a company whose management once prided itself on not employing a single salesperson.Started with funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel in 2003, Palantir found early success with users at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and went on to sign the Defense Department and Internal Revenue Service, which, respectively, have used the software to locate roadside bombs and hunt tax cheats.Government ContractsMore recently the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention use Palantir’s software to help predict Covid-19 outbreaks, distribute protective gear and allocate vaccines.While Palantir’s government contracts have grown -- sometimes amid privacy and surveillance concerns -- the company’s commercial business has been slower to evolve.Palantir last reported 132 total government and commercial clients, a concentrated pool that includes BP Plc, Merck KGaA and Airbus SE. Early customers like American Express Co. and Coca-Cola Co. which experimented with low-cost Palantir software trials and later ditched them, aren’t necessarily top of Palantir’s list now, Sankar said.“We hope to win all this business back in the fullness of time,” Sankar said, adding there is no “pride list” of former customers it hopes to now re-engage.Palantir reports financial results for 2020 on Feb. 16. A shareholder lockup expires three days later, unleashing the remaining 80% of all shares that have not been eligible to trade. Palantir shares rose $2 to $34.05 on Feb. 5, giving it a stock-market value of $59.3 billion.(Updates with shares in the second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Palantir Surges on Deal to Offer Software Through IBM

2021-02-10,"After an absence of nearly four years and endless requests by its customers, McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD) is returning Hi-C Orange Lavaburst to its menu. What Happened: The non-carbonated Hi-C Orange, which is part of the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) portfolio, had been a staple at McDonald's since 1955, but was removed from the menu in May 2017 in favor of another Coca-Cola beverage, Sprite TropicBerry. Hi-C fans reacted angrily on social media to the loss of their favorite drink and began petition drives, but for years McDonald's was unmoved by the protests. ""We know fans of Hi-C Orange Lavaburst, AKA Hi-C Orange, have been craving the iconic beverage since it rolled off national menus in 2017,"" said McDonald's in a press release. ""To those who have passionately asked for us to bring it back over the years, we're excited to say we 'C' you."" What's Next: McDonald's did not offer an explanation on why it had an abrupt change of mind after a long stretch without making the drink available, but Hi-C fans are already high-fiving each other online for their victory. Hi-C Orange will be available at select McDonald's restaurants this month and is scheduled to resume its place as a soft drink option at all locations by June. The company is giving consumers the option to enter their ZIP code at the website mcdfinder.com to locate the nearest location serving the drink.

2021-02-11,"Shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) decreased by 7.51% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Coca-Cola has. Coca-Cola's Debt Based on Coca-Cola's financial statement as of October 22, 2020, long-term debt is at $39.50 billion and current debt is at $13.37 billion, amounting to $52.87 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $11.38 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $41.48 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. See also: How to Buy Coca-Cola Stock To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Coca-Cola's $97.18 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.54. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-02-11,"Coca-Cola posted better-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter, driven by an expansion of adjusted operating margin and prudent cost management. However, the resurgence of coronavirus cases in many parts of the world has kept the beverage company’s global unit case volume trends under pressure. Coca-Cola’s (KO) 4Q adjusted earnings increased 6.8% to $0.47 per share on a year-over-year basis and beat Street estimates of $0.42 per share. Adjusted net operating revenues decreased 5.5% to $8.6 billion, falling shy of analysts’ expectations of $8.63 billion. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted operating margin during the quarter expanded to 27.35% from 24.83% year-on-year. Adjusted gross margin fell 288 basis points to 57.44%. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said, “The progress we made in 2020, including the actions taken to accelerate the transformation of our company, gives us confidence in returning to growth in the year ahead. While near-term uncertainty remains, we are well-positioned to emerge stronger from the crisis, driven by our purpose and our beverages for life ambition.” For 2021, the company projects adjusted EPS to grow in a high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range, driven by 3-4% favorable currency movements. Organic revenue is anticipated to reflect high single-digit growth. Adjusted net sales are expected to be driven by a 2% to 3% currency tailwind. Free cash flow is expected at $8.5 billion. (See Coca-Cola stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the 4Q results, Merrill Lynch analyst Bryan Spillane maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $56 (12.9% upside potential) on the stock. The analyst considers the company’s “premium” valuation “justified” compared to “non-alcoholic beverage peers” as he expects Coca-Cola to “emerge from the crisis in a stronger position.” “As global vaccinations improve and other re-open related stocks begin to outperform,” Spillane believes “there will be a catch up trade for KO shares which have underperformed both peers and the broader market so far this year.” Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock. The Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 5 Buy ratings versus 5 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target stands at $56.60 and implies upside potential of about 14% to current levels. Shares have increased 5.4% over the last six months. Coca-Cola scores a 9 of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-02-12,"Once upon a time, electric trucking company Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN) was a Wall Street darling. Investors were wowed by the company’s breakthrough renewable natural gas (or RNG) technology, and its potential to address the shortcomings of electric and hydrogen technology in long-haul trucking. From June to September 2020, HYLN stock soared from $10 to $55. Source: Hyliion.com Then the hype faded. Over the past five months, HYLN stock has crashed back to $15. Why?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Mostly because there has been a notable lack of announcements from the company, at the same time that huge advancements have been made in both plug-in battery and hydrogen technology. This combination has caused investors to second-think RNG’s place in the clean energy future, and whether Hyliion will be a big player in electrifying trucking fleets. Hyliion just announced a next-generation battery module, however, which broadly implies that its RNG technology is making progress. Further, it implies Hyliion’s electric powertrains have significant advantages over legacy EV powertrains. This big announcement could be exactly what Hyliion’s sleepy stock needs to “wake up” and rebound back to $50-plus highs. Claim Your Spot in Line for Luke’s Next 10X Recommendation (Plus Free Hypergrowth newsletter) Here’s a deeper look. HYLN Stock: Traditional Renewables Not Up to Par in Trucking First, let’s understand the core bull thesis on Hyliion’s stock. It all starts with talking about the shortcomings of plug-in battery and hydrogen technology in long-haul transportation. Battery-electric trucks have range, cost and infrastructure problems. They can only travel a few hundred miles on one charge, they run at about $7 per diesel gallon equivalent (versus $3 per gallon for diesel trucks) and there are less than 10 Class 6-8 electric truck recharging stations across North America (PDF, page 10). Hydrogen trucks do better on the range part. Because hydrogen is super light, hydrogen fuel cells can be super dense. And therefore, hydrogen trucks can drive much farther on a single “charge.” But hydrogen truck still have the cost and infrastructure problems. There are also less than 10 Class 6-8 hydrogen truck refueling stations across North America, and hydrogen costs about $12 per diesel gallon equivalent. Thus, while the trucking industry needs to go green, traditional renewable energy sources are not ready to viably decarbonize the industry just yet. Fortunately, there’s another, entirely overlooked and ostensibly counterintuitive renewable energy source which is ready to immediately and cost-effectively decarbonize the trucking industry — and it’s the one that differentiate Hyliion from other players in this space. Is Renewable Natural Gas the Next Big Thing? When it comes to Hyliion’s bull case, it’s all about RNG. RNG is natural gas, just sourced from animal, industrial and food waste as opposed to fossil fuels. Sure, that means RNG still emits CO2 during the natural gas combustion process (not good for the environment). But it also means that RNG captures and uses methane in traditionally methane-rich waste, and therefore, prevents that methane for being emitted (really good for the environment). Methane is considered much, much worse in terms of global climate change than CO2, mostly because the former is better at absorbing heat. Therefore, as a process that boosts CO2 emissions, yet simultaneously reduces methane emissions, RNG is considered net carbon-negative and ultimately a big “win” for the environment … much like plug-in batteries and hydrogen. The cool thing about RNG is that it solves plug-in battery and hydrogen technology shortcomings in long-haul trucking. Range? A typical RNG truck will give you the same mileage as a diesel truck. Infrastructure? Unlike wind, hydro and solar, RNG can is a plug-and-play solution with existing natural gas infrastructure, and therefore, doesn’t require huge capital spending to work at scale. After all, there are 729 Class 6-8 natural gas refueling stations across North America. RNG can be pumped through all of those stations. Costs? Current RNG prices hover around $1 per diesel gallon equivalent, while hydrogen and electricity prices — though steadily falling — still sit staunchly north of $5. Thus, by being a clean energy source with best range, the lowest costs and an already established infrastructure, RNG is the only immediately usable technology to decarbonize trucking fleets. That’s why Deloitte projects that, by 2026, about 80% of all alternative drive systems in heavy duty trucks will be based on natural gas (PDF, pg. 4). Hyliion Comes to Market With Best-in-Breed RNG Solution Hyliion is positioned with a best-in-breed RNG truck powertrain platform — dubbed the Hypertruck ERX — that is due to start deliveries in 2021/2022. This platform will materially disrupt the trucking industry, and over the next decade, you could see a lot of UPS (NYSE:UPS), DHL, FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) trucks be built on the Hypertruck ERX powertrain. Just look at the numbers here. Hyliion consistently outperforms rivals Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The Hypertruck ERX sports the following: Driving range of 1,300 miles, ~70% more than Nikola’s hydrogen truck (750 miles) and about 160% more than Tesla’s semi-truck (500 miles). A payload capacity of 53,000 pounds, ~10% more than Nikola (48,000 pounds) and ~20% more than Tesla (43,000 pounds). A full recharge time of just 10 minutes, the same as Nikola’s hydrogen truck and one-third that of Tesla’s semi-truck. A 0-to-60 miles-per-hour pick-up time of 20 seconds, on par with Tesla’s semitruck and 10 seconds shorter than Nikola’s hydrogen truck. In other words, Hyliion’s Hypertruck ERX is the best clean energy long-haul truck technology platform in the market … meaning it is ready to lead the clean-energy disruption of the Class 8 trucking market. For a while, Wall Street forgot about Hyliion’s potential amid a noticeable absence in updates from the company. But HYLN is perking up once again because of a critical business update, which implies that the company has been busy at work fine-tuning this disruptive technology. A Breakthrough Next-Gen Battery Module This past week, Hyliion unveiled its next-generation battery module that has long battery life, higher recharging rates and improved safety. Specifically, this improved battery module is capable of up to 5X as much cycle life as a conventional EV battery, can be recharged in under 8 minutes, and allows for more than a 40% improvement in cooling compared to previous systems (which allows for higher charge and longer sustained power output). It’s a powerful solution that could be the key to waking up investor interest in Hyliion stock. Before this announcement, Hyliion had been publicly quiet for months about any technological improvements or advancements. This silence dated back to the company’s third-quarter earnings report back in early October. Not surprisingly, amid a lack of catalysts, Hyliion stock has been weak. But this is a big catalyst, and it could be exactly why Hyliion’s stock needs to wake up from its slumber and get back on a winning trajectory. Long-Term Upside Potential Is Compelling Globally, about 1.7 million heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HCVs) are sold annually. Let’s say this market follows the passenger car electrification arc, and that by 2030, more than 30% of new HCVs sold are built on alternative drive systems. That implies 500,000-plus alternative-drive HCVs sold in 2030. There will be a lot of competition fighting for those 500,000 deliveries. Tesla will win some market share with its branding power and leading electric battery technology. Nikola will win some share with its disruptive hydrogen fuel cell technology. And, yes, Hyliion will some share with its immediately usable and exceptionally cost-effective RNG powertrains. Let’s say Hyliion wins about 20% market share, implying ~100,000 units sold in 2030. The company’s internal financials imply average annual revenue per powertrain of over $60,000, while EBITDA margins at scale should rise toward 35%. Under those assumptions, Hyliion should clear $2 billion in EBITDA in 2030. High quality truck components suppliers can fetch a 15X EBITDA multiple. That implies a potential future enterprise value for Hyliion of $30-plus billion, versus a market cap of ~$3 billion today. Bottom Line on HYLN Stock Hyliion still projects as a long-term winner thanks to its unique RNG solution which is presently the best solution for decarbonizing the long-haul trucking industry. Hylion’s stock just went to sleep for a few months, amid an unusually prolonged silence from the company with respect to technological and business progress. That silence is now broken. And with it broken, HYLN looks ready to charge back into an uptrend. P.S. Have you noticed the trend lately?

2021-02-12,"XL Fleet Corp. (NASDAQ:XL) is yet another company that has come to market as a result of the SPAC boom last year. The company began being publicly traded on Dec. 22, and XL stock has been on a volatile ride since its inception. The company’s share price spiked to as high as $35 immediately following the SPAC transaction, and have since settled down closer to where shares opened on Dec. 22 around $15. XL specializes in providing an “electrification as a service” business model. The company currently has over 200 customers, with more than 3,000 of its systems deployed. This brings me to the first key reason I like this early-stage EV company. This Isn’t an Early-Stage EV Company XL is unlike many of its competitors which are simply business model ideas that have gone public via a SPAC to raise funds. This company has proven its business model works, and has large cap blue chip customers as clients. The likes of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), and Federal Express (NYSE:FDX) happen to be large customers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double XL has actually been in operations for around 10 years. This company has built a solid clientele, with meaningful revenues. The company’s business consists of providing hybrid/plug-in electrification drive systems for class 2-6 vehicles. The installation of these drive systems can take place on any standard OEM platform and don’t impact the warranty of the underlying vehicles. These drive systems provide fuel efficiency savings of up to 50% for these heavy duty vehicles. Additionally, greenhouse emissions are reduced by up to one-third. With so many blue chip players looking to meet greenhouse emission reduction targets, this is certainly going to be a booming business for a while. Thus, XL primarily provides a transitory technology taking ICE vehicles toward full electrification. That said, this is a company that has taken the execution risk component out of the equation. I like the medium-term value this stock provides right now at these levels. What Happens When Fleets Switch Over to Fully Electric Options? Significant risks with this business model do exist for long-term investors. Currently, the company’s core business focuses on turning ICE vehicles into hybrids to allow for short-term greenhouse emissions reductions. Longer-term, the company’s clientele will most likely invest in new fleets of purely EV options for its delivery services. These risks have been reflected in the company’s relatively small order backlog of around $12 million, and its lack of consistent and large repeat orders as in the past. However, expectations are that it will take decades for a majority of the cars on the road to be fully electric. The runway for XL is sufficiently long to make a long-term argument for owning this stock. This goes double if one believes XL can maintain its market position in this competitive market. (Yes, there are a number of competitors in this space). Additionally, XL appears to have a plan in place for the longer-term full electrification of fleets. XL has said it plans on introducing its own fully electric system by 2022. Such a move could be a game-changer, as investors are looking to buy what’s going to be hot 10 years from now, not necessarily what’s going to get us through the next ten years. Targets Extremely Aggressive for XL Stock The reality is investors in XL stock need to take a major leap of faith with this company, in some respects. The projections of a revenue increase from $21 million in 2020 to $647 million by 2023 is aggressive. Forget aggressive. This is an insanely high bar to pole-vault over. Yes, I think the secular trends in the electrification space are incredibly powerful. However, I do think a high degree of speculation is required to own a stock that is attempting to increase revenues more than 30-fold over a three year period. Thus, I would recommend investors bullish on this company stay patient. Personally, I’d like to see a few quarters of outperformance first before jumping on this bandwagon. That said, this SPAC-produced company is one with real, concrete potential right now. For those with a very long-term growth portfolio and a few shekels put aside, this could be an interesting small position to add.

2021-02-12,"Investors who have owned stocks since 2016 generally have experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) total return in the past five years is 132%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Coca-Cola’s Difficult Run: One company that has been a lackluster investment in the past five years is soda giant Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola investors who bought back in 2016 and held on through some extremely volatile times turned a solid profit, but they fell well short of the gains of the overall market. Coca-Cola is the textbook definition of a blue-chip dividend stock. Despite U.S. soda consumption recently hitting a 30-year low, Coca-Cola continues to generate cash flow for investors and consistently raises its 2.7% dividend. Coca-Cola spent the past five years fighting the downward trend in U.S. soda consumption by diversifying its product offerings, investing heavily in non-sugary diet sodas, tea, juice, bottled water, energy drinks, coffee and other healthier drinks. In 2018, the company announced a $3.9 billion buyout of Costa Coffee. In 2020, the company said it planned to launch hard seltzer and cola-coffee products in the near future. Coca-Cola has offset declining organic soda sales growth via new product launches, acquisitions, asset divestments, and the refranchising of its bottling operations. At the beginning of 2016, Coca-Cola shares were trading at around $42. The stock trades mostly sideways for the next 2.5 years in a range of between $40 and $50. The stock finally broke out to the upside in mid-2019, eventually topping out at $60.13 in early 2020 prior to the pandemic sell-off. Related Link: ,000, 5 Years Later: Disney Stock Finds Its Magic Kingdom Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic slammed Coca-Cola’s business, shutting down major events and restaurants and crushing soda demand. The March 2020 pandemic sell-off sent Coca-Cola shares all the way down to as low as $36.27, its low point of the past five years. Since then, Coca-Cola has struggled to regain traction in a socially distanced world Coca-Cola In 2021, Beyond: Coca-Cola shares made it back up to as high as $54.93 in early 2021 before pulling back to around $50. Ultimately, Coca-Cola investors who bought five years ago and held have generated a modest profit. In fact, $1,000 in Coca-Cola stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $1,373 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting Coca-Cola to continue to recover in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 22 analysts covering the stock is $56.50, suggesting 12.7% upside from current levels.

2021-02-16,"Rather than hoping for better days, investors should consider generating some income on their shares by using “covered calls.”",Coca-Cola Stock Is Going Nowhere. Here’s What to Do With It.
2021-02-17,"Last week, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) revealed their fourth quarter results. Although these two rivals are very comparable in terms of value, stock, and dividends, their business models are significantly different. These differences were emphasized by their Q4 results. Coca Cola just closed a rough fiscal year characterized by sharply reduced consumer mobility in which it lost market share and saw rare declines in sales volume, earnings, and cash flow. Its focus on away-from-home drink sales made it extremely vulnerable to the pandemic compared to more diversified PepsiCo. Coca Cola Had A Mixed Quarter Coke's business is heavily dependent on food-away-from-home consumption and that market is still far from going back to normal. Although things should improve later in the year, for now, the pandemic is still dragging the company down. The Q4 revenue came in at $8.6 billion, 5.5% from last year's results and slightly worse than expected. Weakness in the EU, Mideast/Africa region and North America was a bit offset by a slight improvement in Latin America. But on an organic basis, revenue fell by 3% worldwide versus the 3.7% expected, which is a rare piece of truly good news in the report. The figure is also better than the 4% slump it reported in the third quarter as COVID-19 continues to keep people away from restaurants, sports events, and concerts. Sales volumes continued to drop, but trends improved compared to the most recent quarters. If anything, Cokeended its market share slide in the fourth quarter, which points to a brighter year ahead. Moving further down the report, the company's margins improved on a YoY basis, but only in line with the consensus as the adjusted operating margin of 27.3% drove slightly better-than-expected earnings. The takeaway is that Coca-Cola's revenue and earnings shrank on both a quarterly and annual basis in 2020. But despite the tough environment, Coke's finances did benefit from aggressive cost cuts, resulting in just a minor earnings shortfall for 2020. Cash flow for the year was also down but still positive enough to support rising dividend payments. In order to preserve financial flexibility, management dramatically reduced stock repurchase spending. As for 2021, management expects mid-to-high-single-digit revenue growth and mid-to-low-single-digit EPS growth. Pepsi Was Growing On the other hand, Pepsi, whose business is tilted toward retail revenue has been steadily growing its beverage and snack food businesses all year long amid the COVID-19 apocalypse. PepsiCo actually grew its revenue in the fourth quarter and in 2020, which puts it in a much better position. It generated $22.46 billion in revenue, which represents an 8.8% quarterly growth and 4.8% annual growth. The revenue strength was driven by a 5.7% surge in organic sales. Moving down the report, Pepsi's earnings are similar to Coke's with GAAP missed by a small margin, but with the end result is quite different as its earnings are up for the year whereas Coke's are down. PepsiCo is also forecasting growth in 2021. The Key Difference Is Size Along with Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite and Fanta, The Coca Cola Company has a growing portfolio of non-sparkling soft drinks that includes Vitamin water, Minute Maid, Costa Coffee and others, along with owning a stake in energy drink maker Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) and growing sports drink company BodyArmor. But due to its huge portfolio of food brands, PepsiCo is a much larger and better diversified company. Both stocks are great dividend payers with long histories and great track records behind them. Both companies have sound balance sheets, which put them on a par in terms of safety and payout. But PepsiCo delivered stronger results along with better growth prospects. Outlook Coke's business is closely tied to consumers attending in-person entertainment events, so things can't go back to normal before COVID-19 leaves the picture. Management warned of volatility given the uncertainty about further outbreaks and the shaky outlook of the global economy. Yet despite sales still trending lower through early February, the beverage titan is feeling confident enough to reinstate its annual outlook after withdrawing it earlier last year. The beverage giant's revenue trends are expected to continue lagging Pepsi, which has already recovered the momentum it lost during the early days of the pandemic. Coca-Cola might have a strong brand and international presence, along with a slightly higher dividend yield of the two but the growing food portfolio of PepsiCo and the consecutive years of revenue growth could make the food and beverage giant the winner of fizzy wars.

2021-02-19,"Coca-Cola raised its quarterly cash dividend by 2.4% to $0.42 per share. This marks the beverage company’s 59th consecutive year of dividend increases. Coca-Cola (KO) announced that the new dividend will be paid on April 1, to shareholders of record as of March 15. Shares closed at $50.77 on Feb. 18, up nearly 1.3%. The company’s annual dividend of $1.68 per share now reflects a dividend yield of 3.3%. On Feb. 10, Coca-Cola reported 4Q results. The company’s 4Q adjusted earnings increased 6.8% to $0.47 per share on a year-over-year basis and beat Street estimates of $0.42 per share. Adjusted net operating revenues decreased 5.5% to $8.6 billion, falling just shy of analysts’ expectations of $8.63 billion. For 2021, the company projects adjusted EPS to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percentage range. (See Coca-Cola stock analysis on TipRanks) On Feb. 10, Merrill Lynch analyst Bryan Spillane maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $56 (10.3% upside potential) on the stock. The analyst considers the company’s “premium” valuation “justified” compared to “non-alcoholic beverage peers” as he expects Coca-Cola to “emerge from the crisis in a stronger position.” “As global vaccinations improve and other re-open related stocks begin to outperform,” Spillane believes “there will be a catch up trade for KO shares which have underperformed both peers and the broader market so far this year.” Wall Street analysts are cautiously optimistic about the stock. The Moderate Buy consensus rating breaks down into 6 Buy ratings versus 5 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target stands at $57 and implies upside potential of about 12% to current levels. Shares have increased 7% over the last six months. Coca-Cola scores a 9 out of 10 from TipRanks’ Smart Score system, indicating that the stock has strong potential to outperform market expectations.

2021-02-19,"Coca-Cola Co's (NYSE: KO)'s dividend got a little sweeter Thursday. Coca-Cola approved the company’s 59th consecutive annual dividend increase, raising the quarterly dividend 2.4% from 41 cents to 42 cents per common share. The dividend increase is applicable for outstanding shares of Coca-Cola. A report Friday from BevNet revealed that Coke might move forward in acquiring popular sports drink BodyArmor. “We can confirm that The Coca-Cola Company has filed a pre-acquisition notification with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) relating to its intent to acquire a controlling interest in BodyArmor,” Coke told BevNET. “In 2018, Coca-Cola became a shareholder in BodyArmor, in a deal that was structured to create value for both companies while also defining a path to ownership in the future. Until closing, both companies will continue to operate independently in accordance with their existing agreement.” Why It Matters: The Coke brand is far more than soda pop in 2021, what with the family of drink choices consisting of health-conscious, nutritious options like Smart Water, Honest Teas and fairlife dairy products. It can be said BodyArmor is a direct competitor to Coke’s popular electrolyte sports drink Powerade. The acquisition would allow Coke to further expand its market share in the sports drink space. KO Price Action: Shares of Coca-Cola were trading down 0.27% at $50.60 at last check Friday. Coke has a 52-week high of $60 and a 52-week low of $36.27. See Also: How To Buy Coca-Cola Stock.

2021-02-28,"(Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak can do self-restraint. After an addiction to drinking full-strength Coca-Cola resulted in seven fillings to his teeth, he rationed himself to a single Coke a week.When he comes to deliver his budget on Wednesday, the chancellor of the exchequer faces a battle to persuade his colleagues of the need to turn down the flow of government spending, and to address the painful hole in the public finances, approaching 400 billion pounds ($558 billion).The question he’s still grappling with is how to pay the bill. Will he raise taxes, hitting the wealthy and clawing back profits from the few businesses that made them, as some suggest? Or will he prepare the ground for cuts to public spending? Or will he instead signal that the pain of cuts and taxes will have to come, but just not yet?Sunak’s answers will shape his own fortunes, the Conservative government’s political identity, and the U.K. economy’s chances of making a full recovery from its deepest recession for 300 years.“We went big, we went early, but there is more to come and there will be more to come in the budget. But there is a challenge,” with public finances and “I want to level with people about the challenge,” Sunak told the Financial Times in an interview Friday. In common with finance ministers around the world, Sunak poured out vast sums of taxpayers’ cash to save jobs and businesses when coronavirus forced the government to shut shops and restaurants and confine people to their homes.Now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has laid out his “road map” for a cautious four-month lifting of the lockdown, Sunak is reconciled to keeping that flow of support going for as long as the restrictions are in place.What Bloomberg Economics Says…“The rise in bond yields over the past month, if it sticks, would mean debt interest costs as a share of GDP average 1.2% over the five years rather than 1%. Debt servicing costs have averaged 1.7% since 2000.”— Dan Hanson, senior economist. Click here for the full report.That will mean extending the 54 billion-pound furlough wage support program, along with cuts to business rates and sales tax at least until the end of June. This won’t be a surprise to Sunak’s colleagues and will please many, but not all, Conservative members of Parliament on Wednesday.But it runs against the grain of his instincts as a small-state Conservative, and many of his colleagues are also deeply uneasy about the economic policy their Tory government finds itself pursuing. The prospect of hiking taxes – including potentially a sharp rise in business levies – to pay the bill is particularly hard for most Tories to swallow.In recent weeks, the chancellor has been working assiduously to canvass his colleagues’ views in an effort to understand what he’s up against and tailor his messages to match. Some MPs report being invited to four or five Zoom calls with Sunak in the run-up to his budget.“Rishi was very open, very listening, really cared about what we were saying,” said Alexander Stafford, one of the new Tory MPs elected in December 2019. “We all know there are going to be cuts or tax rises. My hope is none of that falls too hard at the moment. We’re not out of the woods yet.”Others put it more bluntly. “If he were to raise taxes, it would undermine everything we’ve done to get businesses to this stage,” said Andrew Bridgen. “No society can ever tax its way to prosperity.”Among the details emerging on the plan, Sunak will pledge 22 billion pounds for a previously proposed infrastructure bank to boost the country's green economy, the Treasury said in a statement on Saturday. The bank will offer a range of products, including equity, loans and guarantees, to support projects in sectors such as renewable energy, carbon capture and storage and transportation. He's also expected to announce the launch of a fund that would channel up to 375 million pounds into fast-growing tech start-ups.What Else Will Be in Sunak’s Budget? A new state-backed loan program to help companies recover from the pandemic Extensions to the main virus support measures, including the furlough program, a reduction in VAT and the business rates holiday More details on how a proposed infrastructure bank will work An extension to the 20 pounds uplift in universal credit, a welfare payment 126 million pounds of new funding for 40,000 traineeships A signal that corporation tax is set to rise, possibly to 25% by the end of the parliament, according to the Sunday Times A freeze on the pension lifetime allowance, and on the point at which people start paying the basic rate of income tax, according to the Times A 5 billion-pound fund for pubs, restaurants and non-essential stores, according to the Sunday Telegraph A possible tax on every internet delivery, according to the Telegraph A fourth round of 3-month grants to self-employed people at up to 80% of their pre-pandemic earningsSteve Baker, a Tory who sits on the Treasury committee and will interrogate Sunak on his choices, said the government’s priority must be to create better-paid jobs for people in the months ahead. “I just don’t see how raising taxes promotes more, better, higher paying jobs for the public,” he said.The pandemic has fundamentally challenged the Tory party’s sense of what it stands for. In the past, Conservatives have flirted with privatizing state healthcare, cut welfare payments, and slashed taxes for high earners.What Bloomberg Economics Says…""The rise in bond yields over the past month, if it sticks, would mean debt interest costs as a share of GDP average 1.2% over the five years rather than 1%.

Click here full reportYet Johnson’s team now paints itself as the champions of the National Health Service while pumping up social security and weighing options to raise levies on capital gains.The influx of more than 100 new Conservative Members of Parliament in 2019, many of them representing northern seats prised from the left-wing Labour Party for the first time in decades, has changed the makeup of the party in Westminster.There’s less clamor for fiscal prudence than in years gone by, and there’s certainly no appetite for the return of the austerity policies pursued over much of the last decade by Tory-led administrations.Historically low interest rates mean there also isn’t pressure from the bond markets on the chancellor to rein in his spending immediately. While the country’s debt has ballooned during the crisis, the cost of servicing it has actually fallen.Yet Sunak sees big risks in doing nothing to address the U.K.’s pandemic-ravaged public finances. Even if he delays most of the difficult decisions until the next budget in the fall, or even next year, many of his colleagues expect he won’t be able to put off the pain any further.Bond markets are signaling that Sunak’s borrowing costs may only get higher. Interest rates on gilts in financial markets have risen a half percentage point in the past month for securities maturing in six years and beyond. The yield on the Treasury’s benchmark 10-year gilt reached 0.836% on Friday, the highest since March 2020 when the pandemic began spreading widely in Europe. Every 1 percentage-point increase in interest rates adds 25 billion pounds to the U.K.’s cost of servicing its debt, Sunak told the FT.“We all know that the markets can turn very, very quickly,” Harriet Baldwin, a Conservative who traded bonds during a market rout in 1994. “Although the situation is very favorable at the moment, it’s not necessarily always going to be the case. He’s got a tricky tightrope to walk.”Observers praise Sunak for his work ethic and attention to detail, and the chancellor himself has said he likes to start his day with a workout, either on a treadmill, in the gym, or on a stationary bicycle, before getting to his desk at 7:45 a.m.The truth is, no amount of sweat or preparation can guarantee Sunak’s policies will succeed. The biggest factor in determining whether Britain’s economy is permanently scarred or recovers quickly lies beyond the chancellor’s control: the pandemic itself.If, despite a fast and apparently effective vaccination program, Johnson’s government cannot keep a grip on coronavirus, the U.K.’s plan to reopen the economy on a cautious timetable of dates over the next four months will be at risk. So too will party unity.“All hell will break loose if the dates are challenged or they slip back,” said Indiana-born Joy Morrissey, who was elected under Johnson’s leadership in 2019. “These dates are the last possible dates everyone is going to accept.”(Adds comment from Bloomberg Economics.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","Sunak Plots Tax Raid to Plug U.K. Deficit, Risking Tory Rage"

The Coca-Cola Thesis: RBC downgraded Coca-Cola's stock in January amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. But weeks later, Modi says, the health situation took a turn for the better and the pandemic ""seems to have stabilized in the US"" and other international markets. Modi said expectations for a ""material increase"" in consumer mobility amid better weather in the coming months represent a catalyst for Coca-Cola's stock. Other factors that make the case for a return back to some form of normalcy include stay-at-home fatigue, a ""fairly efficient"" vaccine distribution, reduction in vaccine hesitancy, and better knowledge on how to protect against the virus.

2021-03-26,"What are blue-chip stocks? The traditional definition of a blue-chip is “a huge company with an excellent reputation.” The problem is that traditional blue-chip stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and General Electric (NYSE:GE) keep falling from grace. Scandals, prioritizing dividends over running the business and making bad acquisitions keep taking “safe” investments down.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips My definition of a blue-chip is a stock you can buy and ignore. It should have benefits particular to you. This means different kinds of stocks can be blue-chip stocks. Growth companies can be blue-chips, if you’re young and growth-oriented. Tech stocks can be blue-chips, if their management isn’t stupid. Then there are the traditional dividend stocks; the ones that pay you to own them. This week I went in search of blue-chip stocks for every kind of investor. I looked at what they offer and what type of investor might find them desirable. I looked for franchises that are durable — the plays you can stay in for a decade. Hopefully there are no GEs in here, but that’s the problem with today’s market. You can never tell. All you can do is spread your bets and look at them again every few years. 7 Risky Stocks Ready to Roll on Reopening Let’s take a look at these seven blue-chip stocks with definitions to fit every type of investor: General Motors (NYSE:GM) Penn National (NASDAQ:PENN) Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) 3M (NYSE:MMM) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Blue-Chip Stocks: General Motors (GM): The Electric-Car Future Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com The future is in electric cars. But Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already taken that idea to the skies. With its market capitalization of $615 billion, it’s worth as much as the rest of the industry put together. Investors looking for a safer way to play the electric revolution are taking another look at General Motors. Over the last year GM stock is up 163%. Despite this, it still trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13, on 2020 sales of $122 billion. Compare that to $147 billion in revenue during 2018. Electric cars, however, are what we used to call a “mega trend.” It’s an idea with legs. GM has big plans for electrics, which could represent 40% of their sales by 2025. Its Ultium battery and electric motor system will also power cars from Honda (NYSE:HMC) and Audi (OTCMKTS:AUDVF). CEO Mary Barra has been preparing for this turn since taking the job back in 2014. The idea is to use profits from gas-powered cars to make GM a tech company, based not just on electric drivetrains but on self-driving intellectual property. Most companies won’t make the turn to this new model. GM is determined that it will. Penn National (PENN): A Blue-Chip for Bros Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Young investors like action. Young male investors, called “bros,” like gambling. There’s a lot of new action in gambling, and one way they’re playing it is with Penn National. Over the last year, the bros have looked brilliant. Penn National is up 647%, not on the strength of its small casinos, many in Pennsylvania, but on its big plans in internet and sports betting. This started with a stake in Barstool Sports, a tout site fronted by Dave Portnoy but backed by former Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) executive Peter Chernin. Penn has been working with experienced sports-betting partners to turn this into Barstool Sportsbook, combining mobile-phone sports bets with community features. It will be rolled out wherever it’s made legal. The pandemic has helped make this exciting. A 2018 decision let all states take sports bets, but only now are they moving to take it, because they need the tax money. That should mean rapid growth for Barstool and for its Hollywood Casino app, which takes traditional casino bets. 7 Value Stocks Everyone Is Ignoring The bros seem all-in on the trend, which has years of growth ahead of it. Europeans have been doing this kind of gambling for years and so have people in Asia. It’s a whole new world, and not all the winning bets are going to be on Wall Street. Starbucks (SBUX): The Very Model of a Modern Blue-Chip Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com When I was in college, back in the 1970s, retailers like Sears (OTCMKTS:SHLDQ) were considered blue-chip investments. Today, that crown is held by companies like Starbucks. Starbucks has entered those ranks thanks to its long-term value. Over the last five years the shares are up 87%, and the dividend has more than doubled. CEO Kevin Johnson may be overpaid, but he has been a worthy successor to Howard Schultz, who built the company on convenience and sugar-laced drinks. Johnson has made Starbucks a tech company, with a mobile app that is even involved in Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). The company’s move into China is so strong that Beijing reached out to Schultz to help repair U.S.-China relations. Starbucks was hurt during the pandemic, but it didn’t drop its dividend. It should come back strong as the pandemic eases. More than half the analysts following it say you should buy it. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has made Starbucks its top consumer name for 2021. Most of this good news, unfortunately, is already baked into the stock. One broker has a hold rating on it even while expecting earnings to double. But if you’re not timing the market, if you’re buying for the long term, these are the kind of blue-chip stocks you’re looking for. 3M (MMM): Long-Term Stability and a Reliable Dividend Source: Shutterstock 3M is an old-style blue-chip. It’s a true “dividend aristocrat,” with a dividend that has been growing steadily higher for 62 years. The business of 3M is based on turning chemicals into products for consumers and industry. Consumers know about their Post-It notes and duct tape, good for almost everything (except, ironically, taping ducts). During the pandemic, people thought of it first for its Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), like N95 masks. While 3M’s healthcare and safety units led the way in 2020, CEO Mike Roman expects the industrial group, grinders and coatings, and filtration products to lead the way in 2021. The stock was on sale through most of 2020, however, after it was said to have overpaid for Acelity, a wound care specialist, in 2019. At one point, this had the yield on that dividend up to 5%. It’s still respectable, over 3%. The P/E multiple is over 20, but that may fall as the industry deals with post-pandemic supply-chain concerns. These, in turn, should keep 3M product prices firm in the face of rising demand. Take Your Profits! 7 Covid Winners to Sell Now Speculators will run away from 3M. There are many better places to go for capital gains. But if you like steady income, better than you can get from a government bond, this is one of the blue-chip stocks worth holding. JPMorgan Chase (JPM): It’s About More Than the Money Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com When business is good, many analysts see big banks as the ultimate blue-chip play. That includes banks like JPMorgan Chase. But the nature of the money business is changing. The business of collecting deposits, making loans and handling payments is moving online. That may be why, of all the big banks, the best one to buy today is — JPMorgan Chase. The reason can be found in its most recent quarterly report. The bank made over $6 billion from trading operations in just one quarter. Moving big pots of money takes big capital. It’s one area of banking where size matters. JPMorgan has more assets than any other U.S. bank, over $3.2 trillion. When they say the deal is done, the deal is done. The bank’s traditional niches in taking deposits and making loans are under threat from fintech. The bank is waiting for weakness in the sector before pouncing. Meanwhile, the shares are up 69% over the last year, and it still has a P/E ratio of just 17.4. As with all true blue-chips, however, you don’t need to time your purchases of JPMorgan. Just hold on to it. Over the last five years, JPM averaged capital gains of 30% per year, and the dividend has doubled. Coca-Cola (KO): Looking to Get its Mojo Back Source: focal point / Shutterstock.com If we were discussing blue-chip investments a decade ago, one of the first names we would talk about would be Coca-Cola Co. Coca-Cola has been trading on the New York Stock Exchange since 1919. The company practically built its home city of Atlanta, which is based on trading, marketing and a positive attitude. Right now, the stock is a bargain, with a dividend of 3.23% But Coke’s long-time refusal to go outside its niche of potable water is hurting it. CEO James Quincey is fiddling around the edges, with smaller can sizes for health, investments in new sports drinks like BodyArmor and a “big bet” on Coke Zero. But for many investors, including this Atlantan, rival PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) now makes more sense, thanks to its investments in food companies Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats.

Apple (AAPL): The Biggest Company in the World Source: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com The late Steve Jobs built a product legend at Apple. His successor, Tim Cook, has made Apple a legendary investment. Cook has done far more than manage Jobs’ products like the iPhone. He has made Apple the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap over $2 trillion. If you had bought 100 shares of Apple the day Cook became CEO on Jobs’ death, in August 2011, you would now have 2,800 shares, each worth more than half what one of those 100 was worth then. You would also have a dividend, instituted in 2012, that has more than doubled over that time. Cook has made Apple into a Cloud Czar with its own network of hyperscale data centers. Services now represent 14% of the business. The company created the Apple Watch under Cook, and the wearables unit is now growing even faster than the phone. It’s hard to see rapid growth from sales of $275 billion, but Apple still has opportunities in health, entertainment, banking and even cars to consider. Apple phones are the platform on which the future runs, and its cloud is what makes that platform invaluable. If I were to recommend one stock to a conservative investor, it would be this one.

2021-03-28,"Activists in Georgia are attempting to organize a boycott of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) for not coming out strongly against the state’s new voting law. The Activists’ Demands: Leaders of the AME Sixth Episcopal District, which encompasses more than 500 predominantly Black churches in Georgia, have criticized the Atlanta-based company for not aggressively voicing its opposition to the changes in the state’s election laws. The new measures include additional identification requirements for absentee ballots and restrictions on drop boxes for collecting absentee ballots. Critics of the law have argued it represents a new effort at voter suppression, with President Joe Biden referring to it as “Jim Crow in the 21st century.” Bishop Reginald Jackson, presiding prelate of the AME Sixth Episcopal District, told a rally in Atlanta, “If Coca-Cola wants Black and brown people to drink their product, then they must speak up when our rights, our lives and our very democracy as we know it is under attack. “Boycotting is not something we really want to do. Coca-Cola is a fine company. But at the same time, we think all of these major companies have responsibilities on issues of social justice.” The Coca-Cola Experience: On March 26, Coca-Cola issued a statement that said, “We believe voting is a foundational right in America, and access should be broad-based and inclusive.” The company added it was “active with the Metro Atlanta Chamber in expressing our concerns and advocating for positive change in voting legislation ... We will continue to identify opportunities for engagement and strive for improvements aimed at promoting and protecting the rights to vote in our home state and elsewhere.” Coca-Cola has a history of supporting the cause of racial equality. During the 1950s, the company was among the first to prominently feature Black entertainers and athletes in its advertising. In 1964, when Atlanta’s corporate leaders initially refused to participate in a special event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s winning of the Nobel Peace Prize, Coca-Cola’s then-CEO J. Paul Austin stepped forward first by securing a corporate presence at the event. The city’s other corporate leaders then followed his lead. The company exited the South African market in 1986 in protest of the apartheid policies, selling its business interests to a multiracial investors group. However, in 2000 Coca-Cola was ordered to pay $156 million to settle a federal lawsuit brought by a group of Black employees accusing the company of racial discrimination. CEO James Quincey has referred to the circumstances leading up to the lawsuit as a “grave” error, stating, “As the judge said, our biggest issue was not that we made mistakes and that there were individual cases, but that when we knew, we didn’t act to remedy and improve.” What Happens Next: Other activist groups have been seeking to move Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game from Atlanta and the PGA of America’s Masters tournament out of Augusta in protest of the new legislation. Biden told reporters on Friday that the Justice Department was ""taking a look"" at the new Georgia measures, but admitted he was uncertain if the federal government could have it nullified. ""We don't know quite exactly what we can do at this point,"" he said. Photo courtesy Coca-Cola South Africa.

2021-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Shares of ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese parent of hit video app TikTok, are trading at a valuation of more than $250 billion in the secondary market, according to people familiar with the matter.The Beijing-based startup’s value has surged in recent weeks as investors gain confidence in the business and founder Zhang Yiming weighs options for an initial public offering, said the people, asking not to be named because the transactions are private. ByteDance was valued at $140 billion during its last fundraising, according to CB Insights.The company’s shares traded at a roughly $200 billion valuation in private transactions just a month ago, one of the people said. At $250 billion, ByteDance would be more valuable than Exxon Mobil Corp. or Coca-Cola Co.“ByteDance is one of the few top Chinese internet companies that have yet to go public, one with good business growth, talent and products,” said Shawn Yang, managing director at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors. “This is something hot money will go after.”A representative for the company didn’t respond to requests for comment.Zhang, who founded ByteDance in 2012, has demonstrated the rare ability to create repeated hit services in competition with giants like Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. His first big success was the news service Toutiao, which has since been eclipsed by TikTok and Douyin, a twin video app for China’s domestic market. The company’s revenue more than doubled to about $35 billion last year.ByteDance tangled with former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, which vowed to force the Chinese company to sell TikTok because of alleged national security concerns. But the Biden administration has said it will reassess the situation, opening the door to ByteDance retaining part or all of the fast-growing business.Zhang just hired Xiaomi Corp.’s Chew Shou Zi as his chief financial officer, fueling speculation over the social media giant’s plans to go public. Chew oversaw Xiaomi’s initial public offering as finance chief more than two years ago and would give ByteDance a seasoned CFO to reassure investors. Chew had overseen Xiaomi’s smartphone international expansion before his departure.ByteDance had been exploring plans to list some of its businesses including Douyin in Hong Kong, Bloomberg News reported in November. But it is increasingly likely that Zhang would take his whole company public, one of the people said.Among the backers who stand to benefit from an IPO are Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and SoftBank Group Corp.ByteDance’s smaller rival Kuaishou Technology went public in February in Hong Kong to feverish investor demand. Its stock more than doubled from its IPO price and its valuation pushed north of $140 billion. That performance may be prompting a reevaluation of TikTok’s parent, with some investors recently asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares, the people said.ByteDance still faces regulatory uncertainty. Besides the unresolved U.S. administration effort to force a potential TikTok sale, Beijing regulators have embarked on a wide-ranging effort to crack down on the country’s powerful technology giants.President Xi Jinping warned in March the government will go after so-called “platform” companies that have amassed data and market power. Beijing is considering the creation of a state-backed entity that would oversee the lucrative data that tech companies collect from customers, people familiar with the matter have said.(Updates with analyst comment in fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",ByteDance Valued at $250 Billion in Private Trades

2021-03-30,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co. is weighing options for its bottling business in Africa, including a sale or initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.The soft drinks giant holds 66.5% of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and is speaking with potential advisers about its exit options, the people said, asking not to be named as the details aren’t public. A sale or IPO of the stake could value the African business at about $6 billion, the people said. This could change depending on the level of buyer interest, the people said.Deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty they’ll lead to a sale or IPO, according to the people. A representative for the African business referred queries to Coca-Cola, which declined to comment.Coca-Cola initially tried to offload the stake in 2017, when it drew interest from the likes of Heineken NV and Coca-Cola HBC AG, Bloomberg News reported at the time. It had acquired the majority holding less than a year earlier, when it paid $3.15 billion to buy Anheuser-Busch InBev out of the African bottling joint venture.The Coca-Cola Beverages Africa business serves 13 countries, including Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana, according to its website. It accounts for about 40% of the Atlanta-based company’s drinks sold on the continent. Coca-Cola concluded a deal earlier this year to increase local shareholding in its South Africa bottling unit.A year of global Covid-19 lockdowns at restaurants, amusement parks and stadiums have disrupted Coca-Cola’s global businesses. Organic sales fell 3% in the quarter ended Dec. 31 amid ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Still, the drop was less severe than analyst forecasts and Coca-Cola has predicted high-single digit revenue growth for 2021 as more of the world’s population gets vaccinated.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Coca-Cola Considers Options for $6 Billion Africa Unit

2021-04-01,"(Bloomberg) -- After long careers and arduous ascensions to the top of corporate America, some 72 Black executives found themselves in recent days facing a unique moment -- an opportunity to emerge from the comfort of executive suites, boardrooms, and inner sanctums of Wall Street, and take a stand on an issue that they say greatly impacts all Americans, especially those of color.This new Black power began to take shape Sunday. Three days earlier, the Georgia state legislature had passed a sweeping GOP-backed voting rights bill, which critics say seeks to disenfranchise Black voters by making it more difficult to participate in elections. Republicans are pushing similar bills that opponents say will restrict voting for ethnic-minority voters in dozens of more states.On Sunday, Ken Chenault, the former longtime chief executive officer of American Express Co. spoke by phone with Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of drugmaker Merck & Co. The two began to sketch out a plan to write an open letter addressed directly to “Corporate America,” demanding it publicly oppose discriminatory measures designed to limit Americans’ ability to vote.“We decided that what we could do that will be most impactful was to put together for the first time a group of African-American executives in the corporate sector, have them come together on a social issue, and there was no more important issue than the right to vote,” Chenault said in an interview. “There are no excuses this time.”Chenault and Frazier began making calls and sending emails to the relative few others who have attained the kind of power that they have, and within hours they amassed an ad-hoc coalition of the Black power elite -- including Starbucks Corp. Chairwoman Mellody Hobson, Carnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald, and former Citigroup Inc. vice chairman and New York City mayoral candidate Ray McGuire. The purpose of reaching out to the others was a very necessary, perhaps overdue, call-to-action, said Chenault.Frazier, who has been a staunch voice on racial justice while serving as one of only a handful of Black executives helming a Fortune 500 company, called Debra Lee, former CEO of ViacomCBS Inc.’s BET Networks. Lee was immediately engaged in the idea. After George Floyd’s death last year, Lee said, it became clear that “if government is going to fail to act, it falls upon corporate leaders to act.”Co-founder of Gennx360 Capital Partners Ronald Blaylock said his communications lines were buzzing Sunday. He received text messages from Charles Phillips, the co-chair of the Black Economic Alliance and the former president of Oracle Corp. And, Blaylock had an email from the “two Kens,” he recalled. “If you get a note from Ken Frazier and Ken Chenault, you know it’s worth paying attention to,” he said.Upon reading more about the recent legislation, Blaylock knew immediately that the open letter was something he needed to be very visible in supporting. “Business executives now feel they can’t be bystanders,” he said in an interview.Blaylock added that the list of signatories is a tight-knit group, because “unfortunately” there aren’t many more Black executives like them. “I know probably 90% of the people on that list fairly well,” he said. “It was a quick groundswell.”There will be just five Black CEOs in the S&P 500 after Frazier retires from Merck at the end of June, including Roz Brewer, who took over at Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. on March 15, the only Black woman.Ultimately, the group partnered with the BEA -- a political action committee that some of them are members of -- and together they published a full-page advertisement in Wednesday’s New York Times. It called on corporate America to take a “non-partisan” stance “against those who seek to employ unjust and undemocratic laws in order to divide us and thwart the will of the people.” The group said that the state of “Georgia is backtracking on the hard-won right to vote.”The new Georgia law requires voters to provide a state-issued identification card when requesting an absentee ballot, limits drop boxes, and lets any Georgian challenge the voting eligibility of an unlimited number of voters, among other restrictions.Before and after the bill’s passage, most major corporations took no public position on it. Some Atlanta-based firms, including Delta Air Lines Inc. and Coca-Cola Co., were criticized for their failure to oppose the bill, prompting voting rights activists to threaten boycotts.Values MismatchDelta CEO Ed Bastian changed course Wednesday, saying in a memo to employees that Georgia’s new voting law “does not match Delta’s values.” Bastian said Delta and other companies had some success in eliminating the law’s “most suppressive tactics,” but he said the final version of the bill remained unacceptable.Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said on CNBC on Wednesday that the company has “always opposed” legislation that restricts voter access in Georgia. He said that Coke decided to share its stance publicly now that the bill has passed and that the company will continue to advocate for change both privately and publicly.After the Black leaders spoke, other companies also began to take public positions on the legislation:Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith issued a statement saying the company recently decided to invest “substantially” in Atlanta, and is “concerned” about the election law.MetLife Inc. defended everyone’s right to vote, but did not mention Georgia.In a LinkedIn post, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc., said that “voting is not just a right, but a vital component of civil activity.”Steve Squeri, the CEO of AmEx, said in a statement that the company will stand against any efforts to suppress voting.National DisgraceThe Georgia law is reverberating with Black corporate leaders beyond the list of those who signed the letter. Citigroup Inc. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason, one of the most powerful Black executives on Wall Street, called the new voting law in Georgia a disgrace and vowed to fight similar efforts afoot in other states. Citigroup employs thousands of workers in places including Texas, Missouri and Kentucky where similar legislation has been proposed.With similar GOP-backed legislation brewing in some 43 other states, the group of Black executives, most of whom grew up during the Civil Rights era, have found in this moment an opportunity to together leverage all of the power that they have worked so hard to obtain.Chenault said they did not want to see companies simply release statements in opposition to the new legislation. Instead, he said, they want those at the seat of power inside corporations to wield their influential resources, dispatch their lobbyists, and utilize other powerful tools to make their position known.Corporate leaders “don’t need to be taught how to do this,” Chenault said. “They do it every day. We’re asking they use their influence.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Sunday Phone Calls Mobilized Black Business Elite on Vote Rights

2021-04-03,"The 2021 March Madness Tournament was welcomed back with open arms by players, schools, networks and sponsors after the cancellation of the 2020 tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year’s 2021 NCAA Tournament even saw an appearance by Grand Canyon University, a school that is connected to publicly traded Grand Canyon Education Inc (NASDAQ: LOPE) via a revenue share deal for education services. Here is a look at stocks that could be impacted by the Final Four in the NCAA March Madness Tournament. ViacomCBS Inc (NASDAQ: VIAC): The Final Four and NCAA Men’s Basketball Championship games will be aired on CBS, a network owned by ViacomCBS Inc. CBS, along with networks from Turner Sports, has aired all of the games in the tournament. The Final Four games will air on CBS Sat. April 3 and Mon. April 5. A concert featuring Miley Cyrus will be part of the programming Saturday, airing between the two Final Four games. Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE): Apparel company Nike is a big sponsor of college sports teams. Nike is the sponsor of seven of the eight teams that made the Elite Eight and sponsors three of the Final Four teams. The lone team it did not sponsor is UCLA, which will become a Nike-sponsored school later this year. Fans tuning in will see Nike logos on jerseys, shorts and likely on many of the shoes worn by players in the tournament. This creates millions of dollars in media exposure for a company like Nike. Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA): This company isn't going to do as well as it had hoped in this March Madness. The lone school in the Final Four and from the Elite Eight that was not a Nike-sponsored school is UCLA. UCLS is returning to the Elite Eight for the first time in nearly 15 years and yet its shirt sponsor Under Armour is missing out on the media exposure. That's because Under Armour's 15-year $280 million sponsorship deal with UCLA is now the subject of a lawsuit from the school, after the apparel company decided to lower its sponsorship spending. Players on the UCLA team are covering up the Under Armour logos on their jerseys, and many are wearing Nike shoes. This is costing Under Armour up to $35 million in media exposure, depending on how far the team makes it, according to Apex Marketing. Under Armour has already missed out on $12 million in media exposure through the Elite Eight. Related Link: March Madness Fuels Restaurant Business Across US, Stocks And ETFs In Sector Could Get A Bounce Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO): One of the Corporate Champion sponsors for the NCAA March Madness Tournament is Coca-Cola. The company is using the tournament to launch a new advertising campaign for a brand it owns, Powerade, the official sports drink for the tournament. Called “POWER in Numbers,” the ad campaign celebrates all athletes. In a move similar to what Coca-Cola did by offering names on bottles of its signature carbonated sodas, Powerade is offering bottles with numbers 0 to 99 to coincide with jersey numbers for athletes. AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T): Corporate Champion sponsor AT&T Inc. could see a strong return from the NCAA March Madness Tournament. The company owns Turner Sports, which has aired several of the games throughout the tournament. Turner Sports also works with CBS and NCAA in the streaming of games through the NCAA.com website. Viewers have likely seen AT&T commercials offering the same deals to both existing and new customers. This could lead to some new accounts for AT&T and also possibly keep existing customers from making a switch to other deals.

2021-04-13,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp., Walmart Inc., Apple Inc. and hundreds of other companies are asking President Joe Biden to update the U.S. pledge under the Paris climate accord to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50%, arguing that the future of the economy is at stake if climate change isn’t adequately addressed.The letter to Biden was signed by 310 companies and comes as the administration prepares a new target to show the rest of the world that the U.S. is serious about confronting climate change after four years of inaction by Donald Trump. People familiar with the deliberations said last week that the White House was considering a target of 50% or higher reductions by 2030 relative to 2005 levels.QuickTake: Why the World Awaits Biden’s Pledge on Climate ChangeThe U.S. is on its way to satisfying a target set under former President Barack Obama, who vowed to reduce planet-warming emissions from 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 as part of the Paris climate pact. Signatories to the 2015 Paris pact are scheduled to reconvene in November in Scotland and pledge reductions through 2030.But the businesses, which also included McDonald’s Corp. and the Coca-Cola Company, argue that cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 is attainable.“To restore the standing of the U.S. as a global leader, we need to address the climate crisis at the pace and scale it demands,” the companies added. “A bold 2030 target is needed to catalyze a zero-emissions future, spur a robust economic recovery, create millions of well-paying jobs, and allow the U.S. to ‘build back better’ from the pandemic.”The Biden administration is expected to unveil its new climate target before an international climate summit it is convening in Washington later this month. An aggressive target, part of a White House push to encourage worldwide action to keep average global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial levels, would require broad action to clamp down on planet-warming pollution from power plants, automobiles, oil wells and agriculture.“If you raise the bar on our national ambition, we will raise our own ambition to move the U.S. forward on this journey,” the companies said in the letter. “While an effective national climate strategy will require all of us, you alone can set the course by swiftly establishing a bold U.S. 2030 target.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Biden Hears 310 Companies Urge Speed on Climate: ‘Raise the Bar’

2021-04-16,"We got another new record high in the S&P 500 as stocks continue to march higher ahead of earnings season. Now, let’s look at a few top stock trades going into next week. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Boeing (BA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Shocker: Boeing (NYSE:BA) has more negative news about its 737 MAX jet, which is causing some selling pressure in the stock. As a result, shares are breaking below the 61.8% retracement, as well as last week’s low. If Boeing loses the $245 level, it could create some selling pressure down toward the 10-week and 50-day moving averages, around $237 to $240.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Below that, and $232 is on the table, followed by the 100-day moving average. 10 Stocks to Buy for Your $5K Robinhood Portfolio On the upside, though, a two-times weekly-up rotation would negate all of this bearish talk — propelling BA stock over the last two weeks worth of highs and the 100-week moving average. Above that, and Boeing stock can really take off. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Morgan Stanley (MS) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is moving lower after the company reported earnings, as it struggles to hold above short-term support. Despite beating on earnings and revenue estimates, Morgan Stanley is breaking below the 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 10-week moving averages. It’s also trading down to last week’s low. If it gives us a two-times weekly-down rotation, it could put sub-$75 in play down to the 21-week and 100-day moving averages. On the upside, however, a move back above $80 alleviates some of the selling pressure. But over $82 puts the highs back in play. While I like the financial stocks, I’m cautious with Morgan Stanley until it can prove otherwise. Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Walmart (WMT) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is a name I’ll be watching closely next week. Last week, we got a weekly-up rotation, as well as a monthly-up rotation, as Walmart cleared both the prior week’s high and the March high. This week, shares nearly challenged the prior week’s high, but backed off those levels as it came into the 21-week moving and downtrend resistance (blue line). It’s also giving us an inside week, as this week’s range is entirely contained within the prior week. So, what am I getting at here? Next week — and preferably, early next week — I’d love to see a rotation over $141.12 that builds momentum, as shares go two-times weekly up over the 21-week moving average. That could pave the way for a move to $144.50 (gap fill), followed by $148, then $150-plus. 7 Pet Stocks That Make Good Long-Term Holdings If that setup comes to fruition, some traders may consider using this week’s low as their stop-loss. Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Alcoa (AA) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is trading nicely after earnings, hitting new 52-week highs in the process. Now over $35, let’s see if shares can rally to the 200-month moving average, then the 261.8% extension near $40. On the downside, though, keep it simple. Look for the 10-week moving average to continue acting as support. Below the 200-week moving average and $26 is on the table. Top Trades for Monday No. 5: Coca-Cola (KO) Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will report earnings on Monday before the open. The stock has been very responsive between its 50% and 78.6% retracements. From here, I would love to see a multi-week rotation higher, sending KO stock to the 78.6% retracement near $55 and preferably above this mark. A weekly close above $55 would open the door to $60, and potentially give Coca-Cola some much-needed momentum. On the flip side, I would be a buyer on a pullback to the 200-week moving average and the 50% retracement, near $48. On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in WMT.

2021-04-19,"(Bloomberg) -- Coca-Cola Co.’s sales beat expectations in the first quarter as the soda maker said it saw early -- though uneven -- signs of recovery in demand, particularly in areas with stronger rates of vaccination against Covid-19.The company also said it plans to sell a portion of the Coca-Cola Beverages Africa bottling business via an initial public offering.Coke’s organic revenue, which excludes the impact of currency or acquisitions, climbed 6% in the quarter ended April 2, according to a statement Monday. That topped the estimated 0.5% growth analysts had been expecting, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.The results hint at a potential rebound as consumers worldwide emerge from more than a year of isolation, a process that is happening at different rates in different countries. The company is “encouraged by improvements in our business, especially in markets where vaccine availability is increasing and economies are opening up,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said in the statement.The soda business is unlikely to see full recovery until people are back at restaurants and amusement parks worldwide, buying overpriced hot dogs and giant-sized soft drinks. The uneven reopening pace is showing up in the results: Recovery remains “asynchronous” around the world, the company said. Unit case volume was down 6% in North America, but up 9% in Asia Pacific. Globally, case unit volume was flat.Coke shares rose 1% to $54.20 at 9:52 a.m. in New York. The stock declined 2.1% this year through Friday.Bottling IPOThe company also announced plans to list Coca-Cola Beverages Africa as a publicly traded company within the next 18 months. “A standalone listing for CCBA will enable the bottler to build on its growth trajectory and access capital independently to meet the investment needs of the business, which is great for stakeholders across Africa,” said Jacques Vermeulen, CEO of CCBA.An IPO of Coke’s stake could value the African business at about $6 billion, Bloomberg News reported last month. The soft-drink giant, which owns 66.5% of the bottling company, didn’t specify how much of its stake it intends to sell.Earlier: Coca-Cola Is Said to Consider Options for $6 Billion Africa UnitCoke is grappling with the commodity inflation pressures that are affecting other manufacturers, Chief Financial Officer John Murphy said in an interview.While consumer prices may start to rise this quarter, the company is “well-hedged” to withstand much of the cost pressure in the near term, he said. “We think it’s manageable this year; it’s really a 2022 challenge.”Aluminum CostsMost relevant to the soda maker will be higher costs in plastic and aluminum, including can-supply challenges in the U.S., he said. That should abate in 2022, though, with more supply becoming available.Coke is also seeing increases in high-fructose corn syrup and coffee. The company plans to manage those higher costs with supply-chain productivity and pricing, Murphy said.“Pricing decisions and hedging decisions are actually local decisions,” he said. “We will be working closely with our bottling partners all around the world to come up with the optimal solutions that could happen starting in the second quarter.”Coke reaffirmed its forecast for organic sales percentage growth of high single digits in 2021 and comparable earnings-per-share expansion of high single digits to low double digits. The company slightly trimmed its expectations for the impact of currency benefits on net revenue and comparable earnings.(Updates with share trading in sixth paragraph, adds chart.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Coca-Cola Tops Sales Expectations Amid Vaccine-Led Reopening

2021-04-19,"Coca-Cola’s sales rebounded in the first three months of the year as accelerating Covid-19 vaccinations and a rollback in restrictions on restaurants and bars renewed demand for its fizzy drinks.  James Quincey, chief executive, said he was particularly encouraged by the company’s performance in markets where vaccine availability was increasing and economies were reopening.

2021-04-19,"Coca-Cola’s (KO) business took a real beating last year. This is hardly surprising, as much of the fizzy drink giant’s sales are on-premise: at public places where customers buy drinks to quench their thirst immediately. With vaccines more readily available and consumers out and about in various parts across the globe, Coca-Cola is likely to benefit. However, with the company set to report 1Q21 results today (Monday, April 19) before the open, J.P. Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira thinks that while there’s “increasing visibility to an eventual recovery of KO’s business,” given varying lockdown conditions remain across some of the company’s globe-spanning markets, the full recovery might be “more of a H221 event.” In Coca-Cola’s last business update, the company said that through early February, global volumes had been “tracking down -MSD% (mid-single digit).” Teixeira believes that since then, trends have likely improved in many regions. “We think March and April-to-date trends will show sequential improvement, which we believe is what most investors will focus on and it should give increased confidence in KO's back-half-weighted FY21 outlook of +HSD top-line and +HSD-LDD EPS growth,” the analyst noted. Teixeira expects the bulk of attention is still likely to be focused on “how the company is lapping the early COVID-19 impacts” and how widespread vaccine distribution will affect the business’s recovery. Although the analyst anticipates investors will also be keen to find out how the company performed in the quarter compared to peers and its impact on the company’s plans for the rest of the year. As for the numbers, Teixeira forecasts Q121 organic revenue decline of -3.0% while the Street has organic revenue decline of -0.6%. The analyst’s Q1 EPS forecast of $0.50 is in-line with the consensus estimate. “Net,” Teixeira summed up, “With a strong innovation pipeline, organizational structure changes, and broad reopening, we think KO is well positioned to deliver on its HSD top-line and HSD-LDD EPS growth this year, and return to its long-term growth algorithm (+4-6% organic revenue, +7-9% EPS) thereafter.” However, as the company’s tax dispute with the IRS remains “an overhang in the medium term,” and KO’s valuation is largely in-line with the 5-year average, Teixeira stays on the sidelines with a Neutral (i.e., Hold) rating, backed by a $51 price target. The implication for investors? Downside of 5%. (To watch Teixeira’s track record, click here) Overall, the rest of the Street has a more upbeat take; the average price target clocks in at $58.5, suggesting gains of 9% over the coming months. Based on 3 Buys and 2 Holds, KO stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

2021-04-20,"Coca-Cola reported a 5% year-on-year increase in net revenues of $9 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $8.6 billion. The beverage giant reported 1Q non-GAAP EPS of $0.55 that came in ahead of consensus estimates of $0.50. The company acknowledged that, “The path to recovery, however, remains asynchronous around the world.” Coca-Cola’s (KO) Chairman and CEO, James Quincey said, “We remain focused on emerging stronger and executing against our growth accelerators during the recovery phase. We are pleased with the progress we are making. We are encouraged by improvements in our business, especially in markets where vaccine availability is increasing and economies are opening up, and we remain confident in our full year guidance.” The growth in revenues was driven by a 5% rise in concentrate sales while price/mix increased by 1%. The price/mix rise was mainly driven by pricing in Latin America and North America. The first quarter also included five additional days that led to revenues benefiting from a 6-point growth. For FY21, KO anticipates non-GAAP organic revenues to grow in percentage terms in the high-single digits. KO expects non-GAAP EPS to grow in the high single to low double digits range in percentage terms versus $1.95 in FY20. The percentage growth in non-GAAP EPS is anticipated to benefit by 2% to 3% due to exchange rate fluctuations and also by the impact of hedged positions. The company expects to generate non-GAAP free cash flow of $8.5 billion and has forecasted capex of $1.5 billion for FY21. Separately, KO announced plans to list Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) as a separate, publicly-traded company. As a result, KO intends to sell some of its stake in CCBA through an initial public offering (IPO) within the next 18 months. (See Coca-Cola stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the 1Q earnings, Merrill Lynch analyst Bryan Spillane reiterated a Buy and a price target of $56 on the stock (3.7% upside potential). Spillane told investors in a commentary note that he expects comparable net sales to “include about a +3% to +4% currency tailwind” with comparable EPS “expected to include a +5% to +6% currency tailwind” in the second quarter of 2021. Meanwhile, KO scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the analyst community. That’s based on 4 analysts recommending a Buy and 2 analysts suggesting a Hold. The average analyst price target of $58.80 implies 8.9% upside potential to current levels.

2021-04-22,"NEW YORK, April 22, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, The Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company and Unilever have joined the Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) 100+ Accelerator to fund and pilot sustainable innovation in supply chains. Launched in 2018, the 100+ Accelerator is a global incubator program that works to solve supply chain challenges across water stewardship, circular economy, sustainable agriculture and climate action. Over the last two years, the program has accelerated 36 companies in 16 countries. The 100+ Accelerator offers size and scale to passionate entrepreneurs to help bring their solutions to market faster. These startups have raised more than $200 million and are scaling globally to achieve the program’s mission: to accelerate the world’s shift toward sustainable solutions and to do business the right way, not the easy way. “We are absolutely thrilled to have The Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever join us as founding partners in the 100+ Accelerator,” said Tony Milikin, chief procurement, sustainability and circular ventures officer of AB InBev. “Together, we are striving to supercharge adoption of sustainable solutions by funding and accelerating fantastic innovations that will change the world by making all of our businesses more sustainable. Sustainable business is smart business, and we are working to solve huge problems that no one company can handle alone. With our combined global reach, we can accelerate progress towards a more sustainable future.” In addition to funding pilot programs, the 100+ Accelerator provides ‘hands-on’ support to startups by assigning dedicated teams to help test out their new technologies in a large global supply chain. The addition of The Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever will expand this unique approach and will further establish the value proposition of the AB InBev 100+ Accelerator brand and mission. “Sustainability is foundational to how we conduct business and shape our strategies,” said Brian Smith, president and chief operating officer of The Coca-Cola Company. “We are committed to working with partners including innovators to bring more sustainable solutions to market by leveraging our size and scale. We are pleased to be a partner of the 100+ Accelerator.” The 100+ Accelerator’s startup innovations have already created tremendous impact. Examples include: The implementation of green cleaning solutions to reduce water and energy use in brewing operations in ColombiaSolutions delivering traceability and insurance for smallholder farmers in Africa and South AmericaThe collection of more than 1,000 tons of glass waste in BrazilPiloting returnable packaging in the United StatesRecycled electric vehicle batteries that store renewable electricity in ChinaThe ability to upcycle saved grains from the brewing process to produce nutritious foods in the United StatesThe first solar thermal system to be installed at an AB InBev plant “Colgate’s purpose is clear -- we are reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets, and our planet,” said Patricia Verduin, chief technology officer of Colgate. “And we know that we can achieve our purpose faster and more effectively with equally committed partners like AB InBev, Coca-Cola and Unilever. By becoming a founding member of the 100+ Accelerator, we are elevating sustainability, expediting the innovation process and ultimately maximizing our collective impact.” Embedded within the program is also a focus on social challenges, which are inextricably linked to progress on the environment. From its infancy, the 100+ Accelerator has developed global partnerships including One Young World and Female Founders Alliance as well as dozens of local and regional relationships to build a pipeline of diverse founders. Marc Engel, chief supply chain officer of Unilever added, “The 100+ Accelerator allows industries to work together to propel sustainable innovation. Partnerships like these are critical for transforming global supply chains towards a greener future. The program’s social inequality component is also aligned with Unilever’s values; this year, we made commitments to ensure that everyone who directly provides us with goods and services receives a living wage by 2030, we’re increasing our spend with suppliers from underrepresented groups and committed to train 10 million young people. Through the power of our companies combined, I’m excited about the impact that the program will bring. We need to tackle climate change and social inequality to provide a world that is positive and healthy for people and the planet.” The applications for the 3rd cohort of the accelerator will open April 22 - May 31 at www.100accelerator.com.

2021-04-22,"By his own admission, Coca-Cola boss James Quincey is a risk-taker. “If we’re not making mistakes, we’re not trying hard enough,” the London-born executive said when he took over running the soft drinks giant year four years ago. Little more than a year later Quincey’s words had been put into action. Over the summer of 2018, Alison Brittain, the boss of British brewer-turned-hotelier-turned-coffeemaker Whitbread, came under pressure from activist investor Elliott Advisors to sell Costa Coffee, a business the 250-year-old company had bought for just £19m in 1995. When Quincey offered her £3.9bn for the coffee brand, Brittain could hardly believe her luck. The generous offer raised eyebrows across the City, but Quincey was adamant. “Hot beverages is one of the few remaining segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand. Costa gives us access to this market,” he said. The pandemic has been disastrous for coffee shops. Although able to swerve restrictions on the high street and stay open for much of the crisis, the likes of Costa, Starbucks and Caffe Nero have been hit by first industry contraction for 20 years. Sales have fallen to levels last seen in 2013. Mintel, the market research firm, expects UK coffee sales will reach only £3bn this year. However, these estimates were made in November, before Britain was hit by a third wave of the virus. Store figures suggest that the full extent of the crisis is yet to be felt, with Rishi Sunak’s job retention scheme delaying, rather than negating, job losses. The total number of branded coffee shops decreased by only 182 to 9,159, a fall of just 1.9pc, according to Allegra, a management consultancy.",£3.9bn Costa deal leaves a bitter taste for Coca-Cola

2021-05-17,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. conducted an investigation into co-founder Bill Gates’s involvement with an employee almost two decades ago after it was informed in 2019 of his attempt to start a romantic relationship with that person.The board reviewed the matter and held a “thorough investigation” with the help of an external law firm, the software giant said. It didn’t reach a conclusion to the probe because Gates had stepped down before it was completed, Microsoft said.“Microsoft received a concern in the latter half of 2019 that Bill Gates sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,” Microsoft said in a statement. “A committee of the Board reviewed the concern, aided by an outside law firm, to conduct a thorough investigation. Throughout the investigation, Microsoft provided extensive support to the employee who raised the concern.”Dow Jones earlier reported that Microsoft’s directors found Gates’ involvement with the female employee to be inappropriate and decided last year that he had to step down from the board, citing people familiar with the matter who weren’t identified.Microsoft didn’t provide further details on the investigation.The billionaire said in March last year that he was stepping down from the board to devote more time to philanthropy. Gates hasn’t been active in a day-to-day role since 2008, Microsoft said at that time. Gates co-founded the software company in 1975 and served as its CEO until 2000, the same year his foundation was started, and was chairman until February 2014.‘An Affair’A spokeswoman for Gates said his decision to leave the board has nothing to do with the romantic involvement with an employee.“There was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably,” she said, adding that his “decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter.”The belated investigation into the affair came at a time that was marked by a groundswell of discussion at Microsoft about the treatment of women and Me-Too conversations in the broader industry. Since 2000, Microsoft had also put in place processes for investigating allegations and overhauled them with the goal of making them stronger, the company said.Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich resigned after the board was informed that he had had a consensual relationship with a subordinate, even though that relationship had ended years before and predated his appointment to the top job at the company. The board conducted investigations internally and via external counsel to confirm the violation of the company’s policies and made the announcement June 2018.Gates and Melinda French Gates announced their divorce earlier this month after 27 years of marriage. Several reports, including those that emerged over the weekend, said she had raised concerns over his dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The New York Times had reported in 2019 that Gates had met with Epstein several times, and once stayed late at his New York townhouse. Epstein had died in jail two months prior while awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking.Gates’s spokeswoman denied the reports. The “characterization of his meetings with Epstein and others about philanthropy is inaccurate,” she said. “The rumors and speculation surrounding Gates’ divorce are becoming increasingly absurd.”While Gates’ dealings with Epstein weren’t a part of the scope of the Microsoft investigation, it was discussed by some board members, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.Stock TransfersThe split also put a spotlight on the Gates fortune, valued at about $144 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as well as their foundation.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest of its kind on the planet. With more than 1,600 employees and offices around the world, it has already distributed more than $50 billion since its inception to causes like vaccine development and women’s empowerment.Last week, Cascade Investment, the investment company created by Gates, transferred stock in Deere & Co. to his wife, bringing the total amount she’s received since they announced their divorce to more than $3 billion.The investment vehicle transferred about 2.25 million shares worth about $851 million, according to a regulatory filing. That followed similar disclosures tied to Mexican companies Coca-Cola Femsa and Grupo Televisa and about $1.8 billion of stock in Canadian National Railway Co. and AutoNation Inc.Read More: Gates Divorce Roils World’s Biggest Family Philanthropy EngineMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Microsoft Conducted Probe on Gates’s Involvement With Employee
