Investment strategists at S&P Dow Jones Indices note that stocks with long histories of dividend growth can be an investor&apos;s best friend amid market volatility and rising interest rates. &quot;Dividend growth stocks tend to be of higher quality than those of the broader market in terms of earnings quality,&quot; write S&P strategists Tianyin Cheng and Vinit Srivastava. &quot;Quite simply, when a company is reliably able to boost its dividend for years or even decades, this may suggest it has a certain amount of financial strength and discipline.&quot; And don&apos;t forget: steady dividend hikes not only make a stock more alluring to new income investors, but also reward existing investors with increasingly higher yields on shares purchased at lower prices in the past.  The Dividend Aristocrats are companies in the Standard & Poor&apos;s 500-stock index that have hiked their payouts every year for at least 25 consecutive years.

2019-01-07,"AbbVie (NASDAQ:ABBV) is basically a one-trick pony. The trick is an immunosuppressant called Humira, prescribed to fight rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions. It's the best-selling drug in the world, bringing in $18.4 billion in 2017, but that might not be sufficient to support the future of AbbVie stock.

While protected against direct competition in the U.S. until 2023, Humira is already facing biosimilars in Europe, as its protections there disappear.

AbbVie has been milking Humira for dividends, $4.28 per year, a yield of 4.76%. The stock looks cheap, at 18 times earnings, and has held up well during the bear market, down just 8.7% over the last six months while the average NASDAQ stock is down nearly 15%.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The question for investors is whether AbbVie stock is the kind of defensive play you want to be making in 2019.

  * 9 A-Rated Safety Stocks for a Grossly Oversold Market 



### AbbVie Stock Shows Signs of Life

Like an aging doyenne who can still dance at the ball, AbbVie's situation still looks good.

Despite a price tag of up to $2,600 per month, Humira continues to sell because it has been approved to treat many diseases. Not just arthritis, but Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis and even the heartbreak of psoriasis are treated with it.

While its U.S. patent expired in 2016, AbbVie has been able to extend its U.S. rights into the next decade through ancillary patents and aggressive lawyering. Rather than ending, its sales are expected to just trend down slowly.

While Europe this year will have biosimilars from privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim, Sandoz, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Samsung Bioepis, Humira's revenues won't be destroyed, only reduced.

AbbVie, which was spun out of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013, has also been building its own drug pipeline, with  new dermatology drugs on the way, as well as anti-cancer drugs. It has a treatment for Hepatitis C, Mavyret, which competes directly with Harvoni from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD).

### The Long Look at AbbVie Stock

Still, like that old doyenne, AbbVie knows the sunset for Humira is coming. It's like an old oil field. You can frack it, but those wells, too, won't produce forever.

Early in the next decade, AbbVie will be facing a problem similar to the one Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) did early in this decade, when the rights on Lipitor expired in 2011. There are a host of strategies for keeping such drugs alive, in a financial sense, and AbbVie is engaging in, or preparing to engage, in all of them.

But Humira is as dominant as Lipitor once was, with twice the sales of the next largest-selling drug, Celgene's (NASDAQ:CELG) Revlimid, a cancer drug. AbbVie will need several hits to replace Humira, and time is running out.

AbbVie is the big winner in immunosuppressants, originally developed to prevent rejection of new organs but now offered against a host of autoimmune conditions, but as its own experience with Mavyret shows, European regulators and American pharmacy benefit managers have ways to fight back against skyrocketing prices.

The effectiveness of these tools, pitting drug against drug and choosing a formulary based at least partly on price, is going to increase with competition over the coming years and may be a bigger overhang on AbbVie's growth than its patent expiration.

### The Bottom Line on AbbVie Stock

For now, the good times roll on. AbbVie is due to report earnings Jan. 25, expecting sales of $8.36 billion for a 2018 total of $32.8 billion , 16% ahead of 2017's $28.2 billion. Net income of $1.92 per share will bring that total to $6.92 per share for the year.

But, as they say of both athletes and great beauties, Father Time is undefeated. AbbVie still faces a patent cliff, and growing opposition to rising prices. Nothing lasts forever. What works this year may not work next year. Know that before you buy AbbVie stock.

2019-01-07,"Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX) has been around since 1992 and went public in 2003, though it still isn't exactly on the tip of investors' tongues. But that's already starting to change.

In the past year, the stock was up more than 50% at one point, but then got hit with the market woes as well as the fact that one of its drugs in the pipeline for Tourette's syndrome didn't get the results it had hoped to achieve.

As with most biotech and pharma firms, a setback on a drug can set back the stock as well. And while NBIX has a market cap of more than $6 billion and has development agreements with major pharma companies, it's going to get hit harder than bigger stocks simply because it has fewer drugs in the pipeline than other companies. The setback on one drug could make it harder to keep its burn rate -- the amount of money the company is spending on developing and testing its drugs -- manageable.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

This news and the secular downturn has certainly laid NBIX stock low -- it's off 33% in the past three months and 9% for the past year. At this point, it's a C-rated stock in my Portfolio Grader … but it's one worth watching.

### Why You Should Watch NBIX Stock

When a stock hits a C rating, it could be because it's falling apart and trying to stay competitive and relevant. Or, it could be it's been oversold in a tough market and has what it takes to make it back, but it may take a while.

For NBIX, the latter is closer to the truth.

  * 10 Top Stock Picks From the Street's Best Analysts 



Its TS study was bad news for its current drug Ingrezza, but Ingrezza is already doing better than expected in its current category. And the fact that Neurocrine simply pulled the drug from further TS studies shows that it's not too proud to move that money along to other projects that have more promise.

Plus, its pipeline has other promising drugs in it and interested partners. The company's focus on neurology and endocrinology drugs makes it attractive because it's a niche that few are in. And its success in these sectors also makes it an attractive partner.

Most of its drugs on the market have competitors, NBIX generally has competitive advantages, either in pricing or in dosing. And being able to get these drugs to market with a strong partner like AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) -- partners on Orilissa, a drug for uterine fibroids -- means that it can leave the heavy lifting on the marketing side to a powerful, experienced partner.

When you have big partners, it means you can negotiate better deals with pharmacy benefit management companies and you all get to access their field reps so you get your drug into the hands of more doctors.

But this market is still jumpy, so stock news is also dictated by market and sector news at this point. This is a long-term pick because it has drugs ready to roll out for the next couple of years and collectively they could spell big opportunities.

There's also the possibility that a big pharma may want to snap up NBIX stock to add to its portfolio. It's worth keeping an eye on.

Consumers and investors tend to focus on companies that produce new gadgets or bring the next wave of tech innovation. Many &quot;boring&quot; consumer stocks that have less of a tech focus, however, offer an impressive track record with dividends. This serves as an advantage over a tech industry, which tends to lag the S&P 500 when it comes to offering dividend stocks.

Due in large part to dividends and a loyal customer base, consumer stocks tend to offer stability lacking in some of these more exciting stocks. Also, contrary to popular belief, many of these companies have become innovation leaders.

Although the press may not always report it, these firms often pioneer new products that place them on the cutting edge in their industries.

  * 10 A-Rated Stocks to Buy That The Smart Money Is Piling Into 



The following three companies lead this innovation. They also offer growth rates, valuations and dividend yields that should draw the attention of stock buyers.

Source: Shutterstock 

### AbbVie (ABBV)

Admittedly, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has made a few of my stock lists. I had hoped not to write about ABBV for that reason. However, when an equity offers an almost single-digit forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, double-digit profit growth and the third-highest dividend yield among dividend aristocrats, I cannot leave it off in good conscience.

ABBV stock trades a perfect storm for buyers. The patent on Humira faces patent expirations across the world. This has inspired a wave of selling in AbbVie. Despite this, analysts believe the company's drug pipeline will keep profits growing at double-digit rates. This has led to a forward PE ratio that stands at about 10.1.

This perfect storm also applies to the firm's payouts. Due to its previous history as part of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), ABBV holds dividend aristocrat status. When a stock hikes its payout for 46 years as AbbVie has, the stock price depends heavily on keeping this streak alive.

Even better, ABBV has not made not offered a token hike in the payout merely to maintain the dividend aristocrat status. AbbVie went further, taking the payout from $2.56 per share in 2017 to $3.59 per share in 2018 to $4.28 per share this year. Approving such hikes when they face intense pressure to raise the payout every year shows a strong belief in its own future.

Considering the low P/E ratio, the profit levels, and the dividend growth amounts, ABBV becomes one of the more obvious choices among consumer stocks.

### Altria Group (MO)

Few consumer stocks reflect resilience better than Altria (NYSE:MO). This year will mark 55 years since the U.S. Surgeon General released their report warning on the dangers of smoking. Amid anti-smoking campaigns, increasing tobacco taxes, and multi-billion dollar legal settlements, MO stock should have sunk into obscurity. Instead, Altria has become an unlikely success story.

Despite the hostile environment for tobacco, the company continues to find opportunity. Currently, it invests in both smokeless tobacco and alcohol. It currently holds a 10.2% stake in Anheuser Busch-InBev (NYSE:BUD), for example. Also, despite legal barriers, it has also turned to the emerging marijuana sector. In late 2018, Altria purchased a 45% stake in Cronos (NASDAQ:CRON) for $1.8 billion.

Even with the hostile business environment, MO stock manages to maintain a generous dividend. The current dividend of $3.20 per share yields almost 6.6%. Although MO does not hold dividend aristocrat status, the payout has increased in most years.

As a result, MO stock has long remained a dividend powerhouse. Those who bought the equity in 2000 and reinvested the dividends receive their original investment back every year in dividends alone. The same holds true for those who bought in 1985 and spent or invested the payouts elsewhere.

The company also looks attractive from a valuation and growth perspective. The forward P/E stands at 11.3. Moreover, analysts predict a 7.5% profit growth rate this year. Also, they expect those profit increases to remain in the high-single-digits for years to come. With its successes in related business, and its ability to maintain growth despite strong anti-tobacco sentiment, Altria should continue to stand out among consumer stocks.

### General Mills (GIS)

Despite producing recession-proof products, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and its direct peers have endured years of struggle. An increasing interest in fresh and organic foods has diminished demand for the packaged foods General Mills has produced. As a result, it has seen both revenue and profits steadily fall over the last few years. This has taken GIS stock to levels first seen in 2012.

However, a turnaround could occur soon. General Mills has begun to pivot to reflect consumer tastes. The company owns brands such as Cascadian Farm, Larabar, and Muir Glen that produce certified organic foods.

Such products have helped revenues and profits turns around. After years of falling numbers, analysts predict a 5.5% increase in profits next year. Revenues have already begun to improve as Wall Street expects a 7.7% increase in sales growth for this year.

Also, due to the years of decline, GIS stock trades at 12.7 forward earnings. Although this would not impress investors in a shrinking business, it begins to appear reasonable with growth returning. Also, with a five-year average P/E of 20.6, investors will likely enjoy a nice gain by waiting for the multiple to return to its long-term average.

Even better for income-oriented investors, the $1.96 per share dividend yields around 4.75%. Since they have achieved a 15-year streak of dividend increases, another payout hike will likely come this year.

Both consumers and investors have waited a long time for packaged food companies to embrace more natural foods. General Mills has finally made that move. With its attractive valuations and dividend yields, GIS stock should find a place among the more attractive high-dividend consumer stocks.

As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

During its 37th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Brokers Conference presentation, AbbVie (ABBV) projected its net revenue for 2018 to be $32.7 billion, YoY operational growth of 15%. The company reported a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 11.7% in revenue from 2013 to 2018. According to the company’s third-quarter earnings conference call, it expects a favorable revenue impact of lower than 1% due to foreign currency fluctuations in 2018.

### AbbVie (ABBV)

AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) recapped its many achievements since becoming a public company in 2013. In that time, the company followed through on its mission to create an innovation-driven, patient-focused biotech company. Its revenue growth, which accelerated last year, is proof of its outstanding execution of delivering on new medicines.

2018 Achievements and Outlook: AbbVie expects to deliver on strong growth again this year. Even with biosimilars bringing more competition to its more than $6 billion HUMIRA business, it will ramp up its HCV business in 2018 and will make big investments this year to support new product launches. Imbruvica and Venclexta are two leading mechanisms in the biosimilars that will drive AbbVie's future growth. These investments, or operating costs as seen on the income statement, will pay off as it supports growth over the next decade.

Growth Products: AbbVie's hematology and oncology franchise is already annualizing over $4 billion and is growing in the double-digit rates. Upadacitinib and risankizumab, if approved, will come to market later this year and add to revenue. Management affirmed its confidence in the business by authorizing a $5 billion share buyback. Investors interested in ABBV stock should note the upcoming $1.07 dividend. The stock trades ex-dividend on Jan. 14.

### Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) is trending near 52-week highs for good reason. Its atopic dermatitis drug, Dupixent, has a strong prescription growth rate. Patients, despite the costs, are staying with the medication. Eyelea is another source of revenue. And Regeneron is now developing CAR-T therapies.

CAR-T Science: Regeneron is effectively disconnecting the CAR-T cell from the CD28 system. In doing so, it will allow its scientists to mix and match them. By having combinatorial specificity, it is possible to get better targeting and higher efficacy for treatments. In the non-small cell lung cancer space, where Keytruda failed, Regeneron hopes its agent is at least as effective as Merck's (NYSE:MRK).

  * 10 A-Rated Stocks the Smart Money Is Piling Into 



Core Drivers: Regeneron's core revenue drivers continue to give investors confidence. As mentioned, Dupixent is working out very well for patients. In its last quarter, the drug's global sales were $260 million, or nearly $1 billion annualized. The drug will also treat asthma. Plus, the company has positive data in eosinophilic asthma for reductions in the exacerbations for pulmonary function tests. Given the market size for patients suffering from asthma, Regeneron's revenues are likely to grow at a faster pace than the market expects.

### Amgen (AMGN)

Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) highlighted its double-digit earnings per share growth targets at the JPMorgan conference. It will get there by improving its operating margin from 38% to 52%-54%. Saving $1.5 billion will give it the room it needs to raise its return on capital to its shareholders while continuing on its transformation.

Growth Drivers: Amgen will launch nine new products in two therapeutic areas. It already increased its global presence from 50 countries (in 2011) to over 100 at the end of last year. Its high R&D investments include those in the genetics space. In particular, deCODE Genetics in Iceland is impressive because it has 1 million people outside of Iceland who are part of the effort. It also ended the year with 500,000 patients in the U.S. who are available to study genotypically and phenotypically.

Products: Amgen has six cancer medicines that are in the early stages of product development. Drugs in this space make $4 billion in revenues for Amgen and grew in the double-digit rates in the last twelve months. Looking ahead, Amgen expects to have a strong portfolio of first-in-class molecules. With biospecifics, small molecules, large molecules, its BiTE platform and CAR-Ts, Amgen has the potential to exceed its own growth goals.

As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

However, these companies all benefit from the same trends. The share of healthcare in the overall U.S. economy continues to grow. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that healthcare encompasses about 17.9% of the U.S. economy. Moreover, with an estimated 10,000 baby boomers aging into Medicare a day, the pressure on limited healthcare resources continues to mount.

  * 7 Oversold Small-Cap Stocks With Massive Profit Growth 



While this can mean pain for the healthcare consumer, it can also bring benefit to those who invest in healthcare. With more of the baby boom generation on Medicare, a larger percentage of the population benefits from a healthcare subsidy. This gives a noticeable boost to healthcare stocks. Here are three that could help you benefit from this trend.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### AbbVie (ABBV)

Source: Shutterstock 

Few healthcare stocks find themselves in a better position for both income and growth potential than AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) created AbbVie when it spun off its pharmaceutical division in 2013. After a growth spurt in 2017, ABBV fell as concerns about patent expirations on its blockbuster drug Humira weighed on the stock. Today it trades at about 30% below its 52-week high.

However, ABBV stock also looks well-positioned to make a comeback. The Humira-driven swoon in ABBV has taken the forward P/E ratio to around 9.8. This comes in well below the average P/E of 18.2 over the last five years. Moreover, Evaluate Pharma ranks AbbVie's drug pipeline as second-best in the industry for value creation. Also, the company has time to transition to its next high-revenue drug. It will hold a patent on Humira in the U.S. until at least 2022. Analysts also do not seem worried as they predict profit growth of almost 10% per year through at least 2021.

Furthermore, Wall Street considers AbbVie a dividend aristocrat due to its previous ties to Abbott. As a result, the company faces tremendous pressure to increase its dividend annually. AbbVie increased its payout from $3.59 per share to $4.28 per share this year. Hence, despite a generous yield of almost 4.9%, investors can probably expect annual increases in future years.

Also, I see this massive dividend increase as a vote of confidence in itself. Couple that with the low P/E and the high ratings that AbbVie's drug pipeline has received, and ABBV should be one of the few healthcare stocks which will outperform in both the growth and income categories.

### Teladoc Health (TDOC)

Source:  MayApps207 via WikiMedia 

Buying Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) amounts to buying into the future of healthcare. Without a doubt, the 17.9% of the economy that healthcare now consumes weighs heavily on family budgets. Teladoc allows patients to see a licensed doctor at any time via a PC or mobile device, reducing the need to take time off from work. It also saves money as visits can run as low as $40.

Telehealth has only begun to realize its potential. Analysts estimate telehealth can handle about one-third of the 1.25 billion office visits that take place each year in the U.S. With Teladoc handling an estimated two million visits in 2018, the company still covers less than 1% of its potential market.

Teladoc also shows that it can acquire the right partners to improve its quality and reach more patients. It widened its competitive moat by investing in diagnostic capabilities with a takeover of Best Doctors. It also partnered with CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) to provide care to its customers. Additionally, it boosted its offshore footprint by buying Advance Medical. Advance Medical was the leading telehealth provider outside the U.S. before TDOC purchased the company.

Investors should note that TDOC remains expensive. Its price in the $55 per share range places it at around 9.3 times sales. Still, it has fallen almost 40% from its October high. Also, revenue grew by 78% in 2018. Although that growth will fall over time, analysts estimate that the company will turn profitable in 2021.

  * 10 Growth Stocks With the Future Written All Over Them 



Teladoc remains one of the more speculative healthcare stocks. However, with a $3.8 billion market cap, and a majority market share in a business that has reached less than one percent of its full potential, Teladoc could become one of the best stocks in healthcare.

### Dentsply Sirona  (XRAY)

Source: Shutterstock 

An aging population creates an increasing need for dental care and the equipment provided by Dentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY). As the ticker implies, Dentsply manufactures dental imaging equipment as well as consumable supplies and specialty dental products.

Medicare rarely covers dental needs. However, many consumers place a high value on having a beautiful smile and the ability to chew food. Hence, most customers will spend money on services requiring XRAY's supplies and equipment. This also holds true outside of the U.S. Dentsply Sirona conducts business in over 120 countries. These other countries account for about 65% of the company's revenue.

XRAY stock rose steadily between 2009 and 2018. However, in 2018, the stock lost almost half of its value. By late October, it traded as low as $33.93 per share, a level first seen in 2011. The stock sold off for most of the year on lower-than-expected sales. An impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter hurt earnings. The stock fell by nearly 20% on August 7 following this announcement.

However, management responded with a restructuring plan. While that breeds uncertainty, the forecasts indicate an opportunity for buyers. The forward P/E ratio stands at around 18, well below the five-year average of 28.1. Furthermore, analysts predict 11.2% consensus profit growth this year. They also foresee double-digit profit increases through at least 2021.

XRAY faced a great deal of pain in 2018. Still, the need for dental supplies and equipment will only rise in the coming years. For this reason, the lower multiple and the predicted profit growth should bring about a recovery in Dentsply Sirona.

The coming year could look quite different, however.

Yes, growth has led for a couple years now, but 2019 might well be the year value stocks take back the lead. While a full-blown bear market has faded as a fear, we do appear to be in the latter stages of an economic expansion phase. That is when growth-oriented companies begin to lose their luster and the value of underappreciated stocks starts to shine through. Qualities such as reliability and consistent income can start to matter in a big way when growth stories are threatened. This all has led some experts to predict a comeback for bargains in the year ahead.

Here are the 10 best value stocks to buy for 2019 ... and potentially for many more years to come.

2019-01-30,"Shares of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) have been hammered lately following a disappointing earnings report and slowing European sales of their bestselling drug, Humira. ABBV stock is now trading at the lowest levels since September of 2017 after falling another 4% yesterday.

Certainly some of the selling was warranted due to slowing growth concerns and tepid guidance. But it has now gotten overdone given the fundamental and technical backdrop. Look for ABBV stock to find support and grind higher from current levels.

Earnings were released Friday with the company reporting $1.90 in EPS and $8.31 billion in revenue for Q4. Both of these were just shy of consensus estimates of $1.93 in EPS and $8.36 billion in revenues. The company also guided slightly lower for full year 2019 with expectations now of $8.65 to $8.75 per share falling mostly below analysts estimates for $8.74 per share. Sales of Humira, the company's blockbuster arthritis drug, also was a drag. Overseas sales are expected to be down 30%, but sales in the U.S. are still protected from competition until 2023.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

While both earnings and revenues were just a slight miss, ABBV stock is down 10% over the past 2 days on the news. This makes the forward P/E less than 9. Important to remember that the company did still maintain solid guidance of $8.70 in earnings for 2019, so ABBV stock is definitely looking more attractive on a valuation basis.

ABBV stock is getting extremely oversold from a technical perspective. MACD is now at readings that has marked significant lows in the past. AbbVie is trading at a huge discount to the 20 day moving average, another indication that the selling has gotten to an extreme. This combination of extremes in MACD to the downside and large discounts to the 20-day moving average has coincided with major buying opportunities in the past.

AbbVie stock now sports a very attractive dividend yield of 5.5% and a payout ratio of just 54.5%. This should help serve to buffer any additional downside damage from current levels.

  * 10 Stocks to Sell in February 



Implied volatility remains high in ABBV options due to the recent sharp sell off. This means option prices are still comparatively expensive, so selling a covered call makes sense. Selling the January 2020 $80 call at $6.50 cushions the downside by 8.4% while still leaving some upside price appreciation. Buying ABBV stock around $77 and selling the call around $6.50 puts the net cost at $70.50.

The catalyst for the ongoing rise is the good feelings related to the dovish tilt by the Federal Reserve in recent weeks, with chairman Jerome Powell changing his tune on both the likely path of rate hikes this year and the ongoing drawdown of balance sheet assets.

The rally has pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 16% from the low set in late December, with the index now closing in on its 200-day moving average -- a level that proved to be difficult resistance throughout the end of 2018. If a breakthrough is going to happen, it depends on whether the market follows the strength or the weakness of the following six stocks:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

### Hot Stocks: Apple (AAPL)

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are extending their recent breakout above their 50-day moving average, capping a 20% one off of its early January low thanks to good earnings results and budding excitement over the iPhone refresh coming later this year (with rumors of a three-camera setup). There is also a sense the company has regained some momentum with the well received iPad Pro as well.

The company will next report results on April 30 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.38 per share on revenues of $57.6 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 29, earnings of $4.18 per share beat estimates by a penny on a 4.5% decline in revenues.

### Hot Stocks: Boeing (BA)

Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares are pushing above their October high to break free into clean air, ending a sideways consolidation that started in late 2017, as the demand for new airlines seems insatiable amid bloated order books and increased travel activity. The company's recently reported earnings were a blowout, and more is expected as production ramps up.

Analysts at Canaccord Genuity raised their price target to $380 on what they see as little risk to management's forward guidance. The company will next report results on April 24 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $4.25 per share on revenues of $25.2 billion.

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of $5.48 beat estimates by 93 cents on a 14.4% rise in revenues.

### Hot Stocks: Microsoft (MSFT)

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares are revving up, cutting back above both their 50-day and 200-day moving average as the company adopts a position as the quiet, more professional member of the mega-cap tech stock cohort with its steady focus on corporate cloud business and its no-drama, spotlight-averse CEO Satya Nadella.

The company will next report results on April 25 after the close. Analysts are looking for earnings of $1 per share on revenuers of $29.9 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 30, earnings of $1.10 beat estimates by a penny on a 12.3% rise in revenues.

### Cold Stocks: Allergan (AGN)

Allergan (NYSE:AGN) shares are cratering, down another 4.2% on Monday to cap a loss of more than 14% from the highs set just two weeks ago. Investors are getting cold feet after the company reported a drop in revenue as competitor Evolus (EOLS) received FDA approval for a Botox alternative to be used to reduce wrinkles and fine lines in patients.

The company will next report results on April 29 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $3.57 per share on revenues of $3.5 billion.

  * 7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up Earnings 



When the company last reported on Jan. 29, earnings of $4.29 beat estimates by 14 cents on a 5.7% decline in revenues.

### Cold Stocks: AbbVie (ABBV)

AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) shares are threatening to fall below their early November low, capping a decline of 17% from the highs reached in early December. A breakdown would set up a fall back to levels not seen since the summer of 2017 and deepen an already painful decline of 35% from its 2018 high. Investors have lost interest amid middling results and bio similar competition for Humira.

The company will next report results on April 26 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.05 per share on revenues of $7.8 billion. When the company last reported on Jan. 25, earnings of $1.90 per share missed estimates by three cents on a 7.3% rise in revenues.

### Cold Stocks: DowDuPont (DWDP)

Shares of DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP) are falling to test critical support from a five-month consolidation range after bonking once again on resistance near the $60-a-share threshold. Results have been pressured by weakening demand from China as well as fears over rising recession risks here at home.

The company will next report results on May 2 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of 90 cents per share on revenues of $20.2 billion.

  * 7 Stocks With Too Much Riding On China 



When the company last reported on Jan. 31, earnings of 88 cents per share beat estimates by a penny on a 0.2% rise in revenues.

2019-02-05,"Although many biotech stocks have been hit hard at the start of 2019 while the general market has rallied, this underperformance in the biotechnology space has presented at least two key benefits for investors looking to invest in the area.

First, and perhaps the most obvious, is that being able to enter biotech stocks at a cheaper price -- assuming the companies are not fundamentally broken -- is much better than going in while the stocks are overpriced or in &quot;rally mode&quot;. Second, in situations like this, companies' dividend yields go up.

What all of this means is that despite the seemingly grim picture for biotech, there are actually several solid biotech dividend stocks to invest in now. The struggle is sifting through all the names and finding which of them are the best dividend stocks to invest in.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

  * 10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio 



But don't worry, I've done the hard work for you. Below are three of the best biotech dividend stocks to buy now.

Source: Shutterstock 

### AbbVie (ABBV)

AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 21X, while shares yield 5.45%.

Although short-term investors might be concerned that ABBV shares have been on a downtrend since topping in May 2018 at $122, there is still plenty of longer-term potential in ABBV to be hyped about.

Much of the downside ABBV experienced occurred after its latest earnings report. AbbVie reported fourth-quarter adjusted profits that grew a solid 28% over last year; at $1.90 a share, the company achieved its guidance for the quarter. But the stock gave up around $10 a share, falling from $88 to around $78, after the report. Investors fretted over the 15% drop in international Humira sales. Biosimilar competition in Europe, which makes up 75% of its international Humira business, was expected.

However, generic competition for its flagship drug does not concern ABBV management. It's likely that they're banking on a slew of new product releases in 2019 to offset the aggressive discounting from competitors.

In fact, AbbVie is funding five major products for launch indications this year. This should drive revenue higher and lead to double-digit earnings-per-share growth for the company. All of which makes it one of the notable biotech dividend stocks to buy.

### Allergan (AGN)

Allergan plc (NYSE:AGN) ended its last rally in October 2018, with AGN shares finally bottoming by the end of last year at around $130. The stock fell again from $160 to a recent price of $144 after reporting Q4 results.

Right now, AGN shares will pay you a modest 2.1% dividend. And if the stock rebounds, the total return will be higher.

The botox specialist reported $4.08 billion in revenue, down 5.7% from last year. Non-GAAP income fell 15.4% to $1.45 billion. Encouragingly, sales of Botox rose 9.4%, while the Juvederm collection, Lo Loestrin and Vraylar all rose in the double digits. Although these products are a smaller part of total revenue, it is enough for management to forecast revenue of $15 billion - $15.3 billion this year.

  * 7 Stocks That Won Super Bowl Sunday 



With management forecasting lighter results for the year, why should investors buy AGN stock for the dividends? The firm has six late-stage clinical programs, plans of one to two new product launches annually and the company has strong margins. It made $5.64 billion in operating cash flow last year. This is more than the $976 million it needs for the dividend.

### Sanofi (SNY)

After settling at around $42 at the start of 2019, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) rallied steadily to close at around $43.45 recently. Now, at its 50-day simple moving average, shares have a dividend yield of 4.28%.

Sanofi's underperformance is unusual. Other than trading at a slightly higher valuation at a P/E of 22X, the company did not report any negative news. If anything, the collaborations that this biotech firm has with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) should bolster investor confidence. Regeneron's Dupixent is becoming a blockbuster hit for treating Atopic Dermatitis. Alongside its efforts with REGN, SNY is also supplying the active ingredient of avanafil to Vivus (NASDAQ:VVUS).

Another promising aspect bolstering the case for SNY stock is that on Jan. 23, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Sanofi's Fluzone in young children.

When it reports earnings on Feb. 7, the company should not bring up any negative surprises. It should be consistent like Q3's report where the company reported sales growing 6.3% (at constant exchange rates). Its Bioverativ acquisition should continue to contribute meaningfully to sales.

Looking ahead, an EMA decision in the first half of this year for its oncology drug Libtayo, plus an FDA action date of Feb. 6 for Cablivi, which treats a rare blood disorder, should keep investor confidence high.

As of this writing, Chris Lau held shares of ABBV.

2019-02-11,"High-growth stocks draw the lion's share of the attention in financial media. These securities usually show higher levels of volatility and often represent the future of the American economy. Today, these equities often revolve around new technologies like AI, VR and the Internet of Things (IoT).However, concepts that we might consider &quot;new again&quot; also draw this interest. Due to decades of suppression, cannabis has become one of these areas. Also, judging by the performance of Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), even equities revolving around fast food can turn into high-growth stocks with the right approach.  * 10 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for the Next 10 Months As one might expect, the overwhelming majority of these stocks carry the high P/E ratio that goes along with elevated growth. However, not all prospective buyers want that level of risk. Fortunately, a few high-growth stocks also fall into the &quot;undervalued stocks&quot; category. The following equities constitute some of the best stocks for combining growth with value:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Shutterstock  AbbVie (ABBV)Drug equities don't often make lists of high-growth stocks. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) formed in 2013 when it split from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). It constitutes what was once Abbott's pharma division.ABBV stock has suffered in recent months as its old blockbuster drug, Humira, faces patent expirations in many countries. However, AbbVie's drug pipeline has received favorable reviews. For this reason, most analysts believe that a new drug or a combination of future best sellers will more than replace the income lost from generic versions of Humira.Still, due to the uncertainty, ABBV stock trades at only 8.4 times forward earnings. However, even with a single-digit P/E ratio, Wall Street predicts 10.6% profit growth for 2019. They also believe the average increase will come in at almost 13.4% per year over the next five years.ABBV also offers one key benefit stemming from its former association with Abbott -- dividend aristocrat status. Walking away from its 46-year streak of payout hikes would put ABBV stock at risk. Hence, one can assume the increases will continue. Their board also approved a 40% increase in 2018 and a 19% hike for this year. Given the pressure to raise dividend payments every year, this is a remarkable show of confidence. Moreover, thanks to a lower stock price and higher dividends, the yield now stands at 5.4%.Investing in ABBV stock now involves some faith. However, with a single-digit P/E, double-digit profit growth, and a generous, growing dividend, investors could receive tremendous rewards for believing.Source: Apple  Apple (AAPL)With its $800 billion market cap and massive slide last fall, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might seem like a strange choice for a high-growth stocks list. Indeed, both the stock and the earnings projection saw a considerable move lower as iPhone sales fell well short of initial estimates. Also, laws of mathematics weigh on growth. An increase in AAPL's market cap of just 10% would mean $80 billion in growth, eight times the minimum size of a large-cap stock.However, as smartphone prices fall, Apple is working to make itself less iPhone-dependent. It no longer reports iPhone unit sales. Moreover, moves into services and healthcare should bring new sources of revenue.Due to tepid iPhone sales, profit growth for the year will come in at only 0.3%. But it should reclaim its high-growth status assuming the predicted 11.5% growth (and higher in the years after) comes to pass.  * 7 Bank Stocks to Buy After the BB&T-Suntrust Mega-Merger AAPL stock may suffer for a time as it works to diversify sales away from the iPhone. However, with its enormous cash hoard and its ability to pioneer new technologies, AAPL stock will remain a solid growth story as it works to reclaim its $1 trillion market cap.Source: Shutterstock  CannTrust (CNTTF)I normally would not place an equity with a 51.5 trailing P/E ratio in the &quot;cheap&quot; category, but compared to peers in the cannabis space, CannTrust (OTCMKTS:CNTTF) remains inexpensive. Although one can place almost every marijuana equity in the &quot;high-growth stocks&quot; category right now, CannTrust stands out with its consistent profitability.For those concerned about the OTC listing, CannTrust applied to trade on the NYSE last month. Once that listing occurs, more traders can buy it, so it should see some increase at that time.As most know, the Canadian marijuana boom came to an abrupt end in October when the product gained full legal status in Canada. However, legalization of one form of cannabis, hemp, has reignited this boom south of the Canadian border. The equities of larger peers such as Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) have already recovered most of the losses which occurred following legalization in Canada. CNTTF stock has also risen by more than 60% from its December low.Even if full legal status does not come soon, both hemp and CBD-related products alone should allow for massive growth across the U.S. With its specialty in cannabis oils, CannTrust should benefit. The company also expanded into Europe by becoming the first and only foreign seller of cannabis oil in Denmark beginning in October.At this moment, most cannabis equities could be described as high-growth stocks. However, with its relatively low P/E, its focus on cannabis oil, and the move to the NYSE, CannTrust delivers this growth at a lower risk compared with its key peers.Source: Qualcomm  Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock has suffered in recent years. A long-running legal dispute with Apple has resulted in the exclusion of Qualcomm chips from the later models of the iPhone. This and other legal battles regarding its licensing practices have weighted on QCOM. As a result, the stock trades nearly 40% below a multi-year high last seen in 2014.However, a great deal of anticipation surrounds its 5G-capable Snapdragon 855 chip. Carriers have begun to launch 5G networks, and most expect 5G capable phones to see a wide release beginning later this year. While QCOM's chip will not appear in the iPhone, makers of Android-powered smartphones have shown an interest. As a result, analysts believe that profit increases will again see double-digit increases beginning in 2020. After years of profit declines, Wall Street predicts that annual growth will average 10.7% per year over the next five years. This will occur just as the company's forward P/E ratio falls to around 11.6.QCOM stock has also quietly developed a reputation as a dividend-paying stock. Despite declining profits in past years, Qualcomm has hiked its payout for eight years in a row. As a result of the increases and the lower stock price, the dividend yield has risen to about 4.9%.  * 7 Breakout Stocks In Early 2019 Yes, its dispute with Apple has weighed on the stock. However, thanks to 5G, the company has developed a new source of revenue. Investors can also collect a generous dividend while waiting for 5G to revive QCOM. Thanks to that dividend, QCOM stock should pay off even if it does not pay off in growth.Source: Shutterstock  Spirit (SAVE)Spirit (NYSE:SAVE) has offered value and growth to an industry not known for fostering high-growth stocks: airlines. For decades, Southwest (NYSE:LUV) brought innovation to the industry as its take on air travel brought lower fares, profits, and high-growth to a stagnant, unprofitable industry.Today, Spirit leads that charge. As the leader of the ultra-low-fare segment of the industry, it continues to see massive profit growth and expansion in both domestic and international markets. Spirit has won over price-sensitive customers who will trade perks such as in-flight beverages and carry-on bags for lower costs.Like Southwest, Spirit has depended on one plane type. However, the company now plans to add a type of regional jet to its fleet. This will allow SAVE to bring low fares to smaller markets dominated by legacy carriers.Even without smaller markets, it has already seen growth numbers that shoot toward the stratosphere. Analysts forecast profit growth of 45.7% for 2019. They also believe earnings increases will average above 20% per year for the foreseeable future.Despite this growth, Spirit, like other airlines, has struggled to achieve higher P/E ratios. This may explain why its multiple is only slightly higher than slower-growth airlines such as American (NASDAQ:AAL) or Delta (NYSE:DAL). SAVE's forward P/E currently stands at around 9.6.Admittedly, few gravitate to airlines when looking for cheap, high-growth stocks. However, the massive profit growth and continuous expansion show that Spirit has become the king of the ultra-low-fare airline sector. Driven by small markets and foreign expansion, profits should continue to climb.As of this writing, Will Healy is long ABBV and CNTTF stock. You can follow Will on Twitter at @HealyWriting.

2019-03-06,"A tiny biotech company called Bio-Path Holdings Inc.  became the most heavily traded stock on the Nasdaq on Wednesday afternoon, with shares shooting up 185% after the company announced an update to its Phase 2 trial data on prexigebersen, a potential therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The trial enrolled 17 patients and looked at the safety and efficacy of prexigebersen combined with low-dose cytarabine compared with just low-dose cytarabine alone. Low-dose cytarabine is currently standard of care for patients who can't or do not want to be treated with more intensive chemotherapy. The company said the latest results showed that the rate of patients achieving complete remission (including those with incomplete platelet recovery and those with incomplete hematologic recovery) was 29%. The rate of complete remission for low-dose cytarabine alone is 7-13%, the company said. Bio-Path had already released positive trial results last year, and Wednesday's results were an update to that trial data. The company also noted that 68% of the patients were secondary acute myeloid leukemia patients, a particularly difficult class to treat, something not disclosed previously. Bio-Path added that it saw an opportunity for its drug BP1002 based on the recent FDA approval of venetoclax as a combination treatment for patients with AML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Venetoclax was developed and marketed by AbbVie  and Roche Holding Ltd  subsidiary Genentech. BP1002 targets the same protein as venetoclax but via a different pathway.

2019-03-08,"On paper, pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is off to a solid start this year. So far in 2019, GILD stock is up over 4%. While that's not very impressive, GILD also pays out a 3.9% dividend. So in total, the owners of Gilead stock should receive healthy, double-digit-percentage returns in 2019.Source: Shutterstock Of course, that assumes that Gilead stock will continue to rise. But after examining the situation more closely, that appears to be unlikely. Since early February, GILD has fallen 8%. Moreover, Gilead stock has formed a bearish trend channel since October of last year. Making matters worse, the GILD bulls seemingly have no argument that can stop the decline of GILD stock.  * 5 Airline Stocks In Serious Trouble As if stakeholders needed any more bad news, the company's fourth-quarter earnings per share came in below expectations. Against analysts' consensus earnings per share estimate of $1.74, GILD meekly delivered $1.44. Conspicuously, its Q4 EPS dropped 19% year-over-year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe revenue picture wasn't that much better for GILD stock. Sure, the company beat out the consensus estimate, which called for $5.52 billion,  with a $5.8 billion haul. Unfortunately, the sales beat was overshadowed by the fact that the company's revenue fell nearly 3% versus the year-ago quarter.Most painful of all were product sales, which also slipped 3% YoY, to $5.68 billion. In particular, the revenue of Gilead's hepatitis C drugs tumbled 51% YoY to $738 million.Pouring salt on a festering wound, the company's hepatitis B treatments fell by double-digit-percentage levels, declining to $797 million. Unsurprisingly, Gilead stock tumbled after the earnings report.But what's truly worrisome about GILD is that after more than a month,Gilead stock still hasn't recovered. With Gilead's new CEO, Daniel O'Day, at the helm, should investors hold onto GILD stock, or sell their shares? GILD Stock Has Priced in the Bad NewsI don't blame shareholders for feeling jittery. Although O'Day has a strong, relevant track record given his time at Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY), he's in an unenviable situation. To prevent further damage to Gilead stock, the new leader must address the fallout from the large decline of the company's hepatitis C revenue, as well as diversify his company's product lineup.This is much easier said than done. A key reason why the markets punished GILD stock was that the company was essentially too successful. To put it bluntly, pharmaceuticals have almost no incentive to cure diseases. Instead, managing them and making victims of the disease continuously obtain the drugs will guarantee recurring income.Gilead took a radically-different approach. Rather than manage hepatitis C, its Sovaldi drug cured the disease. That seemed like a bad business move, considering that rival AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has a similar drug. The key difference between the treatments is that AbbVie's offering is ineffective, but profitable.Indeed, when you look at Gilead's Q4 results, you can't help but second-guess its management. Nevertheless, I don't think giving up on GILD stock is necessarily the right answer.Although the company has steep challenges ahead, I'm encouraged by the relatively modest volatility of GILD stock. Since Q4, Gilead stock is down 8%. That's a significant decline, but it's not devastating, particularly because  GILD's  key money maker appears to have weakened so much.Moreover, I find it interesting that GILD stock is staying above its long-term support line that extends back to 2013. Again, if Gilead has really incurred anything close to a fatal blow, it's not showing up in the charts.Secondly, the Q4 report demonstrated that the company has the potential to turn things around. The revenue of its HIV treatments -- including Biktarvy which demonstrates strong potential -- grew meaningfully, gaining 21% to $4.1 billion. Also, its immunotherapy cancer drug, Yescarta, raked in $264 million in 2018. The Long-term Outlook of Gilead Stock Is PositiveIf you look at the GILD stock price over the last five years, and compare it to the progression of the company's top line, you'll notice that they generally align with each other. After absorbing some tough spills, Gilead has generated meaningful momentum with its new-drug pipeline. Eventually, Gilead's share price will likely rebound as wellMore importantly, I think that management's decision to find effective cures for diseases was correct. Although Gilead stock is taking some hits due to the loss of revenue from its hepatitis C treatment, the drug proved that Gilead's science actually works. In the long run, that's an invaluable (and exclusive) brand message that GILD can exploit.And what about AbbVie's hepatitis C drug that manages the illness? ABBV may have outperformed GILD in the past, but today, it's in a worse situation. So far this year, ABBV is down more than 12%.In other words, within the broader healthcare industry, the science eventually matters. While GILD stock isn't perfect, I have confidence that this proven company can work out its pipeline issues. The same can't be said for the competitors that merely tow the line.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-19,"Today, I'd like to discuss the outlook for AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), the $116-billion-market-cap biopharmaceutical stock, whose shares have been in a downtrend for almost a year and have especially been hammered following its earning report of Jan. 25.Source: Shutterstock   * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them There could be further price volatility and weakness in the ABBV stock price in the coming weeks, pushing it toward the low-$70's or even mid-$60's level. However, it is a company with robust growth prospects and respectable dividends that may deserve a place in a diversified portfolio.Therefore, if you already own AbbVie shares, you might want to hold your position. That said, within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 5-7% below the current price point. Expect nearer-term trading to be choppy at best.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIf you are an experienced investor in the options market, you may want to protect your portfolio with a covered call or possibly a put option spread with a 3-month time horizon. If you do not yet hold ABBV, you may want to wait several weeks to buy into the stock at the next dip.With all of that in mind, here's a deeper look into at AbbVie stock. A Hiccup in the Robust Fundamental StoryIn 2013, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) spun off its research-based pharmaceuticals business, creating AbbVie, an independent biopharmaceutical company. Abbott decided to retain the branded generic pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical devices and nutrition.Meanwhile, AbbVie took control of the development and commercialization of a range of brands, including Humira, its flagship drug used to treat autoimmune diseases, Imbruvica, which differentiates between cancer cells and regular cells, and Synthroid, a replacement for a hormone normally produced by the thyroid gland.The company's financials and growth metrics over the past five years have been impressive and ABBV was in a strong financial position heading into 2019, with hopes of a higher share price during the first quarter.However, in January, AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings release weighed heavily on the stock. For starters, the company missed the consensus on revenue. Its earnings per share of $1.90 was below the expected number of $1.94. The next day, the stock fell by 6% and that decline has intensified over the past two months.ABBV's quarterly report also showed that the international sales of Humira fell by almost 15% year over year, mostly as a result of 'biosimilar' competition in Europe, which makes up three-quarters of the overseas Humira business. In October 2018, its patent in the European Union (E.U) expired.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refers to biosimilars as &quot;highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product … [that has] no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness.&quot; Although Wall Street had already known about this sales decline in Europe, when coupled with the other question marks in the earnings report, it was enough to increase the selling pressure on the stock.It is also possible that investors got worried about the potential fall in Humira revenue when the drug comes off patent in 2023 in the U.S. It is important to emphasize that AbbVie's revenue from the drug will not decline to nothing when the biosimilars hit the market in 2023. What will most likely happen is that as the company's pricing power decreases, the revenue will also gradually decline.Therefore, many analysts feel that ABBV shares offer value and that any bad news that is specific to Humira is already baked into the stock price. Value PlayWhen markets penalize biopharma stocks, it can take some time for them to recover.  However, for patient long-term investors, the returns can be significant -- especially when the company boasts several other current drugs, as well promising ones in the pipeline.At present, AbbVie's other major products include:  * AndroGel, a testosterone replacement therapy.  * Creon, a pancreatic enzyme therapy to treat exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  * Duopa and Duodopa, gels to treat Parkinson's disease.  * Viekira Pak, which treats chronic hepatitis C.  * Zinbryta, to treat multiple sclerosis.Analysts are also expecting a slew of new products in 2020, such as next-generation immunology drugs.  These drugs and others that are being developed and commercialized, highlight how impressive the potential growth story could be in the next few years.ABBV trades at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.  This number is rather modest when compared with the P/E ratios of  several competitors, including AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) with a P/E of 49.9, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) with a P/E of 25.2, and Merck (NYSE:MRK) with a P/E of 34.8. Reinvesting the Sweet Dividend Yield of ABBV stockIncome investors know that they can compound their returns through reinvesting dividends from high-yielding shares. AbbVie also offers investors a healthy dividend yield of about 5.4%, another reason why I believe the stock belongs in a capital-growth portfolio.Since its spin-off from Abbott Laboratories in 2013, ABBV has increased dividends every year -- a trend that is likely to continue. The next dividend payment is scheduled for May 15, 2019, with an ex-dividend date of April 12.It would not be wrong to call AbbVie a cashflow machine; as of Dec. 31, the company had a free cash flow of $3.27 billion. This strength not only gives shareholders conviction that the dividends are safe, but also provides the company with enough flexibility to, for example, make acquisitions to offset any further Humira revenue decline (especially in the U.S. when the drug comes off patent in 2023). The Bottom Line on AbbVie StockLike most biopharma stocks, AbbVie is a high-momentum stock. In other words, when the broader markets go up or when the company's earnings beat expectations, both investors and momentum traders tend to hit the &quot;buy&quot; button fast, expecting superior gains within days or weeks.However, if markets suffer a decline or if the company cannot keep up with the rising expectations, investors' risk appetite decreases fast and these stocks can fall much harder than less volatile stocks.  * 7 Financial Stocks to Invest In Today The market has punished Abbvie stock since the start of the year. The stock may continue to struggle through much of 2019. However, patient ABBV bulls will probably be proven right to believe in the management's commitment to create shareholder value and to further grow the company both organically and through acquisitions. In the meantime, they can continue to collect high dividends.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-03-21,"AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock continues to slide, despite a buoyant market. The shares are down 12.3% year-to-date and 28.5% over the past 12 months. That's a dreadful performance in comparison to either the Nasdaq Composite index's 5.22% increase or the 11.8% gain by VanEck Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF (NASDAQ:PPH) from year-ago levels. ABBV stock makes up 5% of the pharma industry exchange-traded fund's current portfolio.Losses continued following AbbVie's latest quarterly report. In it, we saw 2019 guidance fail to excite investors. Several drugs underperformed expectations. However, many investors see the continued weakness in AbbVie stock as an opportunity. The now-5.31% dividend yield in particular has generated much enthusiasm. In this market, that sort of yield is amazing. That is, assuming it comes from a safe source. Should you trust ABBV stock here? AbbVie Stock ConsReplacing Humira: Investors are asking where AbbVie goes after Humira? As of Q4 2018, Humira made up 61% of the company's revenues. Yes, that is down from 65% for the same quarter in 2017, but the company's transition to other products simply isn't happening fast enough to inspire much confidence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHumira generates about $20 billion in annual sales at the moment and 2018 was another record year for the franchise. However, cracks are showing. International sales -- now getting hit by generics competition -- fell by double digits in 2018. While that was more than offset by a continued rise in U.S. sales, the plaque psoriasis drug should lose American patent protection in 2023. At that point, AbbVie could lose the biggest share of its revenue if other pipeline drugs don't come along fast enough.  * Top 7 Service Sector Stocks That Will Pay You to Own Them Political Pressures: The intro of the Trump Administration's proposed 2020 budget has drug prices back in the news. The budget takes aim at drug pricing with a variety of measures. Perhaps most relevant to AbbVie, the budget would sharply cut reimbursements for prescription drugs once a generic hits the market. Given the reliance here on Humira, that's a major concern.Meanwhile, the presidential election cycle is kicking off again. Remember that pharma and biotech stocks got clobbered ahead of the 2016 election as investors considered negative comments from both leading candidates. The Trump administration is going after drug prices, and several of the Democratic candidates seem inclined to do the same. Expect more negative political headlines in coming months.Dividend Cut Coming? Most analyses of AbbVie's dividend safety seem focused almost exclusively on 2019. Yes, the drug maker can afford the ABBV stock 5.5% dividend yield for the time being. In fact, there is plenty of room to spare, based on its relatively low dividend payout ratio.However, so much of the shareholder base here is like that of Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) in 2015. That is to say, investors were attracted to past rising profits and oblivious to future threats. Just as Gilead's profits plummeted once HCV revenue started dropping, AbbVie will face a far more-complicated situation in a few years. People buying AbbVie for its past dividend history are driving while looking out the rearview mirror. AbbVie Stock ProsThat Dividend Yield: Just as any bearish argument involving ABBV stock starts with Humira's patent problems, bulls invariably point to the dividend yield. And with good reason. At this point, ABBV stock is offering investors a choice yield of 5.31%. You'll find only a handful of other $100-billion market cap companies that pay as much.On top of that, AbbVie continues to increase its dividend. In the past year, it upped its quarterly payout from 96 cents to $1.07. Sure, there is good reason to doubt that the dividend hikes will continue once Humira goes off patent. But for income investors that are willing to play the timing game, there should be a few good years of income potential here as Humira enjoys its waning years of windfall sales numbers.  * 5 Cloud Stocks to Help Your Portfolio Fly New And Rising Drugs: AbbVie has a lot of newly launching or still-growing drugs moving to replace Humira. Analysts have suggested that AbbVie could hit $7 billion peak sales with Imbruvica, and reach the $1-2 billion range for each of three others, Venclexta, Orlissa, and Mayvret. Meanwhile, while Risankizumab and Upadacitinib are still a distance from commercial success, both are potentially $5 billion drugs if all goes according to plan.Add it all up, and you could match Humira's current $20 billion annual sales contribution with this assortment of newer drugs. It would take a lot to go right -- and in pharma, things usually don't all follow plan -- but there is a path here. It's also worth remembering that Humira sales won't go straight to zero even as the generics arrive; there will be several more years of reasonably strong cash flows first.AbbVie still has a respectable pipeline and some time to keep developing other options even as Humira's U.S. patent cliff steadily approaches.Discounted Stock: Despite a hot stock market, ABBV shares have been caught in a downdraft. With the stock market up 15% for the year, AbbVie's 13% decline stands in a rather stark contrast.Given the decline, the stock is now trading at under 9x forward earnings. I don't think P/E multiples are a great metric for pharma companies due to patent issues. But plenty of other investors do. The combination of a low P/E ratio and a stock that has fallen sharply will likely attract numerous dip buyers to help give ABBV stock a bounce. AbbVie Stock VerdictThe clock is ticking. In 2023, Humira's U.S. sales are likely to start to plunge as generic competition arrives. As we've seen internationally, Humira sales started to tank as soon as that happen elsewhere. Will the company's newly launched drugs and pipeline do enough to replace Humira?My guess that it won't be. Humira did $19.9 billion in sales last year. A typical blockbuster drug will hit a few billion a year in sales. AbbVie needs multiple new blockbusters simply to maintain its current revenue stream, let alone grow additionally. It's not impossible, but the odds are long. Unfortunately, $30 billion-plus in debt limits AbbVie's options and makes a dividend cut in coming years quite likely. That will be terrible news for ABBV stock, given its huge dividend income investor base.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned GILD stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2019-04-12,"Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announces earnings on Tuesday before market open. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based healthcare company has become one of the strongest, longest-running brands in existence.Source: Shutterstock However, challenges with drug patent expirations have blunted earnings growth in JNJ stock. This has left JNJ trading in a range for more than two years. Though this report will probably not deliver any meaningful surprises, investors still need signs that earnings growth will resume in Johnson & Johnson stock to break the equity out of its range. Pharma Will Drive the Report on JNJ StockTuesday's announcement will kick off earnings season for the pharma industry. Wall Street forecasts Q1 earnings to come in at $2.06 per share, matching the number for Q1 2018. They also predict revenues of $19.6 billion, a 2% decrease from the $20.01 billion announced in the same quarter last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Consumers know JNJ best for its consumer health products. However, many often forget that medical devices and pharma each drive greater shares of the company's revenue. It is pain in the pharma division that's driving the predicted revenue decline.Sales of Simponi/Simponi Aria and Xarelto fell in the fourth quarter. The company has also cited alternatives to Velcade, Tracleer and Zytiga in explaining revenue declines. By no means is JNJ stock the only pharma stock to struggle with new competition. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) faces the same issue with Humira. Also, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) will see its patent protection go away in its blockbuster drug Lyrica this summer.Patent expirations have long affected pharma stocks, and this may have helped to trap JNJ stock in a range. Since early 2017, JNJ stock has traded near the $120 per share to $150 per share range. Now, its forward P/E ratio comes in below 15. In the past few years, JNJ's forward P/E has typically been in the high teens to the low 20s.The stagnant earnings may explain the modest discount in JNJ stock. For this reason, I think investors will focus on guidance in the upcoming report. As of now, Wall Street expects 2019 earnings to increase by 4.6%. In all likelihood, investors will need to at least see that figure to move JNJ higher. JNJ Stock Retains Numerous AdvantagesFortunately, some tailwinds could help JNJ stock. Traders should remember that JNJ stock usually beats estimates, at least on earnings. For that reason, I would expect the earnings number to come in higher than $2.06 per share.Also, JNJ stock should continue to deliver the stability for which the public knows the company. For now, JNJ and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are the only two U.S. companies that maintain a AAA credit rating. Debt levels have fallen over the last year, so I see no change in that status coming.Also, attention should shift back to the dividend in the coming days. The company traditionally announces a hike to its JNJ stock dividend soon after the Q1 report. They have increased the payout every year since 1963. Hence, I do not see the company breaking its 56-year streak of payout increases. The only question remains how much of a dividend hike JNJ gives.Johnson & Johnson stock currently pays 90 cents per share each quarter, a yield of about 2.65%. In the past, earnings growth has had little obvious effect on the size of the increase. While I do not foresee any surprises, the dividend boost could help JNJ stock to recover. Concluding Thoughts on JNJ StockGoing into earnings, investors need to see guidance that will help break JNJ stock out of its range. Johnson & Johnson usually beats earnings. However, patent expirations on key drugs have led to modest declines in revenue. They may also explain why JNJ has traded in a range for the last two years.However, conditions increasingly point to the potential for a rising stock price. The P/E ratio has fallen below company averages. Moreover, analysts forecast earnings increases in later quarters and for the overall year. If company guidance confirms those predictions, JNJ stock should rise. An expected dividend hike in the coming weeks should offer further help.  * 7 AI Stocks to Watch with Strong Long-Term Narratives JNJ stock trades at about $135 per share now. If guidance affirms or exceeds profit growth predictions, I think it could help take JNJ past $150 per share sooner rather than later.As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

2019-04-16,"The market opportunity for cannabis is enormous. According to Grand View Research, the spending is expected to hit a staggering $146.4 billion in the U.S. by the end of 2025.Nowadays there are more publicly traded companies to play this megatrend, including names like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC), Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY). Beyond these stocks' extreme volatility, they also fetch sky-high valuations, with price-to-sales multiples often well over 50x.So, is there way to get exposure to the cannabis opportunity -- but not take on too much risk? Interestingly enough, there is one such stock to consider: AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). It's a company that rarely pops up on many people's radar screen when it comes to cannabis. After all, it's one of the world's largest traditional pharma operators, with roots going back to 1888. Keep in mind that ABBV stock was spun-off from Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSo what does ABBV stock have to do with cannabis? Well, consider that the company has a drug on the market, called Marinol. It is based on a compound known as dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC, which is a natural part of the marijuana plant (that is, cannabis sativa). This is what activates the &quot;high.&quot;  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Now Marinol has proven to be effective in dealing with the symptoms of a host of terrible diseases. For example, it helps deal with the nausea from chemotherapy and the weight problems resulting from those who suffer from AIDS.Granted, Marinol is not a blockbuster drug. But then again, it does show the promise of cannabis as a treatment. More importantly, as for AbbVie stock, the drug is an indication of the company's ability to push innovation with alternative treatments. In other words, it would not be a surprise that it will go on to leverage this experience to look at more treatments.What's more, the use of cannabis for medical purposes is certainly a major opportunity. There are already 41 countries that allow for this, whether on a federal or state level. Bottom Line on AbbVie StockGranted, it would not be a good idea to invest in AbbVie stock just because it has a cannabis drug. To be sure, as seen with the latest earnings report, the company does have some problems as it issued disappointing guidance. Since early this year, ABBV stock has sunk from $91 to $81.The nagging issue is the company's most important drug, Humira (this is for the treatment of arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis). For the most part, the growth is slowing. And yes, there are worries about when the U.S. patent protection comes off in 2023.  * 8 Risky Stocks to Watch as Earnings Season Kicks Off Despite all this, I still think there is a bullish case for AbbVie stock. One, the company has a decent roster of drug candidates that could move the needle -- and help make up for a shortfall in Humira. For example, it has several immunology treatments (risankizumab and upadacitinib) that should hit the markets this year. Interestingly enough, when it comes to the pipeline, AbbVie has lots of potential with the cancer market. To this end, its drug Imbruvica is likely to spin-off various treatments for the category.And who knows, perhaps there could be potential from cannabis as well? I think so.In the meantime, AbbVie stock sports a dirt-cheap valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at only 8.6x. Oh, and the dividend is at 5.15%, making it one of the highest among the major pharma companies.Tom Taulli is the author of High-Profit IPO Strategies, All About Commodities and All About Short Selling.

The direction of the market's undertow, if there is one, remains unclear.Source: Allan Ajifo via Wikimedia (Modified)3M (NYSE:MMM) did more damage than any other name, falling nearly 13% after reporting disappointing first-quarter numbers and ultimately deciding to cull 2000 jobs to adjust for a poor outlook. Nokia (NYSE:NOK) wasn't far behind with more than an 8% stumble though, after swinging to a surprising first-quarter loss.There were some winners, though not as many, and no major names made meaningful gains. New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) jumped more than 5% yesterday on news surrounding its new Marley-branded CBD drink, but NBEV shares gave back more than 2% in yesterday's after-hours trading.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Automation Stocks to Buy for the 21st Century None of them are great trading prospects headed into the final trading day of the week though. Rather, it's the stock charts of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) that have earned closer looks. ConocoPhillips (COP)Back on April 12, ConocoPhillips was put under the trading microscope as a potentially bearish candidate. A major floor was being tested, repeatedly, but more than that COP stock was logging more lower highs thanks to increasing resistance at key moving average lines. Most noteworthy of all was that ConocoPhillips was being left out of a rally most other energy names were enjoying.As of Wednesday, that support line has been snapped. As of Thursday, the bears put some distance between that floor and COP stock.  Click to Enlarge  * The big line in the sand is right at $65, plotted with a red dashed line on both stock charts. Although shares had been lower since that floor was defined, that's the low that has been found the most since the middle of last year.  * Bolstering the bearish tide is the volume behind it. The weekly chart's Chaikin line has already crossed below zero, which tends to be a good signal of a sizeable pullback.  * It's subtle, to the point of being mostly overlooked. But, as of Thursday's action, all four key moving average lines are sloped downward, pointing to the depth of the bearish momentum now in place. MGM Resorts International (MGM)In January, MGM Resorts popped out of a well-defined downtrend. Although the effort continued to get traction for a few more days, that move was ultimately unwound -- and then some -- in February and March.The bulls appear to have regrouped since then, pushing the stock back above all the key moving average lines. It's this second effort, in fact, that largely seals the deal on the bigger rebound effort. The key is the interplay of those moving averages.  * 5 Cheap Energy Stocks to Buy Under $10   Click to Enlarge  * This week's triggering event is the move back above the 200-day moving average line, plotted in white on both stock charts.  * Also, take note of the way the moving average lines are starting to converge again after a big bearish divergence last year. The impending bullish crosses of those moving average lines are buying triggers in and of themselves.  * The clincher for the budding rebound effort would be a break above $27.96, plotted with a red dashed line on the daily chart. That's where MGM has peaked a couple of times since last week.  * Although compelling, the budding renewal of the breakout so far lacks volume. If the volume is still light after any move above $28, close caution remains advised. AbbVie (ABBV)With just a quick glance, AbbVie looks like it's in serious trouble. Shares have been trending steadily lower since April, and are within easy reach of new 52-week lows … again.ABBV stock may be better positioned for a rebound than it seems on the surface, however. While there's still some significant work that needs to be done to snap AbbVie out of its bearish rut, a great deal of the needed hard work has already been done.  Click to Enlarge  * The game-changer here is the horizontal support that has developed around $77 over the course of the past few months. That floor is plotted with a yellow dashed line on both stock charts.  * Curiously, although it has not helped make much forward progress, the past three days have not only been bullish, they've been on above-average volume. The bulls may be testing the waters.  * From here, ABBV will need to hurdle the falling resistance line that tags all the key highs going back to May of last year. That line is plotted in light blue on both stock charts, and currently rests at $85.60.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-01,"If the trend is your friend, off and on the price chart biotech stocks Merck (NYSE:MRK) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) make a great pairing as a sector long and short in MRK stock and ABBV stock. Let me explain.Earnings and its associated volatility can be a tough trade. I've said that before and I'm sure I'll say it again. There are however, times when an earnings confessional and price action go hand-in-hand for good reason. That appears to be the case for biotech stock Merck.  * 7 Stocks That Are Soaring This Earnings Season Then there are times when other worries simply trump whatever a company has to say at the corporate altar. And that's the situation facing ABBV stock in today's market and why it's time to position for a pair of friendly bullish and bearish trends still in motion off and on the price chart.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Biotech Stocks Long: MRK StockAn existing bullish trend in MRK stock just became a good deal friendlier following Tuesday's all-around strong earnings report. By the numbers, the first of our two biotech stocks delivered stronger-than-forecast profits of $1.22 versus the Street's estimate of $1.05.A supportive sales beat on revenues of $10.81 billion was also announced. Strong sales of $2.27 billion in Merck's core Keytruda drug and year-over-year growth of 55% led the way.And that's not all this biotech stock did to please investors either. Merck also backed up the solid quarter by narrowing and raising its full-year profit and sales guidance slightly above the midpoint of consensus estimates.Lastly and rounding out the corporate confessional and making conditions more bullish on the price chart, Tuesday's investor reaction of 2.51% did double duty on the monthly time frame. MRK Stock Monthly Chart  Click to EnlargeOn the monthly price chart, Tuesday's decent reaction by investors is a much bigger deal longer-term. With the gain MRK stock effectively managed to establish an engulfing candlestick resembling a hammer pattern for the month of April. That's potentially very bullish. And with this biotech stock's uptrend intact following a pair of healthy corrective bases over the past couple years, our recommendation is to put Merck shares on the radar for purchase.Specifically, I'm in favor of giving away some potential upside in MRK stock in order to receive additional price confirmation. That said, I'd recommend waiting to buy this biotech stock above the pattern high of $83.85 on the expectation of bullish momentum and profits to follow. Biotech Stocks Short: ABBV StockThe second of our two biotech stocks is AbbVie. And much to the chagrin of ABBV stock bulls, shares are setting up the short side of this pairs trade.Bottom line, despite a terrific sounding earnings report last week, ongoing and escalating concerns about generic competition for its once untouchable Humira drug continues to make investors more than a bit itchy to exit.On the price chart shares of ABBV stock have corrected by roughly 37% since hitting an all-time-high last January. Typically and for a company of AbbVie's size, that would be enough to consider looking at shares as an opportunistic value play. But not this time.With so much of this biotech's success attributed to Humira and those sales now at risk, uncertainty manifesting itself over the past four few months into a tight series of doji candles near key technical lows is concerning. It's also potentially a profitable short position. ABBV Stock Monthly Chart  Click to EnlargeMy recommendation is to short ABBV stock below $76.81. This entry only triggers if April's doji, which failed at angular resistance, is penetrated on the downside.  * 5 Biotech Stocks for a Long-Lived Portfolio After three plus months of narrowing and anxious price action, a short position should turn quickly profitable with shares increasingly at risk of trending towards longer-term support in-between $60 -- $62.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

2019-05-06,"Healthcare stocks have fallen somewhat out of favor, as tech and faster growing industries have lead the rally in equities this year. There is a prevailing notion that healthcare stocks  are defensive, given their business models  and the dividends they pay to their shareholders. However, there are standouts in the sector that are poised to deliver growth, spurred by new approvals and new markets.Source: Shutterstock For those looking for a diversified approach to investing in healthcare stocks, Health Care SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLV) and iShares Dow Jones US Healthcare (NYSEARCA:IYH) are good options that are relatively liquid. The two funds track each other very closely, though there is a slight difference between their yields. XLV yields 1.6%, while IYH has a slightly higher yield of 1.9%.  * 7 Energy Stocks to Buy to Light Up Your Portfolio For investors looking to bet on individual stocks, Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) and AbbVie I(NYSE:ABBV) look like particularly good options. Within the XLV fund, MRK stock makes up 6% of overall holdings and ABBV stock accounts for 3.5% of its assets.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMRK  stock and ABBV stock are primed to bounce back after both dropped slightly recently. Their performance should help offset any potential weakness of the fund's  other  holdings, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).JNJ stock  is by far XLV's largest holding, comprising over 11% of its total assets. Though I have concerns about the legal risks facing JNJ stock, the benefit of owning the index is that its diversification reduces the risk posed by each stock. Healthcare Stocks to Buy: MRKMerck demonstrated its ability to execute on its global strategy in the first quarter, generating double-digit percentage sales and earnings per share growth, no small feat, considering that the market cap of MRK stock is over $200 billion. MRK's investments in research and development are clearly paying off, and the owners of MRK stock should be very positive about the company's 2019 outlook.The company's China business generated a large part of its growth, driven by high sales of its oncology drugs and vaccines there. Excluding the negative impact of currency fluctuations, its China sales soared 67% year-over-year. China is a huge market with significant demand, but it's not an easy nut to crack. Many multinational corporations spanning various industries have struggled to generate profits there. Merck's ability to drive sales in China bodes well for its future growth and for MRK stock.On the oncology front,   the FDA's approval of MRK's Keytruda for a number of indications, including advanced renal cell carcinoma and melanoma with lymph nodes, was a big win for MRK stock. The EU also approved Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy. Sales of Keytruda were up 55% year-over-year in Q1.Expect further approvals of MRK's  oncology drugs throughout the year to provide a boost to MRK stock. A number of the company's animal-health treatments could also be approved. Healthcare Stocks to Buy: ABBVABBV stock hasn't maintained as much upward momentum as I would have expected after it reported very solid Q1 results. This global pharmaceutical company focuses on four therapeutic areas: immunology, oncology, virology and neuroscience. ABBV is a healthcare stock that has a lot of potential, given the strength of the company's pipeline.ABBV's quarterly sales and earnings both beat expectations, leading ABBV to increase its full-year EPS guidance from $7.26 to $7.36. Most importantly, the company's pipeline advanced meaningfully. Notably, the FDAand the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare both approved the company's SKYRIZI treatment, which could improve the standard of care of psoriasis.Those were big wins in a therapeutic area with a great deal of long-term potential. ABBV has multiple other products making their way through the approval process, setting the stage for ABBV stock to benefit from multiple positive catalysts in the near future.In oncology, AbbVie announced a strategic partnership with Teneobio, a biotechnology company that's developing a new class of biologics for the treatment of cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases. The two companies have agreed to develop and commercialize  a biologic calledTNB-383B for the potential treatment of multiple myeloma.ABBV' has several other ongoing collaborations that will expand its oncology research platform, enabling it  to develop life-changing treatments andmeaningfully boost ABBV stock.As of this writing, Luce Emerson did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-05-30,"Thanks to advances in technology and gene sequencing, gene therapy has gone from science fiction to science fact.  By either adding new genes to fight faulty ones, replacing/editing missing/broken prices or actually &quot;turning off&quot; the genes causing problems, gene therapy has the potential to change the game when it comes to biotech stocks and healthcare.That's great news, as there are more than 10,000 different disorders and diseases caused by faulty genes.With the FDA launching several fast-track programs for gene therapies last summer, the biotech stocks that specialize in these cutting-edge treatments could see their drugs hit the market that much faster. And yet, the recent market sell-off has caused many of the biotech stocks looking at gene therapy to crater. Given their game-changing potential, these days many stocks in the sector could be considered bargains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSome more than others.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War Which gene-therapy biotech stocks have great potential to soar over the long haul? Here are three stocks to buy that could do just that. Gene Therapy Stocks to Buy: CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)Source: Shutterstock Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats is a mouthful to say, which is why scientists have shortened it to just CRISPR. CRISPR is the latest method of gene editing and offers cheaper, simpler and faster slicing and dicing of genes. As its name implies, CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) uses the technique.CRSP stock is targeting blood diseases such as beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease- which are caused by the same mutation. The beauty of this is that the biotech has been able to move ahead at the same time for both indications. Partnering with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), CRSP's lead candidate -- CTX001 -- started phase 1 clinical trials this past February. This trial marks the first time in history that a human trial for a CRISPR-based product has been conducted.Naturally, a lot is riding on the trial- especially with the drug winning FDA fast track status. If results are even somewhat positive, CRSP stock could surge higher.But CTX001 isn't the only drug in CRSP's arsenal. The firm is working one several oncology products as well as new gene editing therapies for muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. These drugs could provide plenty of upside as well down the road.In the end, if you're looking for biotech stocks to buy that are looking at gene therapy, CRISPR Therapeutics could be a major star. uniQure NV (QURE)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to biotech stocks, uniQure (NASDAQ:QURE) is gene therapy royalty. That's because the firm actually created and launched the very first successful gene therapy back in 2012. However, due to the cost of the drug, it was never prescribed. But QURE has turned that successful approval into a platform for further successful development.This includes the biotech stock's latest work for hemophilia. QURE has seen great success with its gene therapy program for the blood disorder. After seeing amazing initial results, QURE has moved its top hemophilia medication -- AMT-061 -- into phase I/IIb trials. This news sent the clinical stage biotech stock up more than 34%. Given its past history of navigating the gene therapy waters to approval, QURE could have another hit on its hand.Elsewhere, the firm has started trials for the first gene therapy targeting Huntington's disease and has gene therapies for congestive heart failure in pipelines. All of these are much more &quot;popular&quot; issues and should help QURE actually see prescription growth if successful.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for June Like most clinical-stage biotech stocks, QURE is a gamble. But it's a more calculated risk than most given its history and how great its previous results were. Voyager Therapeutics (VYGR)Source: Shutterstock When it comes to clinical stage biotech stocks, it pays to look at partnerships. For gene therapy play Voyager Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VYGR), partnerships include biotech giant AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), neurological specialist Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX) and major pharma stock Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY). All three of those major players have provided VYGR with some major cash infusions to develop its technology and gene therapy applications. Most clinical biotech stocks would kill to have more than $360 million in cash on their balance sheets.That cash will provide it plenty of working capital to develop its lucrative gene therapy portfolio.And lucrative it will be. VYGR is targeting Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. These are some of the hardest diseases to crack and winners here will be massive achievements. It seems that Voyager may just get there.So far, results for the firm's tech have been pretty positive, which could explain all the major partnerships. Back in March, Voyager announced that its initial trial for VY-AADC demonstrated improvement in clinical measures for Parkinson's Disease. This success prompted VYGR to start phase II trials -- with results coming in mid-2020. Meanwhile, the firm is moving forward with initial trials with its other partners and developing a robust pipeline. With ample cash, VYGR has plenty of time to get these therapies through testing. Fast track designation from the FDA doesn't hurt either.All in all, VYGR represents a great gene therapy play thanks to its leading partners. Clearly, they see the good in the biotech stocksAt the time of writing, Aaron Levitt was long CRSP and VYGR stock More From InvestorPlace  * 4 Top American Penny Pot Stocks (Buy Before June 21)   * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War   * 5 REITs to Buy While They're Dirt Cheap   * The Only 3 Marijuana Stocks You Need to Own Compare Brokers The post 3 Top Gene Therapy Stocks That Could Soar appeared first on InvestorPlace.",3 Top Gene Therapy Stocks That Could Soar

2019-05-30,"Investors have sold stocks on nervousness surrounding the inverted yield curve. No inversion this large has occurred since 2007, right before the 2008 financial crisis. But don't indiscriminately slam that &quot;SELL&quot; button just yet. Yield-curve inversions merely indicate recessions rather than predict them.However, given the length of the economic cycle, cautious investors could take the recent yield-curve inversion as a signal to go into cash or low-cost stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What Is an Inverted Yield Curve?In most cases, longer maturity dates on bonds tend to bring higher interest rates. However, anomalies sometimes occur. One example involves an inverted yield curve. The yield curve inverts when the interest rate on 10-year treasury bonds dips below the same interest rate on three-month bonds.With the trade war in Asia looming, investors have sold stocks and put money into the 10-year treasury as a haven. As a result of increased demand, the interests rates on these bonds have fallen and the U.S. now faces the most significant inversion since 2007. As of this writing, the three-month Treasury yields 2.36%. Meanwhile, the 10-year interest rate has fallen to just above 2.23%. Hence the yield curve has now inverted by almost 13 basis points.  * The Only 3 Marijuana Stocks You Need to Own This worries investors mainly because of the length of the current economic cycle. The current recovery first began in March 2009, making this the eleventh year of the ongoing expansion. Since 1945, economic expansion cycles have lasted for an average of 58.4 months. Hence, the current cycle has now run more than double the length of the average period.That said, investors should see the length of the expansion as a risk factor instead of a sign of a looming recession. Australia has seen 27 straight years of economic expansion. For this reason, we cannot assume the U.S. current growth period will end soon. Investors Can Still Find Stocks to BuyMoreover, even if a recession occurs, investors can still find stocks to buy. This typically happens because some companies operate on different economic cycles. For example, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has faced a looming patent expiration on Humira, a key source of revenue. Consequently, ABBV stock trades at a forward P/E ratio of just 8.25. Moreover, ABBV's dividend yield stands at about 5.4%. What makes the cash return more significant is the fact that AbbVie has built a 46-year track record of annual payout hikes that will likely continue. Even with a recession looming, I cannot recommend selling such a stock in that instance.The same holds true for AT&T (NYSE:T). T stock has suffered as competition in wireless as well as cord cutting hurt profits. Moreover, it had to spend tens of billions of dollars to build a 5G network to remain competitive. However, thanks to 5G, AT&T looks poised to begin an expansion cycle. With or without a recession, customers will make this switch, and this should bolster AT&T stock. Further, the forward P/E stands at 8.8 on a stock with a 34-year history of dividend hikes. Hence, the payout should continue to increase annually despite a 6.6% dividend yield. Concluding Thoughts on the Inverted Yield CurveThe inverted yield curve may or may not signal a coming recession. However, cash and low-cost stocks will serve investors no matter what happens to the economy. The recent yield curve inversion is the most significant since 2007. As a result, stocks sold off as investors feared another economic slowdown. The current economic expansion also causes concern as it has now persisted more than twice as long as the average post-World War II expansion.Still, investors should not panic. For one, Australia has shown that expansion cycles can persist for decades. Further, many stocks have seen recessions of their own in recent years. Consequently, investors can find equities at low P/E ratios, some of which offer growing dividends with high yields.  * 7 Stocks to Sell Amid an Escalating Trade War Investors cannot avoid a recession. However, by remaining nimble and finding stocks coming out of a downturn of their own, investors can still profit.As of this writing, Will Healy is long ABBV stock.

They certainly aren't all built the same.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Here's a run-down of 10 different dividend stocks to buy, from a variety of industries. Investors won't necessarily need all of them to create a more defensive-minded portfolio, though considering more than one might not be a bad idea either. Dividend Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.4%The 1.4% yield on shares of software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock isn't exactly jaw-dropping. But this name is a healthy combination of income of well-shielded growth that could resist marketwide weakness should trouble arise.The key is the ongoing shift in the company's business model. Rather than sell software via a one-time purchase (and hope that customer chooses Microsoft again when it comes time for an upgrade), Microsoft is increasingly looking to &quot;rent&quot; access to wares for a nominal monthly fee. The end result is reliable recurring revenue driven by everything from its Azure cloud-management platform to its office-productivity suites to games played on its Xbox franchise.The company is a bit cryptic when it comes to explaining how much of its business is repeat business, but of last quarter's $30.6 billion in revenue, &quot;commercial cloud&quot; products like Azure, Office 365 and LinkedIn -- which are subscription-based -- generated $9.6 billion in sales. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 5.5%Drugmaker AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has been a tough name to own of late. Shares are down 33% from their early 2018 peak, mostly in response to patent woes. The primary U.S. patent on its Humira -- which accounts for more than half of its sales -- has expired, which threatens a huge chunk of its business.That generic threat (in the U.S. anyway) won't materialize until 2023, however. That's when the recently approved biosimilar Hyrimoz, from Novartis (NYSE:NVS) subsidiary Sandoz will become available.  * 7 Stocks to Buy for the Coming Recession That clearly puts a countdown timer on ABBV stock and its capacity to pay a dividend, and other Humira-related patents are scheduled to expire in the meantime. It's mostly incorrect to say that Humira sales are on the verge of collapse, though. In turn, the company shouldn't have any trouble supporting its current dividend for the foreseeable future.The yield? A very attractive 5.5%. Waste Management (WM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 1.8%When most investors look for dividend stocks to buy, they first and foremost consider utilities, banks and real estate investment trusts, and for good reason. These types of companies are well suited to drive reliable, recurring revenue that's relatively easy to pass along to shareholders.There's an oft-overlooked area, however, that's even more recession-proof than utility companies are. In good times and bad, humans are always going to produce garbage … as in literal trash.Enter Waste Management (NYSE:WM) -- a company that hasn't failed to grow its top line in any quarter since the beginning of 2016, and has never been in any serious dire straits. Income has grown about as consistently, even if never at breakneck speeds.It's anything but sexy, and the present yield of 1.9% isn't exactly thrilling. Given its defensive nature on top of reinvesting the regular income it offers though, WM stock has averaged an annual return of nearly 19% over the course of the past ten years. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.6%The good news is, the trouble crude oil prices and energy stocks were in back in 2014 and 2015 is in the past. The bad news is, crude prices are stabilizing (more or less) at values that allow all energy companies to thrive.It's a scenario that actually plays into the hand that a huge name like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is holding. It has the size and scale smaller players don't, allowing it to acquire opportunities as they arise while simultaneously allowing it safely hunker down when oil prices slide lower.  * 7 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy at Least Yielding 3% Factor in the stock's dividend yield of 4.6%, and what you're left with is a healthy name that's not locked into the broad market's up and downs. Texas Instruments (TXN)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.7%Any name in the semiconductor business can be viewed as a liability in the wrong environment. If there's any worthy exception to that line of thinking, though, it's Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN).Its advantage? It doesn't make the CPUs and GPUs and other high-performance tech that consumer and corporations have to have when times are good, but are shunned when times are bad. Rather, Texas Instruments makes a wide variety of simple and complex technological solutions, many of which you utilize every day without even realizing it, and most of which you've never heard of.That's not to suggest Texas Instruments is bulletproof, because it isn't. Its business still ebbs and flows. Those ebbs and flows aren't sea-sickening though, and the edge is taken off of any big swing by its respectable current yield of 2.7%. Kraft Heinz (KHC)Source: Mike Mozart via FlickrDividend Yield: 5.3%Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) shares are down a stunning 66% for the past year, with most of that rout stemming from accounting issues that delayed the company's full-year filing until just last Friday. The stock's jump in response barely made a dent in the stock's long-term demise.Analysts still aren't exactly impressed either. Though closing the internal probe of accounting concerns and bringing in a new CEO to lead a rebuilding effort is a step in the right direction, Credit Suisse's Robert Moskow still has &quot;concerns about business distractions and the investment we think the company will need to make in management talent, brand-building, and product innovation as it tries to pivot to topline growth.&quot; Stifel's Christopher Growe isn't a fan either.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Could Be Takeover Targets Investors looking for reliable income won't find many better dividend stocks to buy, however. Thanks to its long-term pullback, KHC now yields a solid 5.3%, and is still earning more than enough to pay its dividend.It's also earning enough to finally stop lowering its dividend, which is something of a victory in and of itself. Verizon Communications (VZ)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 4.2%No good list of dividend stocks to buy can afford to not name at least one telecom play. Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) gets the nod this time around, sporting a yield of 4.2%.Wall Street isn't a huge fan, for the record. Its consensus rating is somewhere between a &quot;buy&quot; and a &quot;hold&quot; thanks to a slew of downgrades since the latter part of last year, and the average price target of $59.64 is only about three points better than the stock's present price. The overarching theme from the pros is simply not enough bank for the bucks Verizon is being forced to spend not to get ahead, but just hold its place relative to its competitors.Verizon does have an advantage though. While in retrospect its acquisition of Yahoo (and the melding of it with AOL) was ill-advised, rival AT&T (NYSE:T) finds itself now bogged down by its video entertainment ambitions, while Sprint (NYSE:S) and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) have essentially conceded defeat as standalone entities.In short, Verizon remains the best-of-breed in a business that isn't ever going to go away. Altria Group (MO)Source: Peyri Herrera via Flickr (Modified)Dividend Yield: 6.1%The smoking cessation movement has been gaining traction in the United States for years. Yet, it would be wrong to say Americans are giving up vices. The decline of the cigarette market has of course been offset by vaping and even a growing interest in hookas -- yes, hookas -- as alternative forms of self-indulgence. Meanwhile, the nation is increasingly embracing and legalizing cannabis.Altria Group (NYSE:MO) hasn't overlooked this consumer shift. It now owns a significant piece of marijuana play Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), and though it has actually backed out of the vaping business for the time being, in April the company got the FDA's green light to sell so-called IQOS devices. It's a hybrid of e-cigs and traditional cigarettes.  * The 10 Best Stocks for 2019 -- So Far Altria's dividend is going to remain protected for the foreseeable future, and with its current yield of 6.1% the stock gives income investors a lot to like. U.S. Bancorp (USB)Source: Shutterstock Dividend Yield: 2.8%Large banks have struggled of late, along with their stocks.Most of that weakness has been merited. Aside from the occasional (albeit temporary) inversions of the yield curve that threaten the profitability of lending activities, most of the mega-banks appear to have trouble managing their sheer size when business isn't exactly booming.Not so with smaller, regional banks like U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). By avoiding the more volatile pieces of the banking market like mezzanine loans to shaky corporations or an investment-banking business that has to underwrite wobbly startups, U.S. Bancorp actually finds itself better positioned for lethargic future than many of its peers. Reliability counts.At the bank stock's current price, its dividend yield is a solid 2.8%. Ford Motor (F)Source: FordDividend Yield: 6.1%Finally, add carmaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to your list of dividend stocks to buy if you're looking for reliable income in the near future. Its current yield is an incredible 6.1%.In retrospect, the doubters were technically right. Though predicted years too early, the company did hit the headwind shareholders expected it to. This year's top line is projected to slide a little lower, while next year's should be flat.Nevertheless, Ford never imploded the way the stock's multiyear, 50% drubbing suggested was in the cards. The company's still making a ton of money, and still passing a bunch of it along to investors. Namely, it's earned $1.30 per share last year, but only paid 59 cents worth of dividends. There's more than a little wiggle room.  * 7 Dark Horse Stocks Winning the Race in 2019 Better yet, now that Ford is (finally) regrouping and rethinking the future of mobility, a rekindled wave of demand for its next-generation vehicles could already be brewing.As of this writing, James Brumley held a long position in Ford and AT&T.

AbbVie said it had agreed to revise the CANOVA study protocol, including new risk mitigation measures, protocol-specified guidelines and updated futility criteria. The drugmaker can resume enrolling patients in the CANOVA trial at sites where the protocol has been approved, but all other clinical trials of venetoclax in patients with multiple myeloma are still on hold. The FDA placed a partial hold on all of AbbVie's clinical trials of venetoclax for multiple myeloma in March. The hold came after a review of another Phase 3 trial's data showed there was a higher proportion of deaths in the treatment arm than in the control arm.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- AbbVie Inc.’s $63 billion deal for Allergan Plc will take the company’s debt burden to a level that can rival some junk-rated companies.But both Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings are giving the drugmaker the benefit of the doubt in its ability to quickly slash as much as $18 billion of its borrowings. Moody’s signaled it will leave its rating on AbbVie unchanged at Baa2, or two notches above speculative-grade. And S&P said it’s likely to lower its grade one level to BBB+, a step higher than where Moody’s rates the drugmaker.Credit investors aren’t exactly penalizing companies for taking on such debt, either. While AbbVie’s relative borrowing costs increased in trading Tuesday after the deal announcement, companies rated in the lowest tier of investment-grade are paying some of the lowest premiums ever to borrow. Even those companies that tip into junk territory pay relatively little in extra yield.Why? One clue: investors who’ve bought lower-rated debt are being rewarded with some of the best returns in years.“Companies have been given the green light to use a lot of leverage,” said Travis King, head of investment-grade credit at Voya Investment Management. “Debt is cheap so it makes sense from their perspective, and rating agencies are giving them the OK to do that.”Both Moody’s and S&P estimate that the Allergan transaction will push the company’s debt to at least four times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda). In presentations Tuesday, though, AbbVie said it plans to reduce its debt load by as much as $18 billion by the end of 2021. That should cut leverage to about three times Ebitda within two years of the deal’s closing, the ratings firms said.The assumptions underscore a consistent theme in the corporate bond market over the past decade, in which companies have loaded up on relatively cheap debt for acquisitions. While they often sacrifice pristine credit ratings in the process, stable cash flows and the promise of big savings from the mergers have allowed them to keep their ratings in the BBB tier, the lowest rung of investment-grade. More than half of the $5.6 trillion investment-grade bond market is now rated in that tier.Even so, BBBs have been among the best performing assets in fixed income this year, boasting returns of nearly 11% that have outpaced gains on debt issued by speculative-grade companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors are reaching for higher-yielding assets thanks to the Federal Reserve’s signals that it’s willing to cut interest rates to sustain the economy.“This is the product of a rate environment that will encourage companies to use debt to achieve their strategic goals,” said Scott Kimball, a money manager at BMO Global Asset Management in Miami.Read more: A $1 Trillion Powder Keg Threatens the Corporate Bond MarketInvestors have flagged the potential for a wave of downgrades to junk should the economy worsen, and some say the ratings firms are cutting companies too much slack. Anne Walsh, chief investment officer of fixed income at Guggenheim Partners, said last week that credit raters have baked in too much confidence in BBB companies’ ability to delever even though it’s “not realistic” in a recessionary environment.Plenty of market participants said Tuesday that AbbVie’s debt-cutting plans are entirely plausible.“For better or worse, the ratings agencies must take, in good faith, management’s deleveraging goals as part of these debt-financed mergers, said Mike Holland, a Bloomberg Intelligence credit analyst. “This merger would create a company with substantial free cash flow such that a debt reduction target of $15-$18 billion by the end of 2021 is not unreasonable.”&#92;--With assistance from Natalie Harrison and Katrina Lewis.To contact the reporter on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Shannon D.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- AbbVie Inc.’s 15% drop after announcing a deal to pay $63 billion for Botox maker Allergan Plc may bring on deja vu for some investors who are still feeling the burn from the drugmaker’s last deal blowup.While the purchase would provide a band-aid of sorts for beaten-down AbbVie, investors can’t help but remember how the company’s purchase of Stemcentrx Inc. for $5.8 billion went up in flames. That deal, and its subsequent write off in January after drug-development stumbles, drew criticism from Wall Street analysts and ramped up pressure on management.Fast forward to Tuesday, where AbbVie’s intraday move wiped out as much as $18.4 billion in market value, more than the value ascribed to all but nine companies in the closely-watched Nasdaq Biotech Index. “Financial engineering doesn’t make a more attractive pipeline,” SVB Leerink analyst Geoff Porges wrote in a research note.Other analysts say the Allergan deal looks more like a cosmetic fix than a long-term solution. “Two turkeys don’t make an eagle,” Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said.To contact the reporter on this story: Bailey Lipschultz in New York at blipschultz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Scott SchnipperFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",AbbVie's $18 Billion Blowup Brings Deal Deja Vu to Some Holders

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- AbbVie Inc. agreed to pay $63 billion for rival drugmaker Allergan Plc, the latest merger in an industry where some of the biggest companies have been willing to pay a big premium to resolve questions about their growth prospects.The price tag caused heartburn on Wall Street, and AbbVie had its worst day of trading since it was spun off from former parent Abbott Laboratories. The stock closed down 16% to $65.70 in New York.Allergan shares finished the day up 25% to $162.43. AbbVie will pay $188.24 a share in cash and stock, according to a statement, a 45% premium to Allergan’s closing price on Monday.“Allergan, with its well-known Botox, is being used to smooth the wrinkles this time not of a face but of a company,” said David Maris, an analyst with Wells Fargo. “While this is a good alternative for Allergan versus the current share price, we are not convinced that this is a better long-term alternative for shareholders.”The proposed takeover doesn’t give AbbVie a pipeline full of potential blockbuster drugs, but it buys the company time to develop more. Allergan provides AbbVie with a set of products big enough to diversify its revenue from Humira, the rheumatoid arthritis injection that is the world’s biggest-selling drug worldwide, with about $20 billion in sales last year. Allergan, which is heavily reliant on the wrinkle reducer Botox, will get a profitable exit for shareholders after a four-year slide.While they use cost savings from the deal to shore up profits, the companies will still be under pressure to show investors they can come up with the next big thing. AbbVie may be nearing the limits of how far it can boost Humira’s price as cheaper competitors come to market, a problem Allergan is already grappling with as more alternatives to Botox emerge.The companies have developed several potentially promising medicines for a range of diseases, though so far none have convinced investors that they can attract the vast pool of patients that take medications like Humira.On a conference call announcing the deal, AbbVie Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez, who will lead the combined company, said the transaction should ease concerns about future competition to Humira, adding that the drug is lucrative enough to bankroll the purchase of its eventual successor.“This is a transformation transaction that provides important strategic benefits for both AbbVie and Allergan,” Gonzalez said. “This will have a profound impact on AbbVie’s overall growth story.”Gonzalez said on the call with investors that the transaction “isn’t highly dependent on pipeline.”One drug considered to be a contender to replace some of Humira’s sales over the long term is AbbVie’s Skyrizi, a new psoriasis treatment that many patients may find more convenient than Humira, as it needs to be injected less frequently.“Patients love Skyrizi, it’s a big contender,” said Mark Lebwohl, the Waldman Chair of Dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “It’s four shots a year and appears to be incredibly effective. AbbVie already knows how to sell this drug.”Size ScrutinyThe drop in North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie’s shares Tuesday also reflects investors’ concerns over activist opposition and regulatory scrutiny. Earlier this year, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. faced opposition from some top investors to abandon its $74 billion acquisition of Celgene Corp. The transaction eventually won the backing of a majority of shareholders, but Bristol-Myers shares are still trading well below their pre-deal value.On Monday, Bristol-Myers said that it had agreed to divest one of Celgene’s top products, the psoriasis pill Otezla, in order to appease regulators at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. While there are few major areas of overlap between Allergan and AbbVie, the deal is almost certain to get a careful look from regulators. The company does plan to divest two Allergan drugs, IL-23 and Zenpep, to ensure the deal passes muster, Gonzalez said.Still, AbbVie’s acquisition is evidence that the world’s biggest drugmakers believe bigger is better. Along with Bristol-Myers’s deal for Celgene, Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. earlier this year completed a $62 billion takeover of Shire Plc. A combined AbbVie and Allergan will have sales of about $48 billion, the companies said in a statement, making it one of the biggest in the industry.Back to the U.S.The deal will return Allergan to the U.S., at least for tax purposes. While the company is run from New Jersey, it moved its domicile to Dublin in 2015 via another merger, partly to take advantage of lower corporate rates abroad. The 2017 U.S. tax overhaul cut corporate levies to 21% from 35%, which reduced incentives for companies to relocate overseas.AbbVie currently pays far less in tax than that, however, and has said it will have an effective rate of 9% this year. It has projected its effective rate will rise to 13%.Allergan CEO Brent Saunders had spent months turning over plans for the drugmaker’s future as its stock price dropped from a 2015 peak of almost $340. Those options included selling off the company’s gastrointestinal drugs or women’s health unit, which would have left it more focused on its profitable medical aesthetics line that includes Botox.AbbVie said it expects at least $2 billion in annual pretax synergies and other cost reductions in year three of the deal.Allergan holders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie shares and $120.30 in cash for each share they hold. AbbVie will take on Allergan’s debt, which totaled about $24 billion at the end of the first quarter.Two Allergan directors, including Saunders, will join AbbVie’s board after the purchase is completed, according to the statement. Gonzalez said on the call that he intends to stay with the company at least through Humira’s loss of exclusivity in the U.S.The deal is expected to close in early 2020, the companies said.Morgan Stanley & Co. acted as AbbVie’s financial adviser and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and McCann FitzGerald were legal advisers. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was AbbVie’s financial adviser, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox gave legal advice.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When the maker of the top-selling arthritis drug says it’s buying a leader in anti-wrinkle treatments, you’d be forgiven if your initial response to the news was that it seems like a match made in heaven. But take a closer look, and AbbVie Inc.’s $63 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan Plc isn’t such a perfect fit. AbbVie is desperate for diversification as sales of its $19 billion arthritis blockbuster Humira begin to slow; in Allergan, it has the  opportunity acquire a rival at a relative bargain. Even at a 45% premium to Allergan’s closing share price Monday, AbbVie is paying a fraction of what the drugmaker was worth just a couple of years ago, and Botox is still growing.The deal is projected to net big synergies: AbbVie projects cost savings from the combination will plump up its bottom line by $2 billion within three years. But AbbVie's most significant problem isn't the next few years. It's figuring out how to grow when Humira's sales take a real dive starting in 2023. It’s not clear that Allergan will be much help there, and the early reaction from AbbVie shareholders suggests they have doubts:The long-term outlook for Botox is a matter of debate. The toxin, which is used to both smooth wrinkles and treat migraines, has impressive brand recognition and a solid grip on the market. But a cheaper competitor on the market from Evolus Inc. was recently approved, and another from Revance Inc. has produced compelling data and is on the way.On top of that, there’s a new class of preventative migraine drugs on the market, which could pressure Botox’s market share from a different angle. Botox has held up so far. But these pressures are only going to increase over time, and its best days of growth are likely in the past. There’s a decent chance that its sales will flatten just as Humira’s begin to crater when biosimilar copycats hit the U.S. market in 2023.Then there’s the question of what AbbVie gets outside of Botox from Allergan’s pharmaceutical business. The fit is questionable; AbbVie is principally focused on cancer and drugs for inflammatory conditions like arthritis. Allergan doesn’t add anything significant there. So is the quality. Aging products, questionable deals, and research failures have battered Allergan’s stock to the point where investors have been calling for a breakup of the company or a change in management. Allergan has a few growing marketed products, including gastrointestinal drug Linzess and anti-psychotic treatment Vraylar. But there’s little in its late-stage development pipeline to get excited about, especially given its poor recent track record in R&D. Allergan adds little in the way of the research capability required to discover new medicines, and that’s by design. The company has deliberately focused on acquiring assets that others have developed. AbbVie’s acquisition track record since it separated from Abbott Laboratories in 2013 is shaky. Pharmacyclics Inc. netted it half of a good cancer drug at a bruising price, and its $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx Inc. looks like a complete flop. The company’s biggest deal yet may not improve its reputation.To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2019-06-25,"(Bloomberg) -- AbbVie Inc.’s deal to buy Botox maker Allergan Plc for $63 billion is reviving excitement on Wall Street for makers of specialty and generic drugs, at least for today.For now, investors are shrugging off concerns surrounding the opioid crisis and highly leveraged balance sheets to rush back to drugmakers ranging from flailing Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. to Endo International Plc in the aftermath of AbbVie’s deal as they position for the next multi-billion dollar deal.Shares of drugmakers jumped early Tuesday, led by a 4.7% advance for Endo and a 3.2% gain for Teva. Peers like Mallinckrodt Plc, Mylan NV, Bausch Health Co, Perrigo Co., and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc traded higher as the market saw small losses.The relief rally couldn’t be better timed for an industry that has seen share prices crater to five- to 20-year lows across the board as concerns from opioid liability to sinking generic drug prices and pressures from the White House pushed investors to the exits. But with valuation being the main driver for potential investor interest, Barclays analyst Balaji Prasad advised investors to “resist the temptation” in a note earlier this month.The announcement split Wall Street analysts with Cantor analyst Louise Chen saying the deal brings Perrigo into light as a potential target “given their move toward pureplay consumer and an activist shareholder in the stock.” While Citi’s Andrew Baum disagreed, calling the deal more AbbVie specific “rather than heralding a broader wave of large cap M&A across the sector.”It’s worth noting that the large cap-skewed Nasdaq Biotechnology exchange-traded fund, (IBB), rose 0.9% after the open, while the equal-weighted SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) gained close to 1% in a sign that investors are expecting a further uptick in deal volume for the blossoming biotech sector. Biogen Inc. -- one of the drugmakers that investors now think may fit the profile of a company looking for a rescue -- outperformed, climbing 4%.(Updates share movement in third paragraph, adds analyst commentary in final paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Bailey Lipschultz in New York at blipschultz@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, Scott SchnipperFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",AbbVie’s $63 Billion Allergan Deal Gives Life to Industry

2019-06-26,"(Bloomberg) -- Elliott Management Corp. had built a position in Allergan Plc and was pushing to split the company before AbbVie Inc. agreed to acquire it for $63 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The hedge fund, run by billionaire Paul Singer, supports the AbbVie takeover, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn’t public. Elliott believes the deal is a win for Allergan shareholders and that even if it doesn’t go through, the Botox maker could fall back on its proposed plan to split up, they said.Elliott owns a 2.5% stake in Allergan, according to a regulatory filing. The New York based fund trimmed its position slightly on the news of the takeover, the filing shows.Allergan shares rose 25% Tuesday after the deal was announced. They were up 1.3% to $164.55 at 12:23 p.m. Wednesday in New York in trading, giving the company of a value of almost $54 billion.Representatives for Elliott and Allergan declined to comment.Constructive DiscussionsElliott believes the company was deeply undervalued given the strong growth of its aesthetics business, which makes Botox, other fillers and breast implants, the people said. It had been in constructive discussions with Allergan’s management in recent months, they said.The firm had advocated separating Allergan’s therapeutics business from its aesthetics business and setting up a licensing agreement between the two for Botox, which is used in both businesses, the people said.The plan would have been similar to Ipsen SA’s licensing agreement for the neurotoxin Dysport with Nestle SA’s Galderma unit, they said.Attractive TargetElliott also believes the aesthetics division would be an attractive takeover target for consumer and pharmaceutical companies, they said.The hedge fund had believed the split was the best path for the company prior to the agreement with AbbVie because it would have unlocked a lot of value, was within management’s control, and would have helped reestablish the leadership team’s credibility with investors, they said.(Updates with company's response in fifth paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Cynthia Koons.To contact the reporter on this story: Scott Deveau in New York at sdeveau2@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Liana Baker at lbaker75@bloomberg.net, Matthew Monks, Michael HythaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Elliott Management Advocated for an Allergan Split Prior to Sale

2019-06-26,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- AbbVie Inc.’s  $63 billion purchase of Botox maker Allergan Inc. is the third super-sized drug deal announced in the past 14 months, and the second just this year after Bristol-Myers’s Squibb Co.’s even bigger $74 billion purchase of Celgene Corp. These huge combinations are no fluke: In the last decade, the biopharmaceutical industry has pursued more $40 billion-plus transactions than any other sector, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. These big deals happen for a reason. Drug development is difficult, unpredictable and time consuming; even when the billions pharmaceutical companies spend on R&D or strategic purchases and partnerships bear fruit with top-sellers, those blockbusters still face the prospect of expiring patents and an eventual decline in sales. That pressures drugmakers into bigger acquisitions, in spite of their mixed track record and inherently risky and complicated nature. In AbbVie's case, the company needs to find a replacement for its $19 billion-a-year arthritis drug Humira, while Bristol-Myers is too dependent on two key drugs.If pharma giants can’t keep themselves from making big and risky M&A bets, that doesn’t mean investors have to follow suit, or that they’d get much of an edge from doing so. While big pharma deals have resulted in longer-term gains for very patient investors in many cases, the returns don’t look as good compared to the broader market. Of the eight biopharma deals worth more than $40 billion that closed in the last 20 years, only one delivered better returns than the S&P 500 five years after it closed: Merck & Co.’s $47 billion acquisition of Schering-Plough Corp. in 2009 (1):That deal is arguably something of an accidental winner. Long-term success didn’t come from any of the products Merck targeted in the merger; instead, an afterthought of an antibody that was initially set to be sold off  became Keytruda, a cancer drug that’s projected to generate $15 billion in sales in 2021.Investors shouldn’t count on buried pipeline treasure to bail out the latest crop of big drug acquisitions. A better bet? Try an index fund.  (1) Not included in the group is Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.'s $62 billion purchase of Shire Plc, which closed in January, making return comparisons lessuseful.To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2019-06-28,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- One of the biggest losers in the S&P 500 Index this week is AbbVie Inc., which took a dive after the drugmaker announced one of the year’s biggest mergers. It’s emblematic of a trend that’s seen some of the most daring dealmakers punished for their pricey pursuits. CEOs considering large-scale M&A should take it as a note of caution heading into the second half of 2019. On the one hand, it’s not completely surprising that an acquirer’s stock would fall after announcing an acquisition, especially one as large as AbbVie’s $63 billion offer on Tuesday for Botox manufacturer Allergan Plc, a business that brings with it some $22 billion of net debt. But AbbVie’s 16% sell-off went beyond the typical post-deal dent, and it hasn’t recovered yet. It’s also not alone.It was a similar case on Monday when Eldorado Resorts Inc. struck a $17.3 billion deal for Caesars Entertainment Corp. to expand its casino portfolio, a transaction that came at the urging of billionaire activist hedge-fund manager Carl Icahn. Eldorado sank 11% that day. Earlier this month, investors also balked at United Technologies Inc.’s merger with $50 billion missile maker Raytheon Co., which will create a new behemoth in the aerospace and defense industry.The list goes on: Shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. have tumbled 17% to a more than decade low since it agreed to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. for $57 billion last month. And Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. still hasn’t reversed its 14% retreat in the wake of the January announcement that it’s acquiring Celgene Corp. in a transaction valued at more than $80 billion. In all, megadeals getting the thumbs down this year are worth about $440 billion. In recent years, investors had gone soft on dealmakers as the market got swept up in a merger wave that promised to revive earnings growth. In some cases, acquirers’ stock prices even headed higher on deal announcements, as shareholders were just glad to see the companies do something with all their cash.But this year, that’s changed. Companies are clearly being penalized for doing megadeals, which I define as transactions in the $20-billion-and-up range. This chart shows the average acquirer’s stock-price change on the first day its deal was announced:This trend is also interesting given the fact that megamergers are what’s currently driving the broader M&A market. The nine announced so far this year represent 30% of the total value of global M&A activity, a far higher proportion than in any of the last 20 years. (That's not including private equity-led buyouts.)In comparison, deals in the $1 billion to $5 billion range – considered the bread and butter of the M&A market – have dried up, as I wrote earlier this month. Global dealmaking was down 16% when that piece published; now it’s down just 2% on account of the recent flurry of megadeals. (I had wondered whether U.S. trade tensions with China and Mexico would derail future large-scale acquisitions, but so far that’s not the case.)Time and time again, it’s been shown that the acquiring companies in giant deals tend to lag behind the broader market in subsequent years. Just this week, my colleague Max Nisen drilled into data on pharmaceutical mergers, which showed that AbbVie’s sell-off may just be an early manifestation of what’s usually inevitable later on. While Big Pharma often has good reason for turning to big purchases, such as the loss of patent protection on blockbuster drugs, Max found that in most cases only very patient investors were rewarded in the long run, and even then the returns trailed the S&P 500. Companies in other industries – such as Campbell Soup Co., CVS Health Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. – have also disclosed writedowns because they overpaid for deals in recent years.It’s understandable if investors are feeling less giddy about megamergers.

With an upcoming quarterly dividend of 36 cents,  giving Pfizer stock a yield of 3.3%, PFE stock price may rise more in the near future.Source: Shutterstock Pfizer's $11.4 billion acquisition of Array BioPharma (NASDAQ: ARRY) could be a positive, near-term and long-term catalyst for Pfizer stock. The price tag of the deal looks relatively small. I used the word &quot;relatively&quot; because of  AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) subsequent, monstrous, $63 billion acquisition of Allergan (NYSE: AGN). Pfizer's more manageable deal strengthens Pfizer's biopharmaceutical unit and will accelerate the company's growth over the long-term.  * 7 F-Rated Stocks to Sell for Summer  Pfizer's AcquisitionArray may boost Pfizer stock by providing PFE with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, a potential first-in-class therapy for patients suffering from BRAF-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. According to the National Institute of Health, the BRAF gene &quot;provides instructions for making a protein that helps transmit chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOverall. Pfizer currently has 44 oncology projects in its pipeline. Of these. 12 are in Phase 3 and five have already been approved and are in the process of being registered. The pipeline includes biologics, small molecules, immunotherapies, and biosimilars.Source: PfizerPfizer has  many different types of approaches  it uses to target various types of tumors. Array primarily uses combination therapies. Its BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI  treatments have been approved for treating metastatic melanoma. Array is conducting over 30 clinical trials of its solid tumor treatments. Among its tumor treatments being tested is its BRAF-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) drug.In May, Array reported statistically significant improvements of the subjects being treated in a Phase 3 trial of its mCRC treatment. According to the data, the treatment reduced the risk of death of the patients taking it by 48%, compared to those in the control group. Array's Addressable MarketColorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the U.S. In 2018, around 140,250 patients were diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum. BRAF mutations occur in about 15% of the cases. So, Array may potentially treat over 21,000 patients annually. Nearly one-third of those diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum, or 50,000 people, die each year, according to estimates.But the owners of Pfizer stock barely reacted when PFE announced the Array deal. Compared to the $245 billion market cap of Pfuzer stock, the $11.4 billion acquisition is small. Nonetheless, the pipeline of cancer drugs that Pfizer acquired through the transaction could meaningfully boost  Pfizer's top line, lifting Pfizer stock in the process.  Moreover, developing cancer drugs  is typically expensive and requires lots of capital. So the acquisition will save PFE time and money and, under Pfizer's control,  the acquired unit will have more resources and cash that it can use to develop its drugs. The acquisition is expected to start increasing Pfizer's earnings per share in 2022. Analysts Are Mildly Upbeat on Pfizer StockWall Street analysts are mildly bullish on PFE stock. The eight analysts covering PFE stock have an average price target on the shares of $47.14, according to Tipranks. That's about 8.5% above PFE stock price. With the 3.32% dividend yield of Pfizer stock, the total return of PFE stock, judging by the average price target, is expected to be about 12%. The Bottom Line on Pfizer StockPfizer stock trades at price-earnings multiples that are below those of some of its peers, as shown in this P/E Multiples financial model. Additionally, in the next three years, the company is expected to deliver strong growth. Yet investors have been slow to recognize its potential.Moreover, by adding Array to its portfolio, PFE has greatly improved its pipeline while further distinguishing the company from other drug makers.

2019-07-02,"(Bloomberg) -- Here’s some good news for beleaguered International Business Machines Corp. investors: it’s about to become an aristocrat.Dividend forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show that the technology giant is poised to join the list of so-called Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividend in 25 consecutive years, in 2020. The ascendancy to dividend royalty comes amid a five-year slide in IBM’s stock price that has seen it pare 26% of its value.Getting added to the elite list will force funds that track Dividend Aristocrats, such as the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats exchange traded fund, to purchase shares of the Armonk, New York-based company.IBM would join Automatic Data Processing Inc. as only the second information technology firm on the 57 company list. The addition would boost the weight of the information technology sector in the group to match that of energy companies.Dividend UpdateLooking beyond the aristocrats, energy firms were the biggest contributors to dividend growth in the second quarter of 2019, according to Bloomberg specialists. Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., Diamondback Energy Inc., Kinder Morgan Inc. and EOG Resources Inc. had quarter over quarter dividend increases greater than 25% contributing to the sector’s 6% quarter over quarter growth.Key InsightsBloomberg doesn’t projects any sector to out gain its third quarter 2017 or 2018 quarterly dividend growthFinancials are expected to see the pace of growth drop to 5.5% from 12.4% in 3Q 2018.Among aristocrats, Bloomberg’s projected 12 month dividend yield is expected to reach 6.02% for AbbVie Inc. and 6.16% at AT&T Inc.The projected dividend yield on the KBW Bank Index surpassed the yield on the Dow Jones Utility Average a week ago for the first time since February 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg13 of the 24 companies in KBW’s index are expected to raise dividends or say they will consider doing so after the latest Federal Reserve stress tests&#92;--With assistance from Jessica Beatus, Christopher Rung and Zhuo Zhang.To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Tanzi in Washington at atanzi@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Tanzi at atanzi@bloomberg.net, Brandon KochkodinFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",IBM Is Set to Join Exclusive Group of Dividend Aristocrats

2019-07-03,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors may be digesting a deal from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. for Celgene Corp. and getting their teeth into AbbVie Inc.’s bid for Allergan Plc, but there are plenty of other large-cap biotechs and pharma still hungry for action.“Do not sleep on the summer,” Jefferies trading specialist Jared Holz cautioned clients in a note. “Conversations with several banking contacts suggest mergers will not slow down in what are normally seasonally slow months.”Who needs deals? The usual suspects -- large-cap drugmakers with patent cliffs and dwindling pipelines. With the top 20 drugmakers generating over $150 billion a year in free cash flow and facing slowing growth, “there’s high interest from big pharma and big biotech in making acquisitions,” Andy Acker, a lifesciences portfolio manager for Janus Henderson, said in a phone interview.With regards to whether those deals will be mega-mergers or smaller bolt-ons, “anything is possible,” Holz said via phone. Although there aren’t as many targets left as there were six months ago, larger-scale deals are just as likely as smaller ones, he said.He predicts the biggest catalyst for the second half may be a deal that closes before any political changes ahead of the 2020 election. “You want to beat the fundamental shift,” he said.While the number of drug sector deals in 2019 to-date are on pace to match 2018’s total, the volume has exceeded last year’s midpoint thanks to mega-cap deals, according to Bloomberg data.Potential TargetsVertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Incyte Corp. and Biogen Inc. are seen among the most likely targets for a large deal. Jefferies’ Holz and Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Alethia Young both called Biogen a “wildcard,” as the company could either be a buyer or seller. Other potential acquirers include Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Merck & Co., Sanofi, Novartis AG and Johnson & Johnson, as well as biotechs Gilead Sciences Inc. and Amgen Inc.While large caps launch the bulk of new drugs, more than half of the new medicines approved are developed from small and mid-cap company pipelines, according to Acker. This makes biotech catalysts a key focus for investors looking to own a stock before it gets bought.Still, 90% of new medicines in development never make it to market, Acker cautions, and for those drugs that do win regulatory approval they will still face a commercial risk, especially if they don’t get bought.Jefferies analyst Michael Yee found that the shares of half of all biotechs that didn’t get bought underperformed in the months that followed a new drug launch.Further reading: Slow Start to 2019 M&A Gathers Force With June’s Flood of DealsHighlights from biotech calendars for the second half:Amgen: A court decision or settlement on Amgen’s dispute with Sandoz over patents for its top-selling arthritis drug Enbrel.

2019-07-09,"There's nothing more satisfying that getting money for doing nothing. That's why dividend stocks hold so much appeal for portfolios. After a one-time investment, top dividend stocks will pay you year in and year out, for doing nothing except holding them. This has to be one of the greatest forces in all of investing. And everyone likes getting money for free.To that end, high-yielding dividend stocks could be an income seeker's or retiree's best friend.By focusing on those stocks with above-average yields, investors can truly supercharge their current income. The best part is that many of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500 aren't exactly risky names. We're talking huge companies with plenty of cash flows and earnings to back-up those payouts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 10 Best Stocks for 2019: A Volatile First Half The truth is, there are plenty of big-time stocks that are producing some serious income for their shareholders. Here are five of the best high-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500. Macerich Company (MAC)Dividend Yield: 9%Source: Shutterstock With a nearly 9% yield, Macerich (NYSE:MAC) tops the list as one of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500. That high yield can be explained in two ways: For starters, MAC is a real estate investment trust (REIT). As a REIT, the firm is required to pay out the bulk of its cash flows to investors as dividends in order to take advantage of lucrative tax breaks.The second reason is that Macerich is a retail real estate owner -- specifically a mall owner. As e-commerce has taken hold, stocks like MAC have taken it on the chin.Today, MAC stock sits at new eight-year lows.This could be a prime time to load up on such a high-yielding dividend stock. The reason is that MAC doesn't own slouch malls. Yes, junky Class B malls are dying, but premium Class A shopping malls are thriving. MAC owns 48 of these high-end malls and they continue to see high occupancy rates -- over 95% -- and sales per square foot -- around $869.Meanwhile, the firm continues to change its tenant mix to involve more experiences, dining and entertainment options. This has only boosted traffic and sales further.The point is, MAC is being unfairly cast aside with the lower mall operators. This has shown up in its ability to boost critical funds from operations (FFO) measures over the retail Armageddon. It has also continued to raise its standard dividend as well as pay special ones.All in all, Macerich is one high-yielding dividend stock to snag-up. Iron Mountain Inc (IRM)Dividend Yield: 7.64%Source: Orin Zebest via FlickrLike Macerich, Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) is also a REIT, but IRM is a tad bit different. The firm makes its money by owning records and data storage facilities around the world. In fact, Iron Mountain is the biggest provider of such facilities with more than 1,400 different locations.It turns out this is an incredibly profitable and needed niche. Key customers include nearly everyone in the Fortune 1000 as well as various government organizations. With retention rates as high as 98%, IRM is able to pull in some hefty cash flows from the &quot;rent&quot; it charges these customers. Last year, it was able to grow its total FFO by nearly 19% and boost its dividend by over 6%.The best part is that Iron Mountain continues to evolve. It's no secret that digital records and data creation is growing by leaps and bounds. To this end, IRM has expanded in datacenter, cloud and digital hard drive access for its clients.Given its leadership position in physical document storage, the firm has had great success in upselling these digital products to customers. And with higher margins for cloud storage, IRM should be able to keep the growth coming for years.  * 7 A-Rated Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 And yet, because of its quirky nature, investors don't really pay too much attention to Iron Mountain. That fact provides it with a whopping 7.64% dividend yield. Philip Morris International (PM)Dividend Yield: 5.66%Source: Taber Andrew Bain Via FlickrWe all know smoking is dying a quick death here in the United States. Even e-cigarettes are getting the evil eye from regulators, which is just fine for tobacco stock Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM).The key for PM is the &quot;international&quot; in its name. The firm operates and sells tobacco in over 180 countries and territories with the U.S. not being one of them. Emerging markets such as Indonesia, Russia, China, and India make up the bulk of the firms' revenues.And those revenues continue to rise as smoking still carries some &quot;cool&quot; factor in these regions and is considered a small luxury.  All in all, PM sold more than $29.6 billion dollars' worth of tobacco last year -- a 3.1% year-over-year jump.Philip Morris' future looks rosy as well.Big tobacco enjoys some big pricing power. Nicotine is an addictive substance and PM is able to pass on price increases to cover costs to consumers pretty easily. Secondly, the firm's IQOS heated-tobacco delivery system is seeing some very impressive numbers. Shipments for IQOS jumped 20% to reach 11.5 billion units in the firm's most recent quarter. All of this continues to strengthen the firm's cash flows, bottom line, and dividend prowess.The reality is, PM is one of the highest yielding dividend stocks because it's a hated vice firm. Not because fundamentals are bad. AbbVie (ABBV)Dividend Yield: 5.71%Source: Shutterstock The giant pharmaceutical firms have long been great dividend stocks. This includes biotech king AbbVie (NASDAQ:ABBV). Driving that fact has been its blockbuster drug Humira.Last year alone, the autoimmune-disease medication brought in nearly $20 billion for ABBV -- an increase of 8.2% over 2017's numbers. The drug has continued to drive ABBV's dividend -- currently at almost 6%.The problem is, Humira is facing the proverbial patent cliff sooner than later. Given that the drug is responsible for the bulk of AbbVie's revenues, this cliff shouldn't be taken lightly. And that's one of the reasons why the dividend stocks yield is so high.However, ABBV has a plan to replace that missing revenue. To begin with, the firm is buying out fellow biotech rival Allergan (NYSE:AGN). AGN features hits like Botox and other blockbusters in its umbrella. Meanwhile, AbbVie has recently scored several approvals that could turn into real cash cows over time. Add in its rich pipeline that is now more robust from the AGN buy and you have a recipe for continued cash flows.  * 10 Stocks That Should Be Every Young Investor's First Choice For investors, there's plenty of potential in the dividend stock and you can grab that potential at a very high yield. Williams (WMB)Dividend Yield: 5.35%Source: Shutterstock Pipeline firms have often been called the &quot;toll roads of the energy sector.&quot; That's because they are paid on the volume of oil and natural gas flowing through their systems. After a few years of simplification, the sector is now back to those roots. That includes top pipeline firm Williams (NYSE:WMB).WMB owns plenty of top-notch natural gas assets in key areas such as the Marcellus shale and the DJ Basin. These assets feature plenty of cash flows tied to their volumes. This provides less risk for Williams as many of these assets are paid via so-called &quot;take or pay&quot; contracts. And WMB's continues to add capacity and expansions to these prime pipelines and gathering systems. This will help expand WMB's cash flows further down the road.These moves seem to be working.Last quarter, WMB saw a big 12% boost to its quarter-over-quarter cash flow from operations, and a big 8% jump in its distributable cash flows. With that, management expects to be able to grow its dividend payout by between 10% and 15% this year. That's pretty impressive considering that WMB already yields 5.35%. With a full slate of expansion projects for the next few years, Williams should be able to keep the growth coming for years to come.For investors, pipelines have historically been some of the best dividend stocks. WMB is continuing that tradition.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any stock mentioned.

2019-07-11,"Here are two pharmaceutical companies that are presently being downgraded by analysts but that are expected to gain strength as the year progresses. It’s an inversion of the axiom, “Past performance is not guarantee of future results.” The risk of investing in them may be large but so are the potential rewards for farsighted investors.  AbbVieAbbVie (ABBV) has been experiencing a drop in its shares for the last several months. The major reason for its decline is its biologic immunology drug Humira accounting for the biggest part of its revenue.Humira sales have been weaker lately. Rated as one of the top-selling drugs in 2018, Humira started losing a competition with cheaper medicines in 2019. In the first quarter of this year, it brought in revenue of $4.45 billion, which is 5.6% less than the company’s last year revenue.AbbVie faced other setbacks. Its cancer drug Rova-T failed to become a great commercial success. AbbVie’s testing of Venclexta, a multiple myeloma drug, was not successful either and negatively affected its stock. Over the past 12 months, AbbVie’s shares dipped 14%. Its net earnings decreased to $1.65 per share in the first quarter of 2019, from $1.74 per share a year earlier.On June 25, AbbVie announced a definitive agreement to acquire Allergan (AGN) in a cash and stock transaction for a total consideration of $63 billion. The news worked to its financial disadvantage. As soon as AbbVie’s intentions became known, its stock sank 16%, because investors estimated its plans as a mistake. When investors recovered from the news, AbbVie’s stock went up - but only slightly so. As a result, for the last six months, analysts have strongly been advising to put any investment in AbbVie on hold. As of writing, the average price given by analysts to the company’s shares is $79.33, with only 10.95% upside. Yet there are positive signs that AbbVie can soon stop its downward progression. It has recently signed lucrative deals with Mylan NV and Amgen Inc (AMGN). It is also working on a new cancer drug called Imbruvica. The drug may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environment in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs.In June, Imbruvica was ranked as the fifth drug thought to become a blockbuster in the near future. According to EvaluatePharma, AbbVie’s new drug may bring it $9.5 billion in sales in 2024. The company’s two other drugs – Orilissa and Skyrizi – are also expected to sell well and thus enlarge its profits.  After the projection made by EvaluatePharma, Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn increased his price target to $84. He thinks that the sales from AbbVie’s cancer drugs and new immunology drugs will generate enough revenue to balance out the losses brought by Humira. Other analysts hope for the company’s strength, too. As AbbVie approaches its Q2 earnings release, analysts expect that it will report $2.21 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 10.5%.  The blogger Wolf Report agrees: “ I'm bullish on AbbVie. It remains one of my largest pharma stocks, and I'm willing to add more, should the opportunity present itself. And I believe that it now has, and may even improve going forward.”Analyst Ratings & Price Targets on AbbVie BiogenBiogen (BIIB) had a rough start of the year. Within the first six months of 2019, the company tumbled by 22.3%, erasing 17 billion in valuation. There are several reasons for Biogen’s unsightly decline. One is the failure of the Alzheimer’s project aducanumab. At two late-stage trials it became clear that the anti-amyloid MAb, which Biogen believed would clear amyloid lesions, could not prevent the disease.Biogen’s shares also dropped because of the competition with Novartis (NVS). Its drug Spinraza that cures pediatric spinal muscular atrophy and generates the bulk of its profits can be upstaged by Novartis’s recently approved medicine Zolgensma. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said in January that Zolgensma, which also treats spinal muscular atrophy in small children, could be more cost-effective than Biogen’s drug with a one-time price of $2 million. Biogen’s multiple-sclerosis franchise also failed to live up to its promise, undermined by a competition with such companies as Roches and Novartis. A preferable alternative to Biogen’s main MS medicines, Tysarabi and Tecfidera, Roches’ drug Ocrevus has been diminishing Biogen’s profits since the third quarter of 2017. This year, the competition between the MS medicine producers intensified, when Novartis introduced Mayzent that costs about $88,500 a year. This is about 7% less than Biogen’s Tysarabi and Tecfidera.But Biogen still has several ongoing medical trials to its credit. It is presently developing its next MS medicine Vumerity, whose approval might happen later this year. Investors may also follow Biogen’s earlier-stage pipeline for inherited disease of the eye, pain management, and cardiovascular disease. Biogen might also make several acquisitions in 2019. There are rumors that its recent purchase of Nightstar Therapeutics, a gene therapy company, will be followed by other acquisitions. Analysts suggest that such companies as Neurocrine Bioscience (NBIX), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) would enhance Biogen’s holdings. But even if no additional purchase is made, Nightstar Therapeutics can become for Biogen a useful springboard for building an eye disease franchise that will push its profit up in the coming several years. True, some analysts advise not to invest in Biogen for the time being, but there are others who are bullish on its stock. H.C.

2019-07-18,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Slimming down appears to be paying off for Novartis AG. CEO Vas Narasimhan has refocused the Swiss pharma giant around drugs by selling off eye-care business Alcon and its remaining consumer-health interests. Second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations Thursday and a big guidance boost showed the benefits of the strategy. Shares hit an all-time high in early trading even though the stock was already up over 20% year to date to that point and trades at a premium to peers. Novartis is benefiting from greater exposure to its drug business, which has more potential than the units it ditched. Simpler businesses are easier to understand and value, so it makes sense that the market has responded well to these moves. At this price, though, the strategy inherently exposes investors to more downside and volatility. The reason some drugmakers diversify is to add steadier revenue so they can better weather the booms, busts, and worrying product concentration that come with developing novel medicines. Novartis has a robust set of newer drugs, which is likely why it felt confident enough to get rid of other units. It has supplemented its arsenal further with a series of acquisitions as it continues its strategy by slimming down generic unit Sandoz.Psoriasis drug Cosentyx and heart medicine Entresto are the two drugs most key to the company’s near-term success. They helped drive the pharma unit’s 9 percent sales growth in the second quarter relative to the same period last year. There are high expectations for continuing growth, but they come with significant risks.A new rival from AbbVie Inc. recently entered the already crowded market Cosentyx competes in, and others are on the way. While Entresto has turned from a slow starter to a growing success story, a big chunk of its potential depends on expanding to new markets. Results are due from a late-stage trial in a new indication in the next few months. Positive indications will help justify the company’s current valuation. A failure could bring current momentum for the drug and Novartis’s more exposed stock screeching to a halt. Also, growth may not look as robust when sales begin to decline for two other blockbusters – cancer drug Afinitor and multiple sclerosis medicine Gilenya – in the next few years. That puts weight on the company’s most recent launches and pipeline. Those new products may be able to bear it; the company had a breast cancer drug, an MS medicine, and a groundbreaking gene therapy approved in the first half of the year. Late-stage data is due in the near term for potential blockbuster asthma and eye drugs as well as another MS drug. Still, weak launches or disappointing data could erode confidence in the company’s growth trajectory. Novartis executed its transition to a pure pharma firm well. There’s still a chance that the rapturous investor response is in part a sugar high. To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2019-08-12,"The decline in 3M (NYSE:MMM) continues. Despite an earnings beat, the quarterly report initiated another selloff in 3M stock.Source: Shutterstock Thankfully for longs, it did not happen in the dramatic fashion that affected the company in the first quarter.Nonetheless, it indicates MMM stock has not stopped falling. With stagnant growth forecasted and an ongoing trade war with no end in sight, I do not think investors should buy 3M at this time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 8 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now No Matter What  3M Wins and Still DisappointsIn a previous article, I proposed that 3M stock would not recover until the trade war ended. Since Asia makes up more than 30% of company revenues, I still do not see how the company prospers with uncertainty clouding such a large percentage of its revenue.So far, this theory held up through second-quarter earnings. Even beating on both revenue and profits could not rescue the stock. Consequently, it has stagnated in the low-$160s per share level, near a point where it turned around in early June.I agree with my colleague James Brumley who stated that conglomerates in today's business world make much less sense. However, unlike Brumley, I do not think the time has come to start comparing 3M to General Electric (NYSE:GE). I need to see more bad news before I will start believing that it will fall that far.While I disagree with InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto overall on 3M, I find myself almost as impressed with the packaging material called the &quot;Flex and Seal Shipping Roll.&quot; It might even become their most popular creation in decades. MMM Isn't CheapUnfortunately for traders, cool products do not necessarily beget hot stocks. Even with the stock trading at bargain prices compared to this winter, I do not see the 2019 drop in MMM as enough.The forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 17.2 stands well below S&P 500 averages. However, with profit growth expected to average 3.43% per year over the next five years, I would not call that multiple &quot;cheap.&quot;Moreover, the current dividend yield of about 3.5% significantly exceeds the S&P 500 average yield of 1.91%. The six decades of annual payout hikes build further confidence in both the dividend and the company itself.Still, that payout now costs the company 67.55% of its net income, up from just 37% in 2011. While I do not think the company would end dividend hikes unless it was unavoidable, the payout has become a tremendous burden.However, as I implied earlier, any doomsday prediction is premature at this stage. Perhaps the company will spin off divisions to improve their focus. Maybe their packaging material or other product will bring investors back to 3M.Still, investors looking for a beleaguered stock in an established company with a decades-long history of dividend increases have more choices than 3M stock.Companies such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offer forward multiples in the single digits and payouts which rise every year and offer a yield exceeding 5%. Moreover, the path to recovery for both equities appears more evident than that of MMM stock. The Bottom Line on 3M Stock3M faces too much uncertainty to buy at current levels. One might think an earnings beat would send MMM stock higher, particularly after the massive selloff that followed its first-quarter report.However, with its business in China facing uncertainty and its profit growth modest, investors have shown little inclination to pay 17.2 times forward earnings.Moreover, a dividend payout ratio approaching 70% should create concerns about its six-decade streak of payout hikes.3M is no GE. Company management still has time to turn this ship around. However, investors can find cheaper stocks which pay higher dividend yields and have a clearer path to recovery.As of this writing, Will Healy is long ABBV stock.

That's particularly true in the investing world. It's even true across investing disciplines. Sober value investors wait for their price before buying, but disciplined market technicians also know to wait for the proper setup before trading.Sometimes, you need to wait for a fundamental catalyst to make your trade worth making. Other times, it's simply a matter of waiting for the right price. But the key is having the self-control to wait for your moment.

2019-08-29,"Shares of AbbVie Inc.  rose 1.5% in premarket trade Thursday after the company announced it had shut down its troubled Rova-T research and development program. The drugmaker said it was discontinuing a late-stage trial of Rova-T as a potential treatment for advanced small-cell lung cancer after interim data showed patients on the drug had no survival benefit compared with those on placebo. &quot;Small-cell lung cancer continues to be one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers where there is a significant need for transformative therapies. We are disappointed with this outcome for the patients who suffer from this disease,&quot; said Margaret Foley, global head of solid tumor development at AbbVie. The closure of the Rova-T program comes after several other trial setbacks for the drug.

2019-09-10,"The past several weeks have been raucous ones for all stocks, but particularly wild ones for healthcare stocks. Not only is the future of the nation's healthcare market in flux, drug companies are facing an inordinate degree of litigation, and biopharma names have dished out plenty of R&D updates … some good, some bad.By and large, the bearish market-wide tide and the weakness healthcare stocks have suffered has become something of an opportunity. A handful of these names have become bargains and are ripe for recoveries.  * 10 Stocks to Sell in Market-Cursed September To that end, here's a rundown of ten healthcare stocks to buy, even if they're surrounded by bad news and grim headlines. Some are familiar, and others are not. All of them, however, arguably boast more potential than risk at this time, even if not all of them have yet to reach their worst-case-scenario price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has arguably faced the worst and most alarming headlines of late, facing not one but two major legal battles.The first one of course is its liability linked to asbestos contained in its talcum powder sold under the brand name Johnson & Johnson. The other? Some states' attorneys general are suggesting J&J was culpable for what's turned into a nationwide opioid addiction epidemic. A closer inspection of both matters reveals the ultimate liability for both may not be as dire as is currently believed.Though the state of Oklahoma recently won a case that will fine Johnson & Johnson $572 million for allowing opioid abuse to become a &quot;public nuisance,&quot; that figure was smaller than shareholders had feared, and may point to similarly small figures in other state-level cases.As for its talcum powder woes, the company is prevailing in some state courts, and losing in others. With the exception of one case in California, the awards granted in cases it has lost have been relatively modest. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) shares are down nearly 50% from their early 2018 high, reaching another multi-month low in August.The underpinnings for that weakness aren't difficult to deduce. Aside from an increasingly tough battle to defend its patents on breadwinner drug Humira, the decision to acquire Allergan (NYSE:AGN) hasn't been a particularly popular one with shareholders.ABBV stock owners have also been disappointed by a couple of major busts on the R&D front. The company's work in turning Rova-T into a successful lung cancer treatment, for instance, was thrown away when AbbVie ended phase 3 trials after it failed to create meaningful results.  * 7 &quot;Boring&quot; Stocks With Exciting Prospects The punishment, so to speak, hasn't fit the crime though. AbbVie now quietly rates as one of the top healthcare stocks to buy at its now greatly-lowered price thanks to a dividend yield of 6.44% that's reasonably well protected, and a forward-looking P/E of only 7.. CVS Health (CVS)Source: Shutterstock Admittedly, it remains unclear which sliver of the healthcare market will be the one to bear the brunt of any cost-cutting reform. Hospitals and insurers are just as targeted as pharmacy names like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), which is a key part of the reason CVS stock has been nearly cut in half since the middle of 2015.That doubt is rooted in a paradigm shift that isn't likely to happen, however, or at least not as abruptly as some are fearing.Case in point: Just days after announcing plans to eliminate the rebate enjoyed by pharmacies and pharmacy benefits managers, President Donald Trump backpedaled. Although it's not clear where the pressure for the reversal came from, clearly someone is in the industry's corner.In the meantime, CVS is preparing for all contingencies. It now owns health insurer Aetna and is tiptoeing into the medical device arena. In July the company announced it was beginning trials of an at-home kidney dialysis solution. Bausch Health Companies (BHC)Source:  n4i Via FlickrYou may recognize the name as one that has specialized in eye care for a long time now. And Bausch -- Bausch + Lomb, to be precise -- certainly still makes contact lenses and eye-surgery products. This is not the Bausch Health Companies (NYSE:BHC) in question, however. While Bausch Health owns and operates Bausch + Lomb, the Bausch that has earned a spot on a list of healthcare stocks to buy is actually the company formerly known as Valeant Pharmaceuticals.That name will also ring a bell for most investors … although not a good one. That's the company that went on an aggressive acquisition spree, planning on buying specialty drugs to then mark their price up to unnecessarily expensive levels.In addition to public outcry, congress got involved, ultimately forcing then-CEO Michael Pearson out, and forcing new CEO Joseph Papa to rebuild everything the company is, and does.  * 7 Best Stocks That Crushed It This Earnings Season Surprise! He's doing it. Though it's still erratic and somewhat unpredictable, sales are expected to grow 1.6% this year, and 3% next. It's not much, but it's enough to drive real earnings growth. Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT)Source: Shutterstock Intercept Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ICPT) isn't an easy name to own. Although the biopharma outfit is driving major sales growth with its chronic liver disease drug Ocaliva, the company's a one-trick pony that's still losing money. Last quarter's top line of $66.3 million -- mostly Ocaliva -- was up 53% year-over-year, but still let Intercept book an operating loss of $63.6 million and a total net loss of $71.4 million.In this case though, the company's fiscal trajectory against the backdrop of an obesity epidemic translates into a bright future. Intercept Pharmaceuticals is also working on a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug that takes aim at what is expected to be the leading cause of liver failure by 2020. That under-served market could be worth $50 billion, if not more, leaving this company amazingly well-positioned for growth. Pfizer (PFE)Source: Manuel Esteban/Shutterstock Stripping out last month's 20% stumble, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has been a pretty good bet in recent years. Thing is, the aspects that have made PFE stock one of the best healthcare stocks to buy for a long while now are still in place. That is, a diverse portfolio that doesn't lean too much on any one drug. No one product accounts for more than 10% of the company's total revenue.The selloff, for the record, was spurred by the decision to sell its 'off patent' drug business operating as Upjohn to rival Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL). The downside of that exit appears to be fully priced in now though, and then some.  * The 8 Worst Stocks to Buy Before the Trade Turmoil Cools Off In the meantime, a $500 million investment in a North Carolina manufacturing facility pushes the company deeper into gene therapy waters, which may offer more upside than existing business lines. PRA Health Sciences (PRAH)Source: Shutterstock When investors thinks of healthcare stocks, PRA Health Sciences (NASDAQ:PRAH) isn't a name that generally comes to mind. Indeed, most investors may have never even heard of it.The one who have heard of it, meanwhile, might be wishing they hadn't. Even with this year's choppy rebound effort, shares of the contract research organization are still down 19%.A bet against PRA Health Sciences hasn't been a particularly wise bet in the grand scheme of things. Contracted research is a key part of the future of healthcare, as outsourcing R&D becomes the more cost-effective solution.PRA Health has the numbers to prove it, too. This year's expected 6.4% revenue growth isn't jaw-dropping, but it's reliable, as will be next year's projected 8.4% top-line growth. Better still, that progress is driving even greater profit growth. Per-share profits are expected to reach $5.03 this year, up from last year's $4.28, and grow 13% to $5.68 per share next year. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN)Source: Shutterstock Last week, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) shares started what would end up becoming a 14% plunge. The selloff may not be done yet either. The prod? Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is challenging Alexion's patent on Soliris, which is used to treat a trio of rare diseases. It makes up the bulk of Alexion's sales.It's an alarming development, although not one that's necessarily devastating. Right or wrong, running patent-based interference meant to disrupt other companies is the new norm within the pharmaceuticals arena, and there's not necessarily any assurance that Amgen will prevail. The chatter that Amgen could make an acquisition bid for Alexion still has its merits as well.  * 10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever In the meantime, the forward-looking P/E of 9.9 suggests ALXN is priced cheaply enough to survive any profit-sharing agreement that Amgen may end up pursuing instead of an outright legal victory. Cigna (CI)While pharmacies and pharmaceuticals are certainly vulnerable to any sweeping overhauls in the way the United States healthcare industry works, it's not like the insurers are particularly well-shielded. Cigna (NYSE:CI), for instance, is down more than 30% since its early 2018 high on concerns about insurers' futures, after they all had a pretty good run between 2013 and 2017.Not everyone is concerned about one of a myriad of 'maybes' that could impact Cigna though.Alliance Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes is one of those optimists. He recently upgraded CI stock while it was down, re-rating it at an &quot;Outperform,&quot; explaining &quot;We are increasing our price target and rating on [Cigna] based upon earnings growth driven from deal synergies and its low valuation, which we believe offset our [long term] concerns on policy risks and strategic position.&quot;CI stock is trading at only 14 times its trailing earnings, and only 8.2 times next year's expected profits. Eli Lilly (LLY)Source: Shutterstock Finally, add drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) to your list of healthcare stocks to buy despite a recent wave of bad news.For Lilly, that's mostly been spurred by pipeline and portfolio questions. In March it announced it would launch a cheaper alternative to its own top-selling Humalog insulin, and early this year it decided to acquire Loxo Oncology at an unpopularly frothy premium.There's a reason that slide suffered during the first half of the year has started to reverse course beginning in early August. Not only did Lilly win the outcome it wanted in a recent arbitration claim regarding a collaboration it entered with Adocia to develop rapid-acting insulin, a phase 3 trial of its oral JAK inhibitor Baricitinib as a therapy for atopic dermatitis showed tremendous promise with last month's update.They're little victories that can really add up in investors' heads.As of this writing, James Brumley held no position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-03,"When investors think of &quot;insider trading,&quot; they might think of the kind of behavior to which ex-Rep. Chris Collins recently pleaded guilty. In that case, Collins used material, nonpublic information he gained from his seat on a biotechnology company's board to tip off his son and fiancée's father, who were able to sell shares before the info became public.But some insider trading is legal. And in some cases, insider buying can signal to regular investors that something positive might be in the offing.Insiders - directors, officers and shareholders that own more than 10% of at least one class of the company's stock - can (and do) buy and sell shares, sometimes frequently. They must abide by certain rules, such as not selling shares within six months of purchase. They also must disclose any transactions to the SEC - and these insider filings are available for public viewing, free of charge, on the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) website.No one understands the challenges and victories of a public company better than the officers and directors who run it. Thus, when knowledgeable insiders buy or sell the company's shares, savvy investors take note. Sometimes these trades are habitual and mean nothing - but sometimes, they can signal a change in sentiment. A sudden spurt of insider buying may signal new products coming to market or new customers signing up, or simply reflect an insider's conviction that the stock is undervalued.Here are 10 stocks that have seen notable insider trading over the past few months. Investors shouldn't act solely on the basis of this recent insider buying - instead, it's just one factor to consider when evaluating these or any other stocks. But in each case, the buying stands out for its size or irregularity, which sometimes can be taken as a sign of insider optimism.

Here's why they earned a spot on watchlists. Applied Materials (AMAT)It has been anything but a straight-line move, but Applied Materials shares have made reliable progress since December's bottom. The ebbs and flows have left behind a well-defined set of rising support and resistance levels, plotted as light blue dashed lines on both stock charts.Assuming the pattern is still repeating itself, there's more upside ahead following August's rebound. Last week and this week gave us more evidence that AbbVie is en route to the upper boundary of its trading range. On the other hand, a couple of new concerns have taken shape.  *   Click to EnlargeChief among the concerns is the possibility that horizontal resistance has taken shape around $52.40, where the stock topped out in July and then again in September.  * The other bearish red flag here is the lack of volume behind the current advance, and the fact that the weekly chart's momentum is waning. That is, the once-rising MACD lines are flattening out.  * The good news is, the purple 50-day moving average line served as technical support last week and this week, upping the odds of a breakout beyond the ceiling at $52.40. Chubb (CB)The bears have tried to knock Chubb off of its bullish course several times since December's low. Each time the bulls stepped up to the plate, rekindling the rally. The end result is the establishment of a rising support line marked in yellow on both stock charts.That floor is being tested now thanks to this week's selloff. But, this time is notably different than the prior instances. This time, CB stock is ripe for a lot of profit-taking, and the bulls are on their heels. One more bad day could start a selling avalanche.  *   Click to EnlargeOn the weekly chart the vulnerability is evident in two ways. One of them is the fact that shares reached a full RSI-overbought condition in August. The other is this week's MACD crossunder.  * Those aren't the only red flags on the weekly chart. While it took a day-by-day effort to make it happen, the sheer size and scope of the setback this week translates into the biggest weekly selloff since October of last year. That sweeping change of heart (for no discernible reason) is telling in and of itself.  * Underscoring this week's big losses are a couple of days of high volume selling. The would-be sellers have largely tipped their hand. They're worried. AbbVie (ABBV)After an incredible 2017, AbbVie investors have experienced little more than misery. Shares peaked in early 2018, and the downtrend in the meantime was renewed just around each time it looked like it would finally come to a close.The rebound effort that's taken shape since August may end the same way. But, the bottom leading into that rebound was different than any of the previous ones. It may have cut deep enough to act as a capitulation. We need one more good 'umph' to know for sure, as that would finally get a pent-up rebound underway.  *   Click to EnlargeThe make-or-break line now is the line that connects all the key peaks since May of last year, plotted as a red dashed line on both stock charts. That resistance is being tested right now.  * The selling may have hit a climax and set the stage for a prolonged reversal in August, as the weekly chart finally saw its RSI indicator line finally move to the sub-20, oversold level then.  * Underscoring the bullish case is the recent action at and around the gray 100-day moving average line. ABBV stock failed to hurdle that line on three attempts earlier this year, but found support there at the beginning of this month (highlighted).As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-10-22,"Investors have voted with their wallets, and the verdict is in: they want income and growth. That shouldn’t be surprising, as income and growth are the keys to profitable investing, but market conditions have been volatile in the last 12 months. With share appreciation unreliable, investors have turned to dividends.Dividends offer the steady income stream that investors want, while the top dividend stocks are available at a relative discount to market prices. According to Cole Hunter, a top strategist with Goldman Sachs, “The Dividend Growth basket … now trades at nearly the largest discount to the median S&P 500 stock since 2006.” He has assembled a list of stocks which he expects to both beat the S&P’s average dividend yield by a wide margin, and extend that margin through sustained dividend growth in the coming three years.We’ve used TipRanks’ Stock Screener tool to further sort Hunter’s list of dividend champs, and find three with Buy ratings and great prospects for mid-term growth.Citizens Financial (CFG)The banking industry has had its ups and downs in recent years. It never really recovered the reputation lost in the 2008 Great Recession, even though most big banks had, by the end of 2009, paid the government back for money received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The long years of low-interest rates from 2009 through 2015, under the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing policy, bit into lending profits but that pressure eased with the return of rate increases in December 2015. The rate cuts earlier this summer bode ill for the banking industry’s loan segments.At the same time, however, earnings are up and expected to continue gaining. Citizens Financial, a long-standing name in the US banking industry, exemplifies the conflicting trends the industry faces, and the strength it has to weather the possible storms. With a $15 billion markets cap and more than 1,100 branches in 11 states, CFG ranks 13th in size among American banks. Its $6.13 billion in 2018 revenues led to a net income that year of $1.72 billion and the company’s quarterly earnings have been steady increasing through 2019.Better yet, for income investors, CFG offers an annualized dividend yield of 4.05%, more than double the S&P average of 2.01%. The payment, $1.44 per share, is made in quarterly installments of 36 cents. According to Goldman Sachs’ Hunter, CFG’s yield is likely to reach 4.6% by the end of 2020, and through the combination of appreciation and dividends, investors will see an estimated return of 5.1% by 2021.CFG’s firm position in its industry underlies the stock’s generally favorable reviews from Wall Street analysts. The stock received two Buy ratings last week, from RBC Capital and Evercore ISI.Writing from RBC, 5-star analyst Gerard Cassidy reiterated his Buy on the stock, and set a $40 price target. As his bottom line, Cassidy said, “Earnings were essentially in line with expectations, reflecting strong fee income, which was led by mortgage banking, slightly lower credit costs and operating expenses. Though the company's fee revenue was strong in the quarter, net interest income was adversely impacted by a lower NIM… with its 10.3% CET1 ratio, [CFG] is well capitalized.” Cassidy’s target suggests a 12% upside to this stock. (To watch Cassidy's track record, click here)Evercore’s John Pancari sees a similar path forward for CFG, saying, “CFG’s evolving business model is benefiting from momentum in fee businesses and a greater overall fee contribution – helping temper the impact of lower rates. CFG remains prudent in actively returning capital. Accordingly, we expect this positioning to continue to present upside to the stock’s discount valuation over time.”Overall, CFG holds a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, with recent reviews including 2 buys, 1 hold, and 1 sell. Shares are trading at $35.58, so the average price target of $41 gives CFG an upside potential of 15%.

The AbbVie faced risk on the Humira front, however, as the patent on the popular biologic anti-inflammatory drug has expired and competition is growing. A risk management strategy is essential here, as Humira accounts for approximately 50% of the company’s drug division revenue.Revenue remains strong. For fiscal 2018, AbbVie reported a $32.75 billion revenue stream, from which it derived a $6.38 billion income. Earnings per share have been increasing steadily since Q4 2018, and have beaten the forecasts in 1H19. The Q3 forecast is for $2.29 per share.All of this gives AbbVie, like CFG, a solid foundation for profits, investor rewards, and growth. The company has been raising the dividend payment steadily for the last six years, showing confidence in itself and a commitment to returning income to investors. The current payment, of $1.07, annualizes to $4.28 and represents an impressive yield of 5.54%; in fact, AbbVie has the highest yield of the stocks in this article. According to Cole Hunter’s estimates, ABBV’s yield will increase to 6.1% next year, and by 2021 the return on cash invested should reach 6.6%.Cowen analyst Steve Scala likes this stock, basing his assessment and Buy rating on a meeting with company management. He came away from that meeting with confidence in management’s plans for business and acquisition goals, in its new product portfolio, and its strategies to manage risk to the Humira profits. Scala’s $90 price target shows that confidence, as it indicates a 16% upside to the stock. (To watch Scala's track record, click here)Writing from Piper Jaffray, 5-star analyst Christopher Raymond was impressed by the company’s new drugs, especially Skyrizi and Rinvoq. He says, “Just putting pen to paper, 5% RA market share in our model equates to annual US revenue of ~$1.3B -- a run rate… that far exceeds our FY20 estimate of $400M.”All in all, Wall Street loves AbbVie. TipRanks tracking of 5 analyst ratings on the company shows a consensus Strong Buy, with 4 analysts recommending Buy and only one recommending Hold. The average price target is $86.33, representing a 10% upside from current levels. (See AbbVie stock analysis on TipRanks)Valero Energy (VLO)With our third stock, we move over to the energy industry. This cash-rich sector faced headwinds in the form of high overhead, heavy government regulation, and a lingering worry that Congress will shift farther left, pushing anti-fossil fuel policies, or that a Democratic White House victory next year will usher in an anti-oil stance. For now, however, mid- and downstream player Valero holds a stable position in the markets.The company operates refineries, pipelines, and retail outlets for the manufacture and distribution of gasoline, diesel fuel, other petroleum distillates and fuels, and energy. Valero doesn’t extract the fossil fuels. Rather, it processes the raw products into usable forms, transports the refined products to market, and sells them. Owning the means to do this, along with the final sellable product, Valero maintains control over its business model.Valero is one of the largest retail companies in the US, with 15 refining plants and over 6,800 outlets in the US, Canada, Caribbean, and UK. The company saw $117 billion in total revenues in the last fiscal year, which brought in $4.57 billion in net income. The large discrepancy underlines the high overhead common in the energy industry, while the high net income shows that energy remains profitable.Returning profits to investors has long been a priority for Valero. The company currently shows a dividend yield of 3.86%, translating to a $3.60 annualized payout. The quarterly payment comes to 90 cents per share, and the company has been raising it steadily for the last five years. In 2014, the quarterly dividend was just 27.5 cents. Goldman’s Hunter sees investors benefiting from a higher 4.5% yield next year, while the overall return should reach 4.9% in 2021.Writing from Wells Fargo, analyst Roger Read said back in August, “Valero is well-positioned to participate in increasing discounted domestic crude volumes along the Gulf Coast, especially as IMO 2020 is implemented.  In 2018 and 2019, Valero's expected operating performance and commitment to shareholder returns via dividends and share repurchases appears to be favorably affecting its valuation multiples.” (To watch Read's track record, click here)Since writing those lines, Read has reiterated his thesis on Valero, and boosted his price target. His new target, $108, implies an upside of 15% to the stock.It’s not often that the analysts all agree on a stock, so when it does happen, take note. VLO’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 7 Buys. The stock’s $99 average price target suggests a modest upside of 5% and a change from the current share price of $94.

Let's take a look at a few top stock trades as the markets continue to roll higher. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is barely in positive territory following its earnings report, but the technical setup is not that appealing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares tried to break out over the $180 level, but failed to hold onto its gains. The silver lining here? BABA stock is still above short-term uptrend support (purple line), as well as its cluster of major moving averages between $171 and $173.A move below uptrend support would negate the breakout, while a decline below its moving averages would be a sign of caution. Below $170 and uptrend support (blue line) is in play near $165.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week Over $180 and the breakout is back on the table, with the first upside target being Friday's post-earnings high, followed by the September high of $184.13. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Pinterest (PINS)For most of our pre-earnings setups, we don't need to revisit them a day later. For Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), though, the stock's major decline is forcing us to take a second look.Shares were down more than 25% at one point, just below the $19 IPO price. With Friday's sharp rebound though, bulls have a tradable low to measure against. On the upside, see if PINS can rally back to its prior post-IPO low near $23. Above that and it can fill the gap up toward $25.Below Friday's low and PINS is a no touch. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: AbbVie (ABBV)AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock has been on fire, and Friday's post-earnings rally is only adding fuel to that fire. The stock is nearing overbought territory on a weekly basis, and has long since cleared prior downtrend resistance (blue line).Let's see if the 100-week moving average gives ABBV any issues, up at $83.50. Over it and the 52-week highs near $90 are on the table. If the 100-week moving average is resistance, see if ABBV finds support either at the 50-week or 200-week moving average.The stock was recently called a breakout buy for 2019. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Chevron (CVX)Despite bouncing around on the day, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is near flat after reporting earnings. This one has become a bit of a sloppy setup.The upside is clogged by a cluster of moving averages between $118 and $120. On the downside, the February gap between $112 and $113 has generally been support For CVX stock this year.Let's keep it simple.A dip into this zone can be bought, provided it holds as support. If it fails, a flush down to the $105 to $107 area could be in the cards. A break over $120 could send CVX up to $124-plus. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 5: U.S. Steel (X)Want to stick with the keep-it-simple approach? U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) is jumping on Friday, but running into an important level.If it moves over the $13 to $13.25 level and the 100-day moving average, X stock can continue higher. It puts the 78.6% retracement at $14.60 in play, as well as the declining 200-day moving average.If it falls below $13, lower prices may be in store. Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 6: Funko (FNKO)It has been a while since we've talked about Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO). $17 and channel support both gave way on Friday, leading to a flood of selling. Shares are now near $15.Below the 23.6% retracement and near its session low, there's little confidence in Funko right now.Friday's move technically puts the $12 area in play, although it may take a while to flush down to that point. From here, see if FNKO can reclaim $15.15, the 23.6% retracement. Above it puts the underside of prior channel support in play. Below $15 and shares can remain under pressure.Funko is also a no-touch for me at this moment.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

2019-11-08,"[Editor's note: &quot;10 Medical Marijuana Stocks to Cure Your Portfolio&quot; was previously published in October 2019. It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.] Invariably, no other investment class generates as much interest and controversy as marijuana stocks. Within a generation, public sentiment toward legalization shifted dramatically from strongly opposed to mostly supportive. This is largely due to demographics, as the more progressive millennials replace older Americans in positions of influence.Additionally, marijuana stocks represent a viable economic channel that can help bridge the gap for many states' financial issues. For instance, green-friendly Colorado enjoys significant tax revenues from its botanical industry. I don't see this trend changing for the worse anytime soon, as awareness and popularity is only increasing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOf course, cannabis isn't without its controversies. Primarily, the federal government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, putting it on par with hardcore narcotics like cocaine. Thus, no matter how liberal some states become toward their agricultural ambitions, the specter of federal oversight and crackdowns keeps many entrepreneurs and businesses away.However, we have one critical exception to the rule: marijuana stocks that specialize in medicinal and therapeutic benefits. For one thing, medical cannabis mitigates the stereotypical image of potheads and general no-gooders. Plus, people experiment with pharmaceuticals all the time. Why not allow these same patients the choice for natural alternatives?  * 7 Retail Stocks to Avoid for the Holidays More critically for marijuana stocks, the medicinal aspect offers the best chance for international acceptance. Currently, very few jurisdictions allow recreational weed. Given the abundance of traditional and conservative nations, a green world is unlikely. But as Thailand and South Korea demonstrated, medical cannabis is a much easier sell.As a result, you want exposure not just to marijuana stocks, but also to the therapeutic element. Here are 10 names to consider: AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Shutterstock Whenever you have a discussion about cannabis stocks, chances are, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) isn't the first name you think about. One of the healthcare sector's blue chips, ABBV stock has soared on its vast therapeutic pipeline.We're talking mainstream solutions for common ailments and diseases like arthritis and plaque psoriasis.Still, AbbVie maintains some botanical credibility with its Marinol therapy. A synthetic cannabis-based drug, Marinol addresses chemotherapy-related side effects, such as vomiting or nausea. In addition, it helps restore appetite among AIDS patients.Of course, you should note that Marinol isn't among AbbVie's top-selling products. Therefore, you're only getting limited exposure to cannabis with ABBV stock. But based on the extreme volatility of marijuana stocks, that isn't such a bad gig. Emerald Health Therapeutics (EMHTF)Source: Shutterstock Not that I would know, but growing cannabis allegedly isn't rocket science.With the right conditions, the right equipment and a reasonable car, anyone can grow their stash. But cultivating the plant so that it addresses specific ailments and symptoms? That takes real effort, which is where Emerald Health Therapeutics (OTCMKTS:EMHTF) comes in.Rather than just pumping out the green stuff, Emerald deliberately seeks out the strains most effective in addressing patients' needs. The company provides a wide selection of strains, which range in weight, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content, and cannabidiol (CBD) strength. Their impressive portfolio should lift EMHTF stock over the long run, as interest in CBD products accelerates.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Avoid for the Holidays It's important to be careful with pot stocks, though. On a year-to-date basis, EMHTF stock is down 75%. While all cannabis stocks suffer volatility risk, Emerald's concentration on medicinal weed should help mitigate downside pressure. Aurora Cannabis (ACB)Source: Shutterstock I've spent a lot of time discussing Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB), and I don't mean to keep double-dipping into this company. Still, I keep going back for a reason: ACB stock is an excellent play within the medical-marijuana market.A key factor in my bullishness for Aurora is its management team. In my view, they're making smart decisions through their acquisitive strategy.Rather than merely focusing on outright capacity, they're looking out over the horizon. Aurora's buyout of Whistler Medical Marijuana gave the organization significant leverage in medical cannabis due to Whistler's extensive genetics bank.Furthermore, ACB stock is a strong performer. In the beginning of the year, shares skyrocketed roughly 70% before plummeting. It's down 28% this year. The inevitable correction should be only temporary. Among marijuana stocks, Aurora is exceptionally well-positioned for sustainable growth. Cronos Group (CRON)Source: Shutterstock One of the top names among major marijuana stocks, Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON) naturally attracts a lot of attention. This time, though, they're attracting the wrong kind.Prior to its earnings report for the second quarter, I worried about the company's revenue target.Hit or exceed it, and management can stave off criticism, but speculators looking for a discounted price may want to put CRON stock back on their radar. After concerns about vaping safety hit the news, Cronos has shed all of this year's gains and more, as it's down nearly 24% YTD.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Avoid for the Holidays Plus, Cronos has international legitimacy among medicinally focused cannabis stocks. Featuring partnerships and joint ventures across five continents, the company is ahead of the game. CannTrust (CTST)In business, even the green kind, you can't get ahead of yourself. So while lucrative opportunities exist in the international sector, CannTrust (NYSE:CTST) remains firmly committed to winning its native Canadian market.At the same time, CannTrust can't afford to ignore the rest of the world. Although Canada becoming the first G7 nation to legalize recreational weed generated headlines, our northern neighbors alone can't support this burgeoning industry.Therefore, management has focused on the growth and capacity narrative to compete effectively at home and, later, abroad.To achieve the second leg of this journey, CannTrust teamed up with Denmark's Stenocare to distribute medical cannabis products in that country.It also inked a partnership with an Australian firm for similar distribution arrangements. While it's not the most common name among marijuana stocks, CTST stock provides a risky, but viable, opportunity. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)Most marijuana stocks focus on the industry's front face; namely, production. As I mentioned earlier, marijuana isn't that difficult to grow. So long as you have the green light legally, the physical barrier to entry is relatively short.But the real challenge, though, is finding a consistent source of financing. This is where Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) lends a helping hand.Despite momentum toward legalization, several financial institutions shy away from cannabis ventures.Innovative Industrial plugs the gap, offering critical capital through its leaseback business model.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Avoid for the Holidays Thanks to the company's tremendous utility, IIPR stock has lit up the markets. Shares are currently up more than 75% YTD. Technically, IIPR may have gotten a bit overheated. That said, I wouldn't get too greedy looking for the perfect entry point. Innovative Industrial levers a proven business model that is only increasing in relevancy. Terra Tech (TRTC)Everyone recognizes cannabis stocks for two things: their incredible potential and their equally incredible volatility. Unfortunately, stakeholders of medical-cannabis producer Terra Tech (OTCMKTS:TRTC) find themselves in the latter category.So far this year, TRTC stock is down around 53%.And the bad news doesn't end there. Terra Tech only had $1.9 million of cash at the end of Q2.So why take a bet on TRTC stock? First, its vertically integrated organization may facilitate significant efficiencies as political momentum increases. Second, I dig their leadership team. The head execs are experts in finance, which should prove beneficial in properly navigating TRTC across choppy waters. Charlotte's Web (CWBHF)Source: Shutterstock When most people look at Charlotte's Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF), they're thinking that they missed the boat. After all, CWBHF stock jumped 78% at the beginning of this year.From the opening price this year, however, Charlotte's Web shares are down over 10%.As much as I love marijuana stocks, I'm fairly certain that this cannabis firm is due for a further pullback. But once that occurs, I wouldn't waste too much time squabbling over the granularity.Instead, I'd consider what our own Matt McCall had to say. Thanks to the popularity of CBD, Charlotte's Web's CBD-based products could be distributed across mainstream retail channels.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Avoid for the Holidays Unquestionably, such an event would launch CWBHF stock into the stratosphere. Moreover, because most CBD products contain no trace of THC, they don't fall under severe federal guidelines. Therefore, don't get too greedy looking for an ideal price point when CWBHF corrects. Cannabis Science (CBIS)On paper, Cannabis Science (OTCMKTS:CBIS) represents the next evolution among cannabis stocks: pharmaceutical firms that devote their time and research exclusively toward medical marijuana.Not only that, this is a much-needed development that could lift CBIS stock, as well as the entire botanical industry.For decades, people unquestionably trusted the mainstream healthcare and pharmaceutical network.However, the rapidly escalating opioid crisis has proven that well-intentioned medical professionals can lever a tragic impact. One of the underlying causes of this crisis is the addictiveness of prescribed medicines.Organizations like Cannabis Science can potentially mitigate this situation with naturally sourced therapies free of psychoactive side-effects. That's the allure of CBIS stock. However, shares trade for $0.0049 cents a pop, so this is only for the risk-tolerant. GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH)Source: Shutterstock On a surface level, GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:GWPH) brings a lot of positives to the table. As pioneers among medicinally-concentrated marijuana stocks, they lever substantial credibility.Their Sativex drug for addressing symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis achieved better-than-expected results. This only encourages other companies to pursue cannabis-based therapies for many other diseases.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Avoid for the Holidays As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- AbbVie Inc. sold $30 billion of bonds to help finance its acquisition of Allergan Plc as investors flocked to buy a piece of the largest debt sale this year. Demand for the notes was strong with the order book peaking at $77 billion.The drug maker capitalized on some of the cheapest borrowing costs of the year, with risk premiums over Treasuries at the lowest level since October 2018. That should encourage more borrowers to come forward, with investment-grade syndicate desks projecting another $17 billion in sales this week on top of AbbVie’s expected offering.Read more: IG ANALYSIS: AbbVie Prints $30b Through Curve; $73b Final BookAbbVie’s sale tops the chart as the biggest bond sale this year and it’s the fourth largest of all time. The offering came in 10 parts with the 30-year security yielding 1.90 percentage points above Treasuries, after initially discussing around 2.1 percentage points, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. Investors placed about $77 billion in orders, people familiar with the order book said.AbbVie agreed to buy Allergan in June for $63 billion in one of the largest pharmaceutical deals this year. It should bring much-needed diversity to the acquirer’s line-up, as AbbVie’s cornerstone drug Humira, which treats arthritis, has been facing more competition, especially in Europe. U.S. antitrust officials are still reviewing the deal, which the companies expect will close early next year.The deal is expected to take the combined company’s debt to more than three times a measure of its earnings, credit raters have said. Still, Moody’s Investors Service has left its rating on AbbVie unchanged at two levels above speculative grade, as the transaction should generate significant free cash flow. S&P Global Ratings, however, said it will likely cut AbbVie one level to BBB+, three levels above junk.Read more: Corporations Pile Into Bond Market as Borrowing Costs DropManagement has reiterated its intention to pay down debt, to achieve a ratio of net debt to Ebitda -- earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization -- of 2.5 times by the end of 2021.

2019-11-12,"(Bloomberg) -- Floodgates have opened in the corporate bond market as issuers capitalize on some of the cheapest funding costs of the year.Credit risk premiums have been tightening as investors pour money into corporate bond funds. That’s encouraging companies to borrow, with AbbVie Inc. looking to price the year’s largest sale Tuesday, and at least 10 new deals in the junk-bond market.It all adds to a bullish outlook as recession fears have abated amid stronger economic data and progress in U.S.-China trade talks, Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Hans Mikkelsen said in a report Friday. Investors expect spreads to tighten further in the next three months, but could widen over the longer-term, the strategists said, citing a November survey.With that in mind, issuers are looking to get in now while the getting’s good. Since the Federal Reserve lowered rates for a third consecutive time last month, Treasury yields have been rising as investors perceive the cutting to be done for now. Companies may be concerned that rates are only rising from here, said Ken Monaghan, co-director of high yield at Amundi Pioneer.And with most of third-quarter earnings done, and largely better than feared, equity markets have been supportive for corporate spreads, said Nicholas Elfner, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors.“That gives you comfort that the market is relatively healthy,” Elfner said. “There’s still good demand out there for high quality names.”Investment-grade spreads are hovering at 105 basis points over Treasuries, the lowest level since October 2018. High-yield premiums meanwhile came in 16 basis points last week alone, and should rally further alongside rising stocks and oil prices. High-grade funds have seen inflows in all but one of the last 23 weeks, and high-yield funds, with the exception of a small outflow last week, had drawn in money in the three prior weeks, according to Refinitiv Lipper.AbbVie is borrowing $30 billion to help fund its purchase of Allergan Plc -- which could catapult this week’s high-grade sales to $45 billion, double last week’s total. High-yield issuers, most of which are refinancing debt, are contributing to what will the busiest day for supply in three months.“As the cost of debt remains low, you’ll see issuers rush to beat the holiday slowdown and join the party to issue,” said Lon Erickson, a portfolio manager from Thornburg Investment Management.(Updates with AbbVie deal size in the penultimate paragraph)&#92;--With assistance from Natalie Harrison and Elizabeth Rembert.To contact the reporter on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Christopher DeRezaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Corporations Pile Into Bond Market as Borrowing Costs Drop

2019-11-13,"On Oct. 15, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), the healthcare giant, reported Q3 earnings and revenue that beat analysts' average expectations. Yet, over the past 12 months, JNJ stock is down about 9%.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com Now many investors are wondering whether the company may end the year on a high note. In the next few weeks, I expect Johnson & Johnson shares to trade mostly between a range of $125 and $135. Long-term investors may view any upcoming weakness in the JNJ stock price as an opportunity to buy the shares.  Analyzing JNJ's Recent EarningsWith a market cap of $347 billion, Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare giant, is currently number 37 on the Fortune 500 list. JNJ 's third-quarter revenue rose 1.9% year-over-year to $20.7 billion. Its earnings per share, excluding certain items, came in at $2.12, versus analysts' average estimate of $2.01.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Tech Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2019 The company has a broad-based business model with a global reach. It operates in three segments that provide it with diversified sources of revenue, earnings and cash flow:  * Pharmaceutical, which contributes more than 50% of JNJ's pretax profits  * Consumer  * Medical DevicesJNJ's pharmaceutical division markets treatments for immunology, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, pulmonary hypertension, infectious diseases and cancer.Several of its well-known consumer brands include Aveeno, Band-Aid, Johnson's Baby, Listerine, Neutrogena, Rogaine, Tylenol and Zyrtec.Finally,its medical devices business develops and markets products and solutions for surgery, orthopedics, and vision.Although about 60% of Johnson &Johnson's revenue is U.S.-based, its overseas operations in general and its emerging market businesses in particular are proving to be important growth catalysts for JNJ. The Legal Woes of Johnson & JohnsonPharmaceutical industry firms often face legal challenges. At present, Johnson & Johnson is facing literally thousands of lawsuits.For example, in the summer, the Federal Trade Commission issued civil subpoenas to the company in an effort to determine whether JNJ had violated antitrust laws with Remicade, its rheumatoid arthritis drug.In August,  Johnson and Johnson made the news when an Oklahoma judge found  it guilty of  helping to fuel the state's opioid crisis by aggressively marketing painkillers. JNJ is also facing various lawsuits regarding its talc-based baby powder.Recent research by  Theresa Gabaldon of George Washington University Law School discusses in detail the &quot;ballooning of pharmaceutical advertising with correlative increases in the prescriptions written for various mental and other ailments&quot; within the industry.Professor Gabaldon further states that &quot;Purdue Pharma led off in the 1990s by heavily advertising OxyContin as non-addictive--a claim that clearly was untrue.&quot; AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) &quot;also conducted aggressive advertising campaigns for their proprietary opioids. These campaigns, which were directed at physicians, resulted in $11 billion from opioid sales alone in 2010.&quot;In the long-run, lawsuits and fines do not necessarily dent the fundamental metrics of pharma companies much. However, in the short-term, investors understandably get spooked by the uncertainty created by lawsuits. Other Long-Term Factors to ConsiderOne of the challenges faced by JNJ and other drug companies is falling sales as the patents of blockbuster drugs expire,  enabling much cheaper, competing generic drugs to be sold.Therefore, the pressure to innovate and diversify is part of the reality of managing a global pharma leader like Johnson & Johnson. And in JNJ's case, diversification has been the  company's competitive advantage. As one segment faces headwinds, the others usually help propel the company forward.The forward price-earnings ratio of JNJ stock stands at 14.5 and is lower than many of its peers. Many investors would cbe comfortable paying more than that for a strong business like Johnson & Johnson.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson stock also has a dividend yield of 2.9%. The conglomerate has raised its dividend each year for over half a century. And dividends tend to create a &quot;price floor&quot; for coveted stocks such as JNJ. What Technical Charts IndicateNo investor has a crystal ball that can predict the markets' next move. However, analyzing the recent price action of JNJ stock may give us an indication of what to expect in the weeks ahead.In 2019 JNJ stock has fallen 1.6%. Its 52-week range has been $121.00 (Dec. 24, 2018) - $148.99 (Dec. 4, 2018).JNJ's short-term charts are painting a mixed picture and suggest that  JNJ stock is likely to trade within a range. While long-term investors would like to see JNJ stock stay over $135, short-term traders are likely to keep the shares between $125 and $135.I do not expect Johnson & Johnson stock to reach any new highs until we have more clarity on the full ramification of several of its legal challenges.In recent weeks, the stock has found support around the $125 level. Therefore, I'd consider buying the shares if they fall toward or even below first $125 and then $120. The Bottom Line on JNJ StockThe company's diversification enables JNJ stock to withstand economic cycles more effectively. No matter what the economy does, consumers will buy the products of many of its strong brands, and Johnson & Johnson will likely have industry-leading market share in many areas.I remain bullish on the long-term outlook of Johnson and Johnson stock. However, in the short-term, JNJ might exhibit weakness.Therefore, investors may consider staying on the sidelines on JNJ if they do not currently have a position in the shares.Alternatively, investors who already own the shares may  consider hedging their positions. As for hedging strategies, covered calls with a Jan. 17 expiry could be appropriate.Finally, any short-term decline in these shares may create  better entry points for long-term investors who do not yet own JNJ stock.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil hold PFE covered calls (Nov. 15 expiry).

2019-11-27,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribe to our podcast.Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson’s Tories of risking the National Health Service in secret talks with the U.S. as he sought to shift the election campaign away from allegations of antisemitism. Johnson denied the U.K.’s free-to-use health care system is up for sale after the Labour leader unveiled previously redacted documents about negotiations.Time is running out for Corbyn to claw back Johnson’s lead ahead of the Dec. 12 general election; a closely watched YouGov poll tonight will provide an indicator of how realistic that is. Dominic Cummings, the premier’s senior adviser, published a blog warning of the “very real possibility” of a hung Parliament as he sought to keep Brexit supporters focused on backing the Tories.Read More: Corbyn Accuses U.K. Tories of Secret NHS Talks With the U.S.The Context: Never Mind Brexit, U.K. Vote Hinges on Future of the NHSELEC for more on the U.K. electionKey Developments:Corbyn’s reveals documents showing six rounds of talks over U.S. trade deal, which he says shows the NHS is “up for sale”YouGov releases MRP poll at 10 p.m. In 2017, it correctly predicted the Conservatives losing their majorityJohnson is campaigning in Cornwall as the Tories pledge to improve mobile phone coverageLiberal Democrats call for gig economy workers on zero-hours contracts to get a 20% higher minimum wageScottish National Party unveils manifesto to “protect Scotland from Boris Johnson”Johnson’s Conservatives have about a 69% chance of a majority in Parliament, according to odds from bookmaker Paddy PowerJohnson’s Top Aide Says Hung Parliament Possible (5:20 p.m.)Boris Johnson’s senior Downing Street adviser appealed to Brexit-supporting voters to help deliver a Conservative majority on Dec. 12 and warned that, despite polls showing big a Tory lead, “things are MUCH tighter than they seem and there is a very real possibility of a hung parliament.”Writing on his blog, Cummings sought to win the backing of Vote Leave supporters who aren’t natural Tories by saying he too had never been part of a political party when he started working in Johnson’s office in July.He urged voters to talk face-to-face to friends and family and tell them a vote for any party except the Tories would lead to a Labour-SNP alliance in government. The referendum that would be offered as a result would be “effectively Remain or Remain,” he wrote.“Without a majority, the nightmare continues,” he said in his intervention, published as voters start casting postal ballots. “ALL other MPs will gang together to stop Brexit and give EU citizens the vote. It’s that simple.”Remainers Urged to Vote Tactically (3 p.m.)Boris Johnson’s Tory Party is on course to win 366 seats on Dec. 12, giving him a majority of 41, according to new data released by anti-Brexit group Best for Britain.The group used MRP data to assess the outlook since Nigel Farage announced his Brexit Party won’t stand in seats won by the Conservatives in 2017.What Is the ‘MRP Poll’ and Can It Predict the U.K. Election?Best for Britain said there are 165 districts where the margin of victory is fewer than 5,000 votes, and urged pro-EU voters in these seats to vote tactically to prevent a pro-Brexit party winning.“Even with the Brexit Party collapse, there are still lots of seats in play for Remainers,” said Naomi Smith, the group’s chief executive. “This is crucial as it means they could be won by pro-EU parties if voters hold their nose and vote for the party with the best shot of beating the Tories.”Separately, favorability ratings for Jo Swinson, leader of the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats, have “fallen sharply in the past week,” an Ipsos Mori poll showed.Archbishop Raps Tories Over Twitter Deception (2 p.m.)Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby criticized Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party for masquerading as a fact-checking organization on Twitter during his debate with Jeremy Corbyn last week.“Where something like that is done, where there is a misleading use of facts, deliberately, that is wrong,” he told the BBC. “We have to have an enormously high value on truth.”He also repeated his support for Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, who on Tuesday attacked Corbyn over antisemitism in the Labour Party. Welby said he knows Mirvis well, and it was “one of the most painful decisions he’s ever had to take, and I know that’s true. His instincts, like mine and others, are that during an election, you keep schtum, you say nothing,” Welby said. “He felt there was no choice.”Johnson Vows Zero-Tolerance on Prejudice (1 p.m.)Boris Johnson vowed to take a zero-tolerance approach to racism in his Conservative Party and apologized for any offense caused by incidents involving its members.“Whenever we have an incident of antisemitism or Islamophobia or whatever in the Conservative Party, we take a zero-tolerance approach,” the premier told broadcasters. “We have a one bounce and we deal with it approach to this.”He said there will be “an independent inquiry into Islamophobia, antisemitism, every manner of prejudice and discrimination and it will start before Christmas.”With the Labour party facing accusation about antisemitism , the Tories have been charged with Islamophobia. Johnson himself once described Muslim women who wear burkas as looking like “letterboxes” and “bank robbers.”Asked if he apologized for the Islamophobia that has taken place in his party, he replied “look, of course. And for all the hurt and offense that has been caused, of course we do. All that is intolerable.” He wasn’t asked specifically about his own remarks.Johnson Denies NHS Sell-Off Plan (12:20 p.m.)Boris Johnson responded to Jeremy Corbyn’s publication of documents about trade talks with the U.S. (see 10:15 a.m.) with a denial that the NHS will be part of any agreement.“We are absolutely resolved there will be no sale of the NHS, no privatization,” he said in a pooled TV interview while campaigning in Cornwall. “The NHS is not on the table in any way. The NHS is in no way on the table, in no aspect whatever.”The prime minister accused Corbyn of trying to change the focus of the campaign. “It’s continually brought up by the Labour Party as a diversionary tactic from the difficulties they are encountering, particularly over the problem about leadership on antisemitism and then the great vacuity about their policy on Brexit,” Johnson said.Sturgeon: SNP Can ‘Pressure’ Corbyn (12 p.m.)Nicola Sturgeon likened the choice her Scottish National Party may face between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn in the event of a hung Parliament to picking the “devil or the deep blue sea,” but said despite her misgivings about the Labour leader, his party had far more in common with her social and economic agenda. She ruled out supporting the Conservatives.Following her speech in Glasgow, Sturgeon was asked if she would back Corbyn despite the warning from the U.K.’s chief rabbi this week that the Labour leader is unfit for high office. She criticized Corbyn’s failure to eradicate antisemitism from Labour’s ranks, but pointed out that there are other issues the SNP would also have to consider -- including the path to a second referendum on Scottish independence and stopping Brexit.“We would be very clear with our expectations to any party leader who wanted the support of the SNP to make clear its zero tolerance approach to antisemitism, to Islamophobia, to any form of prejudice or racism,” Sturgeon said. “I think, to those worried about Jeremy Corbyn, it should give a degree of reassurance that SNP MPs, with the right values and approach on these issues, can apply that pressure.”Corbyn’s Key Claims on U.S.-U.K. Negotiations (11 a.m.)Jeremy Corbyn accused the Conservative government of concealing secret negotiations between U.K. and U.S. officials on the future of the NHS in any trade deal. These are the key allegations:U.S. pharmaceutical companies want to force up the price the NHS pays for drugs as part of a U.S.-U.K. Trade deal, he said, noting that Donald Trump regularly complains about the “unreasonably low prices” other countries pay for medicinesThe documents show both sides have finished initial discussions on lengthening patents for medicines in the U.K., Corbyn saidHe said this would mean the U.K. paying U.S. levels for many drugs. He gave the example of AbbVie Inc.’s Humira -- a drug for the treatment of Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis -- which he said costs the NHS 1,409 pounds ($1,815) a packet, compared to 8,115 pounds ($10,450) in the U.S.He said U.K. officials conceded “NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration” in talks, and they are entering a “very advanced stage”Corbyn: Party Has Apologized For Antisemitism (10:40 a.m.)Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn did not directly say sorry when pressed again on his handling of cases of antisemitism, after he missed several opportunities to apologize in a BBC interview on Tuesday night.“I made it very clear antisemitism is completely wrong in our society,” he said. “Our party did make it clear when I was elected leader, and after, that antisemitism is unacceptable in any form in our party or society and did indeed offer its sympathies and apologies to those that had suffered.”He also said “a very large numbers of other people in the Jewish community do support Labour, do recognize my absolute commitment that every community in our country will be safe under a Labour government.”Corbyn Plays on Trump Fears (10:20 a.m.)Jeremy Corbyn’s speech was heavily infused with the name of the Donald Trump, as he sought to capitalize on Britons’ suspicions of the U.S. president.The document Corbyn referred to (see 10:15 a.m.) includes accounts of trade meetings between U.S. and U.K. officials. He said the account of one meeting showed U.S. officials refusing to include reference to climate change in the trade discussions.“This is not only a plot against our NHS, it’s a plot against our country,” Corbyn said. “What’s at stake in a deal with Trump could not be more important for the country.”“These documents confirm the U.S. Is demanding the NHS is on the table in the trade talks,” Corbyn said. “Big pharma has ripped off and imperiled the health of the American people for years. Now these secret reports show they’re looking to do the same to us if the conservatives are elected on Dec. 12”Corbyn: Secret U.S. Talks Put NHS in Danger (10:15 a.m.)Jeremy Corbyn sought to turn attention to the fate of the National Health Service after his party was hammered over its record on antisemitism.At an event in London, he held up a 451-page unredacted document, which he said showed information Boris Johnson’s government wouldn’t reveal about the status of health care in U.S. trade talks. He said the secret document -- previously only available in a heavily redacted form -- showed that under Johnson, “the NHS is up for sale” in trade talks with the U.S.. The premier’s denials that it isn’t are “in tatters,” he said.The presentation was preceded by a video clip that included U.S. President Donald Trump saying that everything was on the table in trade talks.“This election is now a fight for the survival of our National Health Service,” Corbyn said. “Labour will never ever treat the NHS as a bargaining chip in trade talks with anybody. We will never let Donald Trump get his hands on our NHS.”“Labour will not rest, because unlike the Conservatives we’re not on the side of the billionaires and the bankers. We’re on the side of the nurse, the doctor, the patient and the people, and we will never sell out our national health service.”SNP Manifesto to ‘Protect Scotland’ From Johnson (10 a.m.)The Scottish National Party will unveil its manifesto at an event in Glasgow -- the last major party to do so -- with a pledge to “protect Scotland from Boris Johnson” and a warning there is “much worse to come” if Brexit goes ahead.“A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit and put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands -- not Boris Johnson’s,” SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will say, according to speech excerpts released by the party. “The future of our country is on the line.​”With the SNP holding a significant poll lead in Scotland, a key question is what the party will do in the event of a hung Parliament on Dec. 12. The SNP’s signature policy is a second referendum on Scottish independence, but more funding for the National Health Service is also a priority.Burgon: Labour ‘Sorry’ for Hurt Over Antisemitism (Earlier)Labour’s justice spokesman Richard Burgon said his party is “sorry for the hurt caused” over its handling of cases of antisemitism, after leader Jeremy Corbyn struggled to explain his strategy and missed several opportunities to apologize in a BBC interview on Tuesday night.“Jeremy has apologized on a number of occasions and said that he’s sorry for the very real hurt felt by people in the Jewish community,” Burgon told the BBC. “On a number of occasions last summer for example, he has made those statements and it’s right that he did.”The latest row over antisemitism in the Labour Party was triggered by the U.K.’s Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, who suggested this week Corbyn is unfit for high office and said Labour can “no longer claim to be the party of equality and anti-racism.”Jenrick: Tory Islamophobia Probe Will Be ‘Thorough’ (Earlier)Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick insisted the Conservatives will conduct a “thorough” investigation into discrimination and prejudice in the party, after the Muslim Council of Britain criticized Boris Johnson’s Tories over their handling of Islamophobia in their ranks.“I want to see by the end of this year, as the Prime Minister’s promised, a thorough review of prejudice and racism and discrimination within the party,” Jenrick told the BBC. “We want to be a party that has no tolerance whatsoever of racism, prejudice or discrimination of any kind.”Just as Labour has failed to shake off accusations of antisemitism in the party, the Tories are struggling to overcome charges of Islamophobia, exacerbated by Johnson in a 2018 newspaper column in which he said Muslim women who wear burqas look like “letter boxes.”Earlier:Corbyn Can’t Find Antidote to Anti-Semitic ‘Poison’ in LabourU.K. Car-makers Warn Against Flimsy EU Trade Deal After BrexitWhat Is the ‘MRP Poll’ and Can It Predict the U.K. Election?Corbyn Struggles With Anti-Semitism Claims: U.K. Campaign Trail&#92;--With assistance from Robert Hutton and Jessica Shankleman.To contact the reporters on this story: Alex Morales in London at amorales2@bloomberg.net;Greg Ritchie in London at gritchie10@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Stuart Biggs, Thomas PennyFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",Johnson Adviser Warns of Chance of Hung Parliament: U.K. Votes

2019-12-13,"When writing this article, I was looking for an ideal list of dividend-paying stocks that consistently raise their dividends each year. In addition, the dividend yields have to be higher than average. I used a cutoff of 4 to 6% dividend yield.This is much higher than the S&P 500, with its dividend yield of 1.8%. So picking these stocks has a good chance of appreciation.The stocks also have to be cheap. The price-to-earnings ratio hurdle to make my list is 11 times or lower. This is significantly lower than most stocks trading today. For example, the S&P 500 P/E ratio is 23.8 times earnings. On a forward basis, it is slightly below 20x. So my cutoff is almost 50% to 60% of the market average.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * The 10 Worst Dividend Stocks of the Decade Lastly, the company has to be able to afford the dividends. Earnings per share must be higher than the dividend per share.Even with as strict as all that may sound, I still found five stocks that met these criteria in spades. You might consider investing in them. Dividend Stocks to Buy: AT&T (T)Dividend Yield: 5.3%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 10.8xAverage Dividend Growth Over 5 Years: 2%Source: Mark R. Hake AT&T (NYSE:T) has consistently raised its dividends to shareholders each year. You can see this in the chart I prepared, at right. Dividends per share are growing consistently by 2% or higher each year over the past three to five years.In addition, AT&T is very cheap compared to its earnings per share. The P/E ratio is below 11x.AT&T purchased Time Warner a little over a year ago and is still in the process of integrating the company. Analysts expect earnings to grow by 2.2% in 2020. Moreover, this is also the same amount by which dividends are expected to grow next year.T stock is expected to begin buying back shares on a larger scale.  I recently wrote an article about this which you can read here. Moreover, earnings cover T stock dividend very well. The $2.05 dividend rate represents just 57% of its expected $3.55 earnings per share. AbbVie (ABBV)Dividend Yield: 5.3%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 9.9xAverage Dividend Growth Over 5 years: 21%AbbVie is a $128 billion market value drug manufacturing company. It has consistently raised its dividend over the past five years. You can see this in the chart I have prepared. On average dividends have increased by 21% per year.Source: Mark R. Hake In addition, ABBV stock is very cheap. For example, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) stock trades for less than 10 times earnings. In 2020, expected earnings of $9.91 per share put ABBV stock at a P/E of 8.75 times.Abbie made a cash and stock bid for Allergan (NYSE:AGN) in late June 2019. AGN is a $61 billion market cap U.K./U.S. drug company. The deal is expected to close in early 2020. AbbVie claims the deal will significantly increase shareholder value.As it stands, the dividend per share for ABBV stock is well covered by its earnings. The annual $4.72 dividend per share represents just 53% of expected earnings of $8.93 per share.  * 7 Sinfully Good Casino Stocks That Could Win the Jackpot in 2020 In sum, ABBV stock looks like a good cheap, high-yield and consistent dividend-paying stock worth buying. Dividend Stocks to Buy: Harley-Davidson (HOG)Dividend Yield: 3.9%Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 11.6xAverage Dividend Growth Over 5 Years: 11.99%Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) stock has a very nice dividend yield of 3.9%.  The company has had a rough few years from EU and China tariffs. Nevertheless, HOG has paid consistently higher dividends, as can be seen in the chart. Its average dividend growth has been 12% over the past five years.Source: Mark R. Hake HOG stock presently trades on 11.6 times earnings. The company is experiencing lower earnings from the tariffs and lower bike sales as a result. Nevertheless, it has reduced its costs. Revenue next year is expected to be slightly higher than this year.Earnings for 2020 are expected to be $3.55 per share by analysts covered by Seeking Alpha. That puts HOG stock at less than 11x earnings.The dividend per share of $1.50 is well covered by expected earnings. Once the tariffs are lifted, HOG stock has a good chance of increasing earnings and dividends dramatically.Meanwhile, the dividend yield of almost 4% is a good inducement for investors to wait for things to turn around for Harley-Davidson. International Business Machines (IBM)Dividend Yield: 4.8%Price-to-Earnings: 10.6xAverage Dividend Growth 5 Years: 10.91%IBM has consistently raised its dividend per share over the past 5 years. Its average dividend growth has been stellar at 10.9%. You can see this in the chart at the right.Source: Mark R. Hake In addition, IBM is very cheap. It trades at just 10.6 times earnings. In 2020 EPS is expected to be $13.31 per share, according to Seeking Alpha. This puts IBM stock on just 10x forward earnings.Moreover, IBM's $6.48 dividend per share is just over 50% of the EPS of $12.80 or so expected this year. As a result, you can see the earnings well cover the dividend.I have written several articles on IBM and its push into the hybrid cloud space now that it fully owns Red Hat. IBM paid $34 billion for that acquisition, which closed in early July 2019. IBN believes the hybrid cloud market represents a $1.2 trillion opportunity over the next decade. Most companies will need to move their operations onto the cloud over that period.  * 7 Earnings Reports to Watch Next Week This bodes well for IBM over the long run. With its 4.8% dividend yield, IBM stock will pay investors to investors to wait for earnings to take advantage of the expected spike from hybrid cloud growth. Kohl's Corp (KSS)Dividend Yield: 5.5%Price-to-Earnings: 10.3xAverage Dividend Growth 5 Years: 11.4%Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), the department store chain, can catch your eye with a very nice dividend yield of 5.5%. Moreover, KSS has increased its dividend annually on average 11.4% over the past five years.EPS is expected to be $4.77 this year. Therefore KSS's earnings well cover the dividends. Dividends take up just 56% of earnings. In addition, next year EPS is expected to be roughly flat with this year, according to Seeking Alpha.KSS stock trades for about 10 times earnings. KSS stock is very cheap at these prices. For example, several reasons for this relate to tariff headwinds and customers' increasing preference to shop online. Its recent deal to take in Amazon returns will help drive traffic to its physical stores.I believe that Kohl's will be a winner in the omnichannel sales space.  At this price, which is very cheap, the dividend pays investors very well to wait for the company to grow earnings.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2019-12-24,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For all the flak the pharmaceutical industry has taken for its exorbitant pricing practices,  there's no getting around the fact that it's been a pretty stunning decade for medical progress.Multiple new categories of medicines have moved from dreams and lab benches into the market and people’s lives, and investors who came along for the ride often reaped extraordinary profits. The Nasdaq Biotech Index is up 360% over the last 10 years to the S&P 500's 190%. And that’s without mentioning the hundreds of billions of dollars in takeovers that rewarded shareholders with windfalls.  As 2020 approaches, it's worth highlighting how far we've come in the past 10 years in developing new therapies and approaches to treating disease, even as politicians grapple with how to rein in health-care costs without breaking an ecosystem that incentivizes the search for new discoveries. Here are some of the decade’s biggest medical breakthroughs:Cell therapies:  First approved in the U.S. two years ago, these treatments still sound like science fiction. Drugmakers harvest immune cells from patients, engineer them to hunt tumors, grow them by the millions into a living drug, and reinfuse them. Yescarta from Gilead Siences Inc. and Novartis AG’s Kymriah — the two treatments approved so far — can put patients with deadly blood cancers into remission in some cases. At the beginning of the decade, academics were just beginning early patient tests.  It’s still early days for the technology, and some issues are holding these drugs back. There are significant side effects, and the bespoke manufacturing process is expensive and time-consuming. That has contributed to a bruising price tag:  Both of the approved medicines cost over $350,000 for a single treatment. And for now, cell therapy is mostly limited to very sick patients who have exhausted all other alternatives. Luckily, more options are on their way. Some drugmakers are focused on different types of blood cancers. Others hope to mitigate side effects or create treatments that can be grown from donor cells to reduce expenses and speed up treatment. In the longer run, companies are targeting trickier solid tumors. Scientists wouldn't be looking so far into the future without this decade’s extraordinary progress. Gene therapies:  Researchers have spent years trying to figure out how to replace faulty DNA to cure genetic diseases, potentially with as little as one treatment. Scientific slip-ups and safety issues derailed a wave of initial excitement about these  therapies starting in the 1990s; the first two such treatments to be approved in Europe turned out to be commercial flops. This decade, the technology has come of age. Luxturna, a treatment developed by Spark Therapeutics Inc. for a rare eye disease, became the first gene therapy to get U.S. approval in late 2017. Then in May came the approval of Novartis AG’s Zolgensma for a deadly muscle-wasting disease. The drugs have the potential to stave off blindness and death or significant disability with a single dose, and,  unsurprisingly, Big Pharma has given them a substantial financial endorsement. Roche Holding AG paid $4.7 billion to acquire Spark this year, while Novartis spent $8.7 billion in 2018 to buy Zolgensma developer Avexis Inc. Dozens of additional therapies are in development for a variety of other conditions and should hit the market in the next few years. They offer the tantalizing potential not just to cure diseases, but to replace years of wildly expensive alternative treatment. If drugmakers can resist the temptation to squeeze out every ounce of value by doing things like charging $2.1 million for Zolgensma,  there’s potential for these treatments to save both lives and money. RNA revolution: The above treatments modify DNA; this group uses the body’s messaging system to turn a patient’s cells into a drug factory or interrupt a harmful process. Two scientists won a Nobel Prize in 2006 for discoveries related to RNA interference (RNAi), one approach to making this type of drug, showing its potential to treat difficult diseases. That prompted an enormous amount of hype and investment, but a series of clinical failures and safety issues led large drugmakers to give up on the approach. Sticking with it into this decade paid off.Alnylam Inc. has been working since 2002 to figure out the thorny problems plaguing this class of treatments. It brought two RNAi drugs for rare diseases to the market in the past two years and has more on the way. The technology is also moving from small markets to larger ones: Novartis just paid $9.7 billion to acquire Medicines Co. for its Alnylam-developed drug that can substantially lower cholesterol with two annual treatments.Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Biogen Inc. collaborated on Spinraza, a so-called antisense drug that became the first effective treatment for a deadly rare disease. It was approved in late 2016 and had one of the most impressive drug launches of the decade. And Moderna Therapeutics rode a wave of promising messenger RNA-based medicines to the most lucrative biotechnology IPO of all time in 2018. From pharma abandonment to multiple approvals and blockbuster sales potential in under 10 years. Not bad! Cancer immunotherapy: Scientists had been working on ways to unleash the human immune system on cancers well before the 2010s without much luck. Checkpoint inhibitors — drugs that release the brakes on the body's defense mechanisms —  have since produced outstanding results in a variety of cancers and are the decade’s most lucrative turnaround story. Merck got a hold of Keytruda via its 2009 acquisition of Schering-Plough, but it was far from the focus of that deal. Once Bristol-Myers Squibb & Co. produced promising results for its similar drug, Opdivo, Merck started a smart development plan that has turned Keytruda into the world’s most valuable cancer medicine. It’s now available to treat more than 10 types of the disease, and has five direct competitors in the U.S. alone. Analysts expect the category to exceed $25 billion in sales next year.If anything, the drugs may have been too successful. Copycat efforts are pulling money that could fund more innovative research. There are thousands of trials underway attempting to extend the reach of these medicines by combining them with other drugs. Some are based more on wishful thinking than firm scientific footing. Still, the ability to shrink some previously intractable tumors is a considerable advance. If drugmakers finally figure out the right combinations and competition creates pricing pressure that boosts access, these medicines will do even more in the years to come. Conquering  hepatitis C: From a combined economic and public-health standpoint, a new group of highly effective hepatitis C medicines may outstrip just about anything else on this list so far. Cure rates for earlier treatments weren’t especially high; they took some time to work and had nasty side effects. The approval of Gilead’s Sovaldi in 2013, followed in time by successor drugs such as AbbVie Inc.’s Mavyret, have made hepatitis C pretty easily curable in a matter of weeks. For Gilead, getting to market rapidly with its drug proved enormously profitable; it raked in over $40 billion in revenue in just three years. Hepatitis C causes liver damage over time that can lead to transplants or cancer. The existence of a rapid cure is a significant long-term boon even if the initial pricing on the drugs made them, in some cases, prohibitively expensive. Sovaldi notoriously cost $1,000 per pill at launch and over $80,000 for a course of treatment. The good new is, treatments have become a lot more affordable, which should allow this class of drugs to have a broad and lasting positive health impact.Hepatitis C is one of the relatively few markets where the drug-pricing system has worked well. As competing medicines hit the market, the effective cost of these treatments plummeted. That, in turn, made the drugs more accessible to state Medicaid programs and prison systems, which operate on tight budgets and care for populations with higher rates of hepatitis C infection. Louisiana has pioneered the use of a “Netflix model,” under which the state paid an upfront fee for unlimited access to the drug. It’s an arrangement that will help cure thousands of patients, and other states are likely to follow its lead.Many of the medicines highlighted in this column have list prices in the six figures, a trend that’s helped drive up America’s drug spending by more than $100 billion since 2009. Building on this decade’s medical advances is going to lead to even more effective medicines that will likely come with steeper prices. I’d like to hope that policymakers will come up with a solution that better balances the need to reward innovation with the need to keep medicines accessible. That would really be a breakthrough.To contact the author of this story: Max Nisen at mnisen@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Beth Williams at bewilliams@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Max Nisen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering biotech, pharma and health care.

2020-01-08,"Shares of AbbVie Inc.  and Allergan plc  were both up about 1% in trading on Wednesday after AbbVie announced new plans for the combined company once the pending $63 billion acquisition of Allergan closes. It's the first time the company has shared leadership plans since confirming that Richard Gonzalez would stay in his role as CEO of AbbVie. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders will be on the board of directors but does not have a role in the combined company, according to an AbbVie spokeswoman. One Allergan executive, Carrie Strom, will join the executive leadership team of the combined company; the other eight members are AbbVie executives. Strom will lead the newly created Allergan Aesthetics, a separate Irvine, Calif.-based business for Botox and the other Allergan medical aesthetics treatments. It will also conduct its own research and development. Allergan's other therapies, including Botox for indications other than aesthetics, the antipsychotic Vraylar and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, will be folded into AbbVie, which is based in North Chicago. The deal is expected to close this quarter. Over the last year, Allergan's stock is up 31%, and AbbVie's stock is down 1%.

2020-01-10,"There has been a great deal of discussion about how drug prices will change in coming years. The fact that this is an election year surely sticks in traders' minds. If you remember back to the 2016 election cycle, biotech shares went into a brutal downturn after Hillary Clinton castigated the pharma industry for its pricing practices. Shares of healthcare stocks eventually recovered as it became clear that the Trump Administration had bigger fish to fry than going after drug prices.But now the cycle has begun again. Several Democratic candidates are proposing dramatic changes to the American healthcare industry to try to curb runaway drug prices. It seems likely that if re-elected, President Trump would probably need to tackle the issue again as well, as the system left in place from the Affordable Care Act needs modifications. This is a problem for investors. It's hard to forecast future profits when it's not clear what the playing field will look like within a couple years.  * 7 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Set for Growth As such, it's a good time to take stock of your personal exposure to the healthcare industry before the presidential election heats up and potential market-moving headlines start pouring in. To that end, in general, companies with diversified revenue streams will fare better, while ones relying on a few high-priced drugs face more risk. Here are the outlooks for seven leading biotech, pharma and healthcare stocks in light of the potential pressures on drug prices going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Healthcare Stocks to Watch: Amarin (AMRN)Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com Amarin (NASDAQ:AMRN) offers a great example of the questions around drug pricing going forward. It recently scored Food and Drug Administration approval to market its fish oil product, Vascepa, to a much wider range of adults with high triglycerides. That should be a huge win for Amarin, right? The stock initially popped to multi-year highs, but slumped back to prior levels quickly.This week, Amarin stock dropped even farther, and it's now down 25% from its recent highs. The latest catalyst is that leading health insurance firm UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) reportedly dropped Amarin's Vascepa from its preferred authorization list. UnitedHealth offers Lovaza, the fish oil product initially commercialized by GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), instead. Lovaza also aims to improve heart condition outcomes by lowering triglycerides. Unlike Vascepa, however, Lovaza doesn't have such a wide body of clinical trials supporting its efficacy.Nonetheless, insurance companies like UnitedHealth might think that one fish oil product is similar to another, and may pick the cheaper one for its customers. It shows the difficulty pharma companies are having as more attention turns to price. With increased attention to drug prices from both the private sector and the government, companies that offer a slightly better version of an existing drug should be careful.Amarin is a great example of how FDA approval doesn't necessarily translate into strong demand or profits in the current economic environment. AMRN stock still has plenty of potential upside, particularly in a buyout scenario. But it isn't the slam dunk winner it might have been five or ten years ago. Novo Nordisk (NVO)Source: joreks / Shutterstock.com Unlike the previous example, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) has a safer route to profits in this regulatory environment. That is to produce drugs that are clearly best-in-class, and sell lots of them at affordable prices. Novo Nordisk does this by selling insulin and other diabetes treatments.Given the growing diabetes epidemic around the world, Novo Nordisk is riding a huge demographic tide. And it's significantly harder for health insurers to say no to Novo Nordisk with its vitally important medications. Novo stock has traded up recently; however, it's still at a reasonable 21x forward earnings given its historic near-double digit earnings-per-share growth rate.  * 7 Low-Risk Mutual Funds to Buy Now On top of that, Novo Nordisk stock is still only trading at where it previously peaked back in 2015. While earnings and dividends have grown nicely over the past five years, the company's stock hasn't yet caught up to its recent growth. Once the stock breaks out over $60 and hits all-time highs, however, it should pick up more momentum. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com One way to lower your political risk, as it comes to drug prices is to run a supremely diversified business. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) manages to do that by having three different operations within the parent corporation. These include consumer products, medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs.Consumer products generally don't fall under the FDA's purview and aren't hurt by pressure on drug prices. Insurance efforts to crack down healthcare pricing could hurt medical device margins, but it's a bit of a different animal than drugs.J&J still has drug pricing exposure to be certain, pharmaceuticals are its large division by a wide margin when it comes to profit. But the two other embedded lines of business lower risk; meanwhile, J&J's drug portfolio is one of the most broadly diversified ones out there. JNJ stock has traded up a bit recently, but it's still selling for just 16x forward earnings. Combine that with its unparalleled record of dividend growth, and J&J is a conservative way to get your dose of healthcare exposure. AbbVie (ABBV)Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com AbbVie (NASDAQ:ABBV) is the pharma spin-off from healthcare and medical devices leader Abbott (NYSE:ABT). Abbott seems to have made a wise move in spinning off AbbVie. Since the companies parted ways, Abbott's stock has more than doubled, while AbbVie has had a more difficult road.This makes sense. AbbVie inherited a complicated situation. Its blockbuster drug, Humira, currently makes up two-thirds of its overall revenues. However, Humira is set to face generic competition shortly, with its profits likely to head off the patent cliff by 2023. It's unclear if AbbVie will be able to make up the revenue gap that it will soon face.It intends to do so via its upcoming mega-merger with Allergan (NYSE:AGN). Allergan is famous for Botox, and it has numerous other products in the aesthetics space, along with other drugs for things such as eye care and womens' health. AbbVie hopes that merging with Allergan will diversify its revenue stream enough to withstand the loss of Humira revenues. However, it is taking on a ton of debt to do this deal. And it's not clear that Allergan, which had a similar business model to the now infamous Valeant, will fare well in a world with more drug pricing pressure.  * 10 2019 Winners That Will Be 2020 Losers A lot of folks own AbbVie for the generous 5.3% dividend yield. But it's far from certain whether the Allergan purchase will be enough to sustain the dividend at that elevated level. Particularly if drug pricing pressures increase, that dividend could be on the chopping block in coming years. I'm a seller of ABBV stock here. Gilead Sciences (GILD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) could fare better than most other biotech companies in a challenging drug pricing market. There are several reasons for that. For one, GILD stock has already been one of the biggest losers of the past few years within biotech, so expectations are already low.Second, Gilead has seen its profits fall because its Hepatitis C products actually cure patients, rather than merely treat symptoms. A Bloomberg article noted the unfortunate situation, saying that Wall Street Wants The Best Patents, Not The Best Drugs. The author concluded that Gilead had a &quot;bad business model&quot; because curing diseases &quot;just doesn't pay.&quot; That is, unfortunately, a seemingly accurate assessment of the current healthcare system.With an increased focus on pricing and getting the most bang for the buck, however, companies like Gilead should be more attractive to insurers and other end payers. Folks are increasingly sick of pharma companies jacking up prices for drugs that are only fractionally better than the previous version. Gilead hasn't played the same milking their patents for the most bucks game, and instead brought revolutionary products to market. After years of sorry stock price performance, however, Gilead may finally get its chance to shine in 2020. Thermo-Fisher Scientific (TMO)Source: Shutterstock Thermo-Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has quietly become one of the largest healthcare companies in the U.S., with its market capitalization now exceeding $125 billion. It has also been one of the strongest performers in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLV). With minimal volatility along the way, Thermo-Fisher shares have nearly tripled since early 2016.Their secret is that they are the proverbial company selling shovels to the gold miners. That's to say that Thermo Fisher sells lab equipment, pharmaceutical components, diagnostic tools and the like. Companies that want to create new pharma drugs, along with many other healthcare applications, have to buy raw materials from Thermo Fisher.  * 7 Best Vanguard ETFs for 2020 Lower drug prices might smack profits for biotech companies. But a firm like Thermo Fisher is insulated. Its components are a small portion of the overall price of healthcare products and services. Additionally, it has other customers, such as governments and academic institutions, that buy from it as well. As long as the world continues to spend more on healthcare research and diagnostics in the coming years, Thermo Fisher should be a safe bet to keep on rallying. The stock isn't dirt cheap at 24x forward earnings, but it's not a bad deal for a company that has much less regulatory/pricing risk than most biotech and pharma companies. Cardinal Health (CAH)Source: Shutterstock Finally, we have the drug distribution companies. While there are various firms in this category, let's use Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) as our representative stock, as Cardinal has been a popular dividend play and turnaround pick for 2020. And, to be sure, Cardinal has a great track record, including being a Dividend Aristocrat, which means that it has hiked its dividend more than 25 years in a row.I can't get on board with the bullish sentiment for this stock now, however. If you were looking for firms directly in the crosshairs of upcoming changes in drug prices, drug distributors would be right there. It's not clear what role, if any, these companies would even have in a Medicare For All world where the government controlled the supply chain.For the longest-time, the thesis on these companies has been that U.S. healthcare spending will inevitably rise as the population ages. That's been a good bet so far. But now U.S. spending per capita is far above levels seen in just about every other developed country. It seems healthcare and in particular drug prices are reaching a limit, and betting on middlemen like Cardinal to keep getting more profits over time might not be a wise move anymore. People have been buying the stock on expectations that the drug distributors will be able to handle their opoiod lawsuit obligations at a modest cost. That may be true, but even if it is, don't overlook the existential risk to this business model going forward. CAH stock is cheap for a good reason, it has the classic look of a value trap.At the time of this writing, Ian Bezek owned JNJ, NVO, and GILD stock. You can reach him on Twitter at @irbezek.

2020-01-30,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If you’re a prosecutor or a regulator looking to get a little good press, one surefire approach is to sue Martin Shkreli, the infamous “pharma bro.”That’s what New York State Attorney General Letitia James and the Federal Trade Commission did on Monday, and it worked like a charm. Reports popped up in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Toronto Star, CBS News, Daily Beast and many other outlets. James herself took a victory lap on Twitter:Shkreli is a perfect target. Five years ago, he became the symbol for outrageous drug prices after he raised the cost of his company’s one drug, Daraprim, to $750 a pill from $13.50 — and then basically laughed at everyone who complained. His nonstop smirking during a subsequent congressional hearing infuriated lawmakers. In the spring of 2018, he was sentenced to seven years in prison for committing financial fraud. Last year, he was transferred from federal prison in New Jersey after the Journal reported that he was using a contraband mobile phone to run the company from his cell. The charges leveled by the attorney general and the FTC against Shkreli(1)and the company — Vyera Pharmaceuticals LLC, as it’s now called(2)— flow directly from that now-infamous price increase. According to the complaint, they have been using illegal tactics to prevent low-cost generics from entering the market. For instance, Vyera drew up agreements with distributors that prevented them from selling Daraprim, which treats toxoplasmosis, to generic manufacturers. (Generic companies need access to the brand-name drugs to make their copies.) It had “data-blocking” agreements, which made it impossible for generic makers to obtain the information to assess whether enough patients needed the drug to make it worth pursuing. And it cut off competitors’ access to pyrimethamine, the active ingredient in Daraprim. All of these measures helped Daraprim maintain its monopoly — and its high price.All five of the FTC commissioners approved the lawsuit, although the two Democrats had reservations, which I’ll get to in a moment. In the FTC’s press release, Gail Levine, the deputy director of the agency’s bureau of competition, said that “Vyera kept the price of Daraprim astronomically high by illegally boxing out the competition.” In the New York attorney general’s press release, James described Shkreli as despicable and said that one of the goals of the lawsuit was to prevent him from ever working in the pharmaceutical industry again.“We won’t allow ‘Pharma Bros’ to manipulate the market and line their pockets at the expense of vulnerable patients and the health care system,” she added.Except pharma bros aren’t the problem. Shkreli jacked up the price of one drug with a small patient population. Meanwhile, the cost of insulin has tripled in the past decade, and many of the country’s 30 million diabetics are rationing insulin shots because they can’t afford the high price. The country’s three insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly & Co., Novo Nordisk A/S, and Sanofi, are not pharma bros.Humira, the world’s top-selling drug, costs $60,000 a year. Its manufacturer, AbbVie Inc., has successfully fended off generic competition for years. It’s not a pharma bro either. Neither is Roche Holdings AG, Gilead Science Inc. or Biogen Inc., which all have drugs whose prices have skyrocketed. When I asked Rutgers University law professor Michael Carrier why New York and the FTC weren’t going after these bigger — and, frankly, worthier — targets, he made a plausible case that the Daraprim situation was unique. Carrier co-wrote a paper in 2018 that laid out the way antitrust law could be used against Vyera and Shkreli — a paper that the state and the commission appear to have used as a blueprint.“With Daraprim, you can make a straightforward application of antitrust law,” he told me. “Everything they did had anticompetitive effects, and no pro-competition justification. It was maintaining its monopoly by taking actions that had no other rationale other than keeping competition away.”When I asked him why that was any different from, say, Humira, Carrier responded with one word: patents. AbbVie has protected Humira’s monopoly by surrounding the drug with dozens of add-on patents, a practice called “evergreening.” Although the ordinary person might view those patents as being solely intended to maintain the drug’s monopoly, courts tend to give great weight to patent protection. To make an antitrust case against Humira, the authorities would have to argue that its add-on patents are frivolous, and that’s not a winning argument, even if it’s true.Fair enough. Still, Big Pharma uses other tactics to keep generics off the market. Many companies now file “citizen’s petitions” to the Food and Drug Administration — originally intended to allow citizens to influence health policy — against other companies to keep their drugs off the market. They cut deals with generic companies to delay the introduction of a competitor. They also do some of the same things Vyera does to maintain Daraprim’s monopoly.So, yes, maybe a straightforward antitrust case wouldn’t work against these larger players. But there is something else the FTC could do to take on the big boys — and that’s what the two Democrats on the commission, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, suggested in their concurrent statements.Section 5 of the FTC Act gives the agency the ability to declare unlawful “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” Like many federal agencies, the FTC has become timid, so its use of this broad mandate has been circumscribed in recent decades. “I believe that some of the conduct alleged in the complaint,” against Shkreli and Vyera, Chopra wrote, “also constitutes a violation of the FTC Act’s prohibition of unfair acts and practices.”“I believe that the FTC and many of the State Attorneys General should pursue this legal claim in cases with the similar facts,” he said, adding, “I continue to be concerned that the FTC does not use its authority to the fullest extent possible to combat marketplace abuses. This is another missed opportunity for the Commission.”He’s right. If the FTC and James were willing to go after Big Pharma’s tactics using Section 5, they might be able to do something big and important to rein in drug prices. But that would be difficult, and they might not win. So instead they went after the easiest target on the planet: a “pharma bro” who’s already in prison.If and when they win the case, there will no doubt be another round of congratulatory press releases. And the price of insulin will keep going up.(1) James and the FTC also charged a third party in addition to Shkreli and Vyera: Kevin Mulleady, the chairman of Phoenixus AG, a Swiss company that controls Vyera.(2) It was called Turing Pharmaceuticals when Shkreli was the CEO.To contact the author of this story: Joe Nocera at jnocera3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.netThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.Joe Nocera is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.

2020-02-19,"Worth $23 billion today, former math professor Jim Simons has become one of the most successful money managers of all time. Following his departure from the world of academia in 1978, he helped jumpstart the quant investing revolution using a data-driven approach and predictive algorithms. Armed with the skills and experience acquired as a mathematician and code breaker, Simons founded hedge fund Renaissance Technologies out of a Long Island strip mall in 1982.Relying on an emotionless and hard data-focused strategy, his track record has surpassed that of other Wall Street greats like Steve Cohen, Ray Dalio and Warren Buffet, whose 20.5% annualized gains since 1965 pales in comparison to Simons’ 39% average return over the last 30 years. Additionally, since 1998, its Medallion Fund has seen annual returns reach 66% before fees.Even though Simons doesn’t manage the Medallion Fund anymore, he remains a key player at Renaissance. Regardless, the man that pioneered a fundamentally different way of thinking about investing has left a lasting impact. Currently, 31% of all stock trading is done by hedge funds and other quant investors, with much of their efforts modeled after his approach.It follows, then, that after Simons’ fund goes in on a particular name, Wall Street focus locks in. With this in mind, we used TipRanks’ Stock Screener tool to get all the data on three Buy-rated healthcare stocks Renaissance boosted its position in during the fourth quarter. Here’s what we found out.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK)Throughout the last 125 years, healthcare name Merck & Co. has become one of the major players in the space. While shares have slipped in the previous six months, Simons’ fund just pulled the trigger.According to the fund’s 13F filing, Renaissance bought 1,625,830 shares in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 41% increase. As its MRK stake now lands at 5,673,243, the total position is valued at almost $516 million.After its recent earnings release, analysts are also optimistic when it comes to Merck’s long-term growth prospects. In terms of non-GAAP EPS, the figure came in 1 cent ahead of the consensus at $1.16. Sales, however, missed the mark at $11.9 billion, which was $85 million below the Street’s prediction. MRK also revealed that it would be spinning off the women’s health, legacy brands and biosimilars into a NewCo.Weighing in on the company for Cantor Fitzgerald, Louise Chen writes that even though the print has caused investors to worry about slowing Keytruda sales, new data readouts for drugs that compete with MRK’s products and NewCo’s impact on EBITDA, the company is on track. The analyst highlights the fact that Keytruda, animal health, human health vaccines and overall worldwide sales all gained during the quarter. Not to mention through 2024, Merck expects solid revenue growth, which should accelerate thanks to the spin-off.“As a result of the incremental growth that NewCo is expected to achieve, combined with the benefit of ongoing operating efficiencies at MRK enabled by the spinoff, the company expects MRK and NewCo to realize higher combined non-GAAP EPS within 12-24 months post-spinoff,” Chen argued.Bearing this in mind, the analyst stayed with the bulls, reiterating an Overweight rating. At $107, the price target implies that a 30% twelve-month climb could be in the cards. (To watch Chen’s track record, click here)Meanwhile, Guggenheim’s Seamus Fernandez thinks the spin-off is the primary takeaway. “More important is today's news of the spin of the women's health, legacy brands and biosimilars into a NewCo, which we view as financially creative and potentially compelling, but further levers MRK to Keytruda. The strategic plan highlights MRK's conviction in its long-term growth prospects and, financially, we believe the decision makes sense long-term,” he explained. To this end, the five-star analyst left his Buy call and $105 price target as is. (To watch Fernandez’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, 6 Buys and 1 Hold add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. With a $99.38 average price target, the upside potential is 21%. (See Merck stock analysis on TipRanks)AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)AbbVie is known for being a research-driven biopharma company developing treatments to improve the lives of patients around the world. In the most recent quarter, the famous quant shop bumped up its ABBV holding by 62% after it picked up almost 4.5 million shares. Valued at over $1.04 billion, its overall holding is now made up of 11.8 million shares.According to several members of the Street, the billionaire has more than enough reason to be optimistic. During the fourth quarter, management’s worldwide 2020 guidance for Skyrizi flew past the almost $1 billion consensus estimate at $1.2 billion. Not to mention for Rinvoq, more than 95% of commercial lives are now covered and both Imbruvica and Venclexta are still grabbing market share despite the steep competition. What’s more, ABBV unveiled 30 proof-of-concept candidates that could see data released in the coming three years.UBS analyst Navin Jacob points out that the print wasn’t all positive, citing the disappointing results for Orilissa and HCV, but stated that he is still very much on board. “Strong Q4 print and even stronger 1020 guide (in-light of ABBV's historical conservatism) provides confidence to back up TRx trends that we see weekly for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We now expect ABBV to print more than $12 per share in 2021 EPS thus w/ dividend yield still at ~5% we think the stock will continue to work from here,” he explained.In addition, Jacob says that its early stage pipeline hasn’t been factored into his estimates, so a positive readout could lend itself to a re-rate. Based on all of the above factors, his recommendation remains a Buy. Adding to the good news, the analyst lifted the price target from $96 to $105, implying 12% upside potential. (To watch Jacob’s track record, click here)What do other analysts have to say about ABBV? It turns out that 5 out of 6 analysts that have published a recent review agree the stock is a Buy, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. Given the $100.50 average price target, shares could surge 7% in the next twelve months. (See AbbVie stock analysis on TipRanks)Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Simons’ fund also made a substantial purchase of pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb shares during the fourth quarter. With 11.9 million shares added, an 84% increase in the position’s size, Renaissance now owns over 60 million shares. All in all, the holding is worth a whopping $3.9 billion.Taking a look at BMY’s most recent earnings release, the company’s overall performance didn’t disappoint. Sales results were solid, and it didn’t announce any major surprises in terms of its initial guidance after the Celgene acquisition was finalized.As the healthcare company has $30 billion year end 2019 net debt and $18 billion of 2020 adjusted EBITDA, J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott believes that this year, it should be able to start deploying capital again. “Along these lines, the company announced an incremental $5 billion share repo program today. Overall, we see fairly meaningful capital deployment capacity for BMY over time and believe further tuck-in business development would be well received by the Street as the company looks to further build out its pipeline,” he noted.On top of this, Schott argues BMY’s pipeline is especially promising. “From here, we see the BMY story largely driven by a range of expected 2020 pipeline readouts (additional Opdivo readouts, TYK-2 phase 3, CELG pipeline updates), which if successful we see translating to upside to what we view as conservative out-year expectations. While the company clearly faces a challenging 2026-plus LOE cycle longer-term, we believe the company has a window to address these headwinds through a mix of its internal pipeline and business development,” he stated.It makes sense, then, that Schott raised the price target from $70 to $74 in addition to reiterating his Overweight call. This new target conveys his confidence in BMY’s ability to rise 12% over the next year. (To watch Schott’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, a Moderate Buy analyst consensus breaks down into 4 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months. Should the average price target of $71.60 be met, an 8% twelve-month gain could be on the horizon.

State Department officials disagreed and pushed for the patients to be included.The group was eventually flown back together, and the patients are being treated. Fifty-Nine Hong Kong Police Are Quarantined (1:24 p.m. NY)A group of 59 Hong Kong police officers are being quarantined after a fellow officer preliminarily tested positive for the virus, the city’s police force said in a statement on Facebook.Two days before being tested because he was feeling sick, the police officer had a meal with the 59 other officers at a restaurant in Hong Kong.“After learning of the incident, the police have immediately arranged that all colleagues immediately stop police work, avoid contact with the public, and go home to wait for quarantine arrangements,” the department said in the statement.The officer works with a riot team in Hong Kong’s Eastern Police District. Members of the riot control unit that the sick officer is part of aren’t being considered close contacts subject to quarantine, the department said.Drug-Trial Results Expected in Three Weeks, WHO Says (11:53 a.m. NY)Preliminary results from two clinical trials of treatments prioritized by the World Health Organization are expected in three weeks, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva Thursday.One of the trials is for a pill combining the anti-retroviral medicines lopinavir and ritonavir, a brand-name combination of which is sold by AbbVie Inc. The second trial is testing the experimental injected drug remdesivir, which is being developed by Gilead Sciences Inc.The trials are being run in China, where health officials are seeking ways to treat patients infected with the coronavirus using existing and experimental therapies.Airlines Expect First Global Traffic Drop Since 2009 (11:20 a.m. NY)The airline industry expects the first annual decline in global passenger demand in 11 years, after tallying up the initial impact of the thousands of flights canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak in China.The estimate shaves about 4.7 percentage points off of a passenger-growth forecast issued just two months ago, with almost all of the impact in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the International Air Transport Association. That may be conservative: The projections assume the loss of demand will be limited to markets linked to China.The drop would be the first overall decline since the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Global passenger demand is now seen contracting by 0.6% this year, compared with a December forecast for 4.1% growth, IATA said.WHO Says More Funding Needed to Fight Virus (10:50 a.m. NY)The head of the World Health Organization urged countries to boost funding to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, saying that the response to its call for $675 million has been limited.“This is the time to attack the virus while it is manageable,” Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing in Geneva Thursday.Tedros said he’s surprised donations have been low and that countries aren’t treating the outbreak seriously enough. If the response isn’t strong now, the spread outside of China, which so far has been manageable, may become a wider threat, he said. “The virus is very dangerous, and it’s public enemy No. 1.”Foxconn, Norwegian Cruise Warns on Virus Impact (7:57 a.m. NY)Apple Inc. supplier Foxconn said the virus will impact 2020 revenue. Separately, Norwegian Cruise Line said the outbreak has caused it to cancel, modify or redeploy 40 Asia voyages, hurting projected earnings. Earlier, Air France-KLM slumped after it said the outbreak will wipe as much as $216 million from earnings and Qantas Airways Ltd. said it is slashing capacity on international flights in Asia.Lenovo Group Ltd. warned of “short-term volatility and challenges” because of disruptions at its suppliers, but said most of its plants had re-started operations and demand should rebound once the outbreak stabilizes. A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S is also positioning itself for a “strong rebound” based on an expectation that the fallout of the coronavirus on global trade may soon peak.Goldman Sees High Risk of Stock Correction (7:36 a.m. NY)Investors may be underestimating the negative impact of the coronavirus on corporate earnings, which poses a threat to the stock market rally, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chief equity strategist.While coronavirus fears triggered a worldwide sell-off in January, those losses proved short-lived. Global equities are trading near record highs on optimism that the impact from the epidemic will be limited and China will step up support for its economy. Goldman’s Peter Oppenheimer cautioned against complacency.“While a sustained bear market does not look likely, a near-term correction is looking much more probable,” Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in a note.China Urges More Production Resumption (6:56 a.m. NY)Local governments should seek to increase the rate of resumed production, China Central Television reported, citing Premier Li Keqiang.Deutsche Bank Singapore Employee Infected (6:42 a.m. NY)An employee at Deutsche Bank’s Singapore office, located at One Raffles Quay, has tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The bank said it deep cleaned the office, and completed contact tracing when first notified.Baselworld Watch Fair Still On (6:52 p.m. HK)The watch industry trade fair will go ahead as scheduled in late April. Organizers are in contact with health authorities and will take precautions including more frequent cleaning and disinfecting.Hubei Asks Firms Not to Resume Work Before March 11 (6:14 p.m. HK)Producers of drugs, medical equipment and protective items are not subject to the requirement, according to a statement from the Hubei provincial government.All Westerdam Crew Tested Negative for Coronavirus (6:13 p.m. HK)The Cambodian Ministry of Health confirmed all 747 crew on board the Westerdam ship have tested negative for the coronavirus, according to an emailed statement from Holland America Line which owns the vessel.Separately, Dream Cruises said it will suspend the Genting Dream Cruise from Singapore until March 27.China Considers Prolonging Electric-Car Subsidies (6:10 p.m. HK)Beijing may extend subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases beyond this year in an effort to revive sales in the world’s biggest market, people familiar with the matter said. The move could add to state aid being considered in wake of virus.Policy makers have been discussing the possibility after China’s first annual decline in sales of new energy vehicles, according to the people. Though the talks predate the emergence of the coronavirus as a global threat, the outbreak has piled more pressure on the auto industry by causing production halts and keeping people away from showrooms.Iran Reports Three Confirmed Cases After Two Deaths (5:18 p.m HK)Iran reported three more cases, a day after confirming two people had died from the outbreak. Two residents in Qom and one in Arak and have been hospitalized, state-run Iranian Students News Agency said, citing the country’s health ministry.China Says 29 Foreigners Infected (4:51 p.m. HK)Ten people were diagnosed in the Hubei province, Ding Xiangyang, deputy secretary-general at the State Council said. Two foreign nationals have died and 18 have been discharged.Indonesia Cuts Rates, Lowers Growth Forecast (4:30 p.m. HK)Indonesia’s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate after a three-month pause, and lowered the growth forecast as the spread of the coronavirus threatens the outlook for Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.South Korea Reports First Death (4:24 p.m. HK)South Korea reported its first fatality from the coronavirus as confirmed cases more than tripled within a day. The bulk of the increase is tied to a cluster from a religious sect and the outbreak has raised renewed concerns about the virus in the country after a lull in reported cases last week.South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of domestic cases had reached 104. The CDC didn’t provide many details on the fatality but gave its location as a hospital near Daegu, one of the country’s biggest cities where infections have been found among members of the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, formerly known as Shincheonji Church of Jesus.The center said at least 28 new cases confirmed on Thursday involved those who attended church services with a person confirmed with the virus earlier this week. The pastor told JoongAng Ilbo newspaper in an interview that some 1,000 people attended the same service.Hubei Region Sells First Bonds Since Lockdown Began (3:46 p.m. HK)The Chinese province at the center of the outbreak sold about 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) of bonds in its first public fundraising effort since Beijing quarantined its capital.Japan Confirms Two From Cruise Died From Virus (2:14 p.m. HK)Japan confirmed two people who were on the cruise ship off Yokohama died from the novel coronavirus. The fatalities were a man and woman, both Japanese nationals in their 80s, who had existing medical conditions, NHK reported.The cruise ship has the most infections anywhere outside China, with more than 600 confirmed cases. Following 14 days of quarantine, Japan on Wednesday allowed passengers to start disembarking from the Diamond Princess liner, despite worries the country hasn’t done enough to prevent the spread of disease from the vessel.China Premier Says Don’t Halt Grain Planting (2:10 p.m. HK)Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told local governments to make sure farmers don’t miss the crucial grain planting season during a critical time for controlling the spread of coronavirus. Government officials are worried that the epidemic could spread to rural areas, where medical facilities are less developed than urban locales.“If we miss the planting season, we’ll be unable to make up for it, which will have an impact on the economic foundation and social stability of the whole year,” Li said in a release posted on the government’s website. “We are holding the rice bowl for 1.4 billion people in our own hands.”Fecal Transmission May Be Behind Virus’s Rapid Spread (12:37 p.m. HK)The novel coronavirus is shed in the feces of infected people, which may help explain why it’s spread so fast, according to Chinese researchers. The finding of live virus particles in stool specimens indicates a fecal-oral route for coronavirus, which may be why it’s caused outbreaks on cruise ships with an intensity often seen with gastro-causing norovirus, which also spreads along that pathway.Hong Kong Extends Work-From-Home for Civil Servants (12:23 p.m. HK)Hong Kong will extend work-from-home arrangements for civil servants to March 1 to reduce social contacts and the risk of spread of novel coronavirus in the community, according to an official statement. The government previously announced it would extend the work-from-home arrangement for civil servants to Feb. 23.U.S. Condemns China’s Expulsion of WSJ Reporters (11:04 a.m. HK)U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China’s move to revoke the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters over a controversial headline, a decision that comes as Beijing continues to lash out at countries that fault its handling of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.China Loan Rate Drops After Central Bank Eases Policy (9:48 a.m. HK)China’s banks lowered the benchmark borrowing costs for new corporate and household loans after Beijing slashed a range of policy rates this month to blunt the economic impact of a deadly virus outbreak. Earlier this month, the central bank cut the rates on its short-term funds and one-year loans to commercial lenders.Hubei Adds Fewer New Cases (7:50 a.m. HK)China’s Hubei province reported 349 additional confirmed cases for Feb. 19, a sharp drop from almost 1,700 the previous day. No explanation was given for the decline, although it came a day after national guidelines advised the province to only report two numbers in its overall count: confirmed cases and suspected cases. Prior to that, the province reported whether cases were confirmed via CT scans, or testing kits.China has faced questions about the transparency of its data as it repeatedly adjusts how it reports coronavirus cases. Last week, a shift in methods resulted in a surge of almost 15,000 new Hubei cases.(An earlier version of this story was corrected the story after an airline industry group revised its statement to say it would be first drop in travel since 2009, not 2003, in the 11:20 a.m. update)&#92;--With assistance from Michelle Fay Cortez, Jason Gale, Peter Pae, Jihye Lee and Siddharth Dahiya.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Thomas Mulier in Geneva at tmulier@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Adveith Nair at anair29@bloomberg.net;Jeff Sutherland at jsutherlan13@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Disagreement on Japan Evacuees; Cops Quarantined: Virus Update

2020-03-02,"(Bloomberg) -- A Chinese biotech company which claimed to be able to manufacture an experimental drug from Gilead Sciences Inc. with the potential to treat the novel coronavirus, was censured for disclosing inaccurate information.The Shanghai Stock Exchange said in an statement Sunday that BrightGene Bio-Medical Technology Co. has not gained approval from China’s drug regulator to make the drug known as remdesivir, which is seen as the leading candidate in the race to find a treatment for the virus that’s now sickened over 88,000 and killed over 3,000.BrightGene also has not been licensed by the patent owner -- Gilead -- to make the drug, nor has it obtained “the relevant qualifications” for mass production of the therapy, said the stock exchange. Shares fell by the daily limit of 20% intraday on Monday.Gilead’s experimental drug, which has not been licensed or approved for use anywhere in the world, is being tested in clinical trials at hospitals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, as well as in other Asian nations.BrightGene’s announcement on Feb. 12 that it had managed to manufacture remdesivir in mass quantities garnered global headlines and sent its stock up nearly 60% last month to touch a record high. The stock exchange’s reprimand comes as concerns grow that researchers and drugmakers in China and elsewhere are seizing on the global panic around the growing epidemic to get attention for less-than-credible scientific work.BrightGene, for example, had only been able to make remdesivir in a small quantity for clinical research and not commercial production and its elision of this difference led to the spread of “unclear, inaccurate information,” said the stock exchange.BrightGene’s board secretary Wang Zhengye, who gave interviews to local media outlets saying the company’s drug is not for just for laboratory use but for mass production, was also reprimanded by the exchange.With the virus now being reported in over 65 countries, exuberance among investors and medical companies around the development of treatments and vaccines is running the risk of becoming irrational and diverting resources from the most crucial scientific work.Raised ConcernsNearly 300 clinical trials have been registered in China so far to study the efficacy of various coronavirus treatments from Gilead’s remdesivir and AbbVie Inc.’s anti-HIV therapy Kaletra, to traditional Chinese medicine and even soy milk.The design and execution of some of these trials have raised concerns among scientists, according to an article published last week in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology.The surge of trials has also led to a scramble for patients as test subjects, thus potentially delaying the progress of serious research that could lead to the discovery of effective therapies.World Health Organization assistant director-general Bruce Aylward called for researchers to prioritize the most promising studies last week and said that Chinese researchers are facing difficulty recruiting enough patients into trials for remdesivir, which he said is the only drug that may be effective.“We are doing lots of other studies with things that are less promising,” he said.To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Dong Lyu in Beijing at dlyu3@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rachel Chang at wchang98@bloomberg.net, Bhuma ShrivastavaFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",Chinese Biotech Censured for False Claim on Gilead’s Virus Drug

2020-03-06,"Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) jumped more than 6% on Wednesday, after the company announced a plan to test some of its antiviral products as a potential treatment for the coronavirus from China.Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com More than 35 million shares traded on the news -- about 48% more than normal -- as investors looked for any positive news from the pharma community after the recent selloff.So, does this mean that Pfizer stock is turning the corner?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI don't think so. What Is Moving PFE Stock?Pfizer officials were among those pharma executives called to the White House on Monday in an attempt to soothe the markets and demonstrate that the White House was moving proactively to keep the coronavirus from turning into a pandemic.The virus so far has infected more than 100,000 people in at least 78 countries. There have been 14 deaths in the U.S. and more than 3,300 around the world.  * 9 Stocks to Buy If People Get Stuck at Home On Monday night, Pfizer announced it is working with a third party to screen experimental antivirals. Results could come by the end of the month, with human testing by the end of the year if the results are successful.Even so, Pfizer is behind its rivals in the race for a coronavirus treatment. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) is testing an antiviral drug already in some Asian countries. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) donated Kaletra/Aluvia, its HIV treatment, to China to test as a possible coronavirus treatment.Just a day after Pfizer's announcement, the company's chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, seemed to downplay any notion that Pfizer -- or any other company -- would be a leader in a coronavirus treatment. Writing for Forbes, he said:&quot;… one company, one vaccine, one test or one medicine will not be an effective solution to overcoming the tremendous task at hand. This pursuit requires a crucial multi-pronged approach with a deep collaboration and partnership across the health innovation ecosystem -- from the academic community, industry partners, policymakers and regulatory bodies. A challenge like coronavirus requires every organization to bring forward its resources and expertise to manage health risks that evolve daily.&quot;In other words, don't except any bump in Pfizer stock to be sustainable. Pfizer at a GlanceDespite Wednesday's surge, Pfizer stock remains in an unenviable position. PFE is down 11% year-to-date and 19% in the last 12 months. ABBV and GILD, meanwhile are both up roughly 10%-20% in the last year.In its most recent earnings report, Pfizer reported a fourth-quarter miss in earnings (55 cents per share against an expected 57 cents), but managed to beat on revenue ($12.69 billion against an expected $12.61 billion).The company recorded an operating loss of $326 million for the quarter. It forecast 2020 earnings of $2.82 to $2.92 per share on revenue of $48.5 billion to $50.5 billion. Wall Street is expecting EPS of $2.90 per share and revenue of $50.2 billion.Pfizer hopes to close its deal to merge Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) with its Upjohn generic drug business sometime this year. If the deal closes, the new business will spin off into its own company. Its Upjohn has significant business in China, so Pfizer hopes that the newly formed company will become a global pharmaceutical leader. But there are legitimate short-term concerns about how the continuing coronavirus in China will affect testing and distribution.More importantly for investors, the spinoff will immediately devalue PFE stock as the company loses its Upjohn assets. It's also likely that Pfizer's current 4.2% dividend will take a hit. The Bottom LinePfizer stock has a &quot;D&quot; rating in my Portfolio Grader because of its weak earnings, sales and cash growth. And with the impending Mylan-Upjohn spinoff sapping PFE of assets, I don't see anything this week to change that assessment.There are better growth stocks out there than Pfizer.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett. In his latest feat, Louis discovered the &quot;Master Key&quot; to profiting from the biggest tech revolution of this (or any) generation.

Delta is grounding half the fleet to wipe out 70% of capacity, while Qantas, which has been idling planes weeks, is ceasing international operations.Wristband Trackers to Control Infected Travelers in Asia (5:40 p.m. HK)Asian countries battling a new wave of coronavirus infections brought in by travelers from abroad are turning to high-tech wristband monitors, jail time and steep fines in an escalation of containment measures.Hong Kongers With Virus Went to Gyms in City’s Center (5:30 p.m. HK)Two coronavirus patients visited gyms near the heart of Hong Kong’s central business district, adding to concern about a recent uptick in cases in the Asian financial hub.

That’s more than double the level two weeks ago.German Confidence Plunges (5:06 p.m. HK)German business confidence is falling off a cliff, offering chilling evidence that Europe’s largest economy may be headed for its worst recession since the global financial crisis.

His remarks come after the Tokyo 2020 CEO said the organizing committee hadn’t yet planned ways to ensure the safety of athletes, fans and staff.Abe has recently begun to shift his messaging on the games, in a sign that he may have accepted the spread of the coronavirus will make it necessary to postpone the event, set to start in July.

The research was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.Twitter Cracks Down on Misinformation (7:59 a.m. HK)Twitter Inc. said it’s expanding rules to capture misinformation around the virus, following a similar escalation of measures from Facebook Inc.

2020-03-27,"After a stunning fall to $10, shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) have since been on a tear. Note that AAL stock is now at $15. Yet despite this rally, the company still sports a miserable year-to-date loss of 50%.Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com The volatility is certainly understandable as it is extremely difficult to gauge the future of American Airlines. The big issue, of course, is how long the depressed levels of travel will last. The coronavirus from China is a global menace. So just in terms of foreign travel, it could easily be several months or more with little revenue generation for AAL.Another issue is that the coronavirus may be seasonal. On Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: &quot;I know we'll be successful in putting this down now, but we really need to be prepared for another cycle.&quot;InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAnd while there are hints of progress on a coronavirus vaccine -- such as from companies like AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) -- the general availability of any treatment will likely take more than a year because of the clinical trials.In other words, this year could easily see consistently depressed travel volumes. What's more, there will likely be much consumer resistance to resume flying. A recent survey from The Harris Poll shows that 1 in 5 would wait at least four months after the curve on the coronavirus flattens before getting on a plane again. AAL Stock FundamentalsAmong the major airline operators, American Airlines is one of the weaker firms. Note that the company went bankrupt in 2011. And as for the past three years, it has seen negative free cash flows despite a robust global economy and secular growth trends in the industry.  * 10 Stocks to Buy That Will Benefit From Coronavirus Mayhem The balance sheet is also far from inspiring. While there is $3.8 billion in cash and short-term securities -- as of the end of 2019 -- the debt load is enormous. Consider that short and long-term liabilities are over $24 billion. By comparison, the market capitalization for AAL stock is only $6.2 billion.Granted, it seems remote that the company will go bust. First of all, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett has a 10% stake. It seems reasonable that he would want to find ways to provide assistance. After all, this is what he did during the financial crisis with companies like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).Then there is the likely federal aid coming from the $2 trillion stimulus bill. These funds would likely be a way to shore-up the requirements to meet payrolls. However, there will be string attached, such as prohibitions on buybacks dividends. The Bottom Line on American Airlines StockAnalysts at Bank of America have put a $5 price target on AAL stock. Simply put, they think that the headwinds are just too powerful.Now I do think this may be too extreme. Again, the company is likely to remain solvent. And by next year, the environment for flying should be much improved -- which should mean a spike in earnings and revenues.But in the meantime, it could be tough to see continued gains with AAL stock. If anything, the recent spike in shares has already baked in much of the good news, such as the federal stimulus. Thus, for now, it's probably a good idea to wait and see.Tom Taulli (@ttaulli) is the author of various books on investing and technology, including Artificial Intelligence Basics, High-Profit IPO Strategies and All About Short Selling.

2020-03-31,"In times of market turmoil, one group of stocks that investors can count on to deliver reliable income growth is the Dividend Aristocrats: an elite group of companies that have produced at least 25 consecutive years of dividend hikes.During the 2010s, these high-quality stocks returned an average of 14.75% per year, besting the S&P; 500 by 1.2 percentage points. A big reason for the Dividend Aristocrats' outperformance, especially over the long term, is the high dividend component of their returns.Studies by Standard & Poor's have shown that more than one-third of the long-term total return of stocks comes from dividends. In the case of the Aristocrats, many of them traditionally don't boast attractive yields for new money. But investors that stick with them over the long haul are rewarded with growing &quot;yields on cost&quot; over time.Reliable payouts also help make this group less risky than most other stocks. For instance, volatility of the Dividend Aristocrats' returns during the 2010s, as measured by standard deviation - a measure of how widely or narrowly prices are dispersed compared to an average - was more than 9% lower than the S&P; 500.That doesn't make them invulnerable from market downturns. A number of Dividend Aristocrats have gone on discount, losing 10%, 20%, even 30% of their value since the start of the bear market. But they offer more than cheap prices - they offer real value, both in higher-than-usual yields as well as snap-back potential once the market rebounds.Here are 19 Dividend Aristocrats that should appeal to investors who want safety and reliably rising dividends at discounted prices.

EPS guidance for the year could move lower, although a step-up rebound could be in the cards in 2021 against trough valuation.&quot;We want to get ahead of that as the market ultimately shifts from defensive to offensive positioning,&quot; the analyst wrote in the note.Related Link: The Week Ahead In Biotech: Eli Lilly, Biogen Earnings On Tap, Sanofi Awaits FDA DecisionDelving on AbbVie's businesses, the analyst sees the COVID-19 impact on the company to be greater than that of peers. Although the consensus has not moved down sufficiently to reflect the risk, the analyst is of the view the focus is quickly shifting to beyond this &quot;transition&quot; year.Stanicky braces for a messy year for AbbVie, as the Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) acquisition is expected to close soon and the COVID-19 impact continues into summer. Consequently, the analyst sees some stock disruption.&quot;But 2021 should &quot;step up&quot; to more &quot;normalized&quot; earnings with relatively quick bounce-back around core franchises,&quot; he said.With the pro forma valuation at historical lows, the firm said the closing of the Allergan deal will serve as a catalyst.ABBV Price Action AbbVie shares were up 1.8% to $84.96 at time of publicationLatest Ratings for ABBV  DateFirmActionFromTo  Apr 2020RBC CapitalUpgradesSector PerformOutperform  Apr 2020UBSMaintainsBuy  Mar 2020Societe GeneraleDowngradesBuyHold    View More Analyst Ratings for ABBV   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * The Daily Biotech Pulse: Amarin Faces Legal Setback, Milestone Payment Kicks In For CytomX, Savara, Reata Disclose COVID-19 Disruptions  * 7 Safe Dividend Plays For 2020  * The Daily Biotech Pulse: Milestone Pharma Flunks Late-Stage Study, CytomX Strikes Cancer Drug Collaboration, BARDA Grant For GenMark's COVID-19 Test(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-04-21,"Steep market declines in 2020 have not only been brutal on returns; they've also presented income investors with a conundrum. The market is suddenly flooded with a glut of high-yield dividend stocks, but dividends in general are less safe than they've been in more than a decade.The S&P; 500 has quickly risen from a yield of 1.8% at the end of December to a yield of about 2.1% today. That's still not an exciting number, of course. But both inside and outside the index, a number of stocks have seen their yields double, triple or more. That has made it easier than it has been in a long time to find high-yield dividend stocks offering up sizable income of greater than 5%.At the same time, however, the market has been flooded with a run of dividend cuts. Some companies are watching their profits plunge as people are confined to their homes, creating short-term cash crunches that are forcing them to conserve as much capital as possible simply to survive.The trick, then, lies in identifying great-yielding names that will be able to maintain their dividends even if this shutdown triggers a prolonged recession.Here are eight of the safest high-yield dividend stocks right now. These stocks boast several traits that speak to dividend safety, from conservative balance sheets and durable cash flows to histories of maintaining dividends through previous economic downturns.

2020-05-06,"AbbVie’s (ABBV) plan to close the $63 billion Allergan (AGN) deal this month appears on track following the announcement that they have received US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearance for the deal.The acceptance of the proposed consent order by the FTC satisfies all the required antitrust clearances needed for AbbVie to buy Allergan.As part of the proposed consent, Allergan has agreed to divest brazikumab, an investigational IL-23 inhibitor in development for autoimmune diseases, to AstraZeneca (AZN).Plus it will sell Zenpep, a treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis and other conditions, to Nestle. Nestle will also acquire Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme preparation, as part of the same transaction.Additionally, AbbVie and Allergan have amended the Transaction Agreement to allow only one Allergan Director will join the AbbVie board following close. Allergan’s current Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders will not join the AbbVie Board in order to pursue other opportunities, the press release revealed.Going forward, the acquisition is still subject to other customary closing conditions and Irish High Court approval- with a hearing scheduled for today May 6.Mizuho Securities’ Vamil Divan gives the deal his seal of approval. A key concern surrounding the Allergan deal has been whether the FTC might require AbbVie to divest its key growth driver Skyrizi, says Divan. “This investor concern should finally be allayed, as the FTC appears satisfied with the divestiture of Allergan’s brazikumab (IL-23) back to AstraZeneca instead” the analyst wrote.He continues to see AbbVie as a ‘top large-cap pick’ and believes the Allergan deal changes the AbbVie story for the better. “It brings in additional growth drivers at an attractive price, including products early in their life cycle (e.g. Vraylar, Ubrelvy) and others that should be highly durable (e.g. Botox, Juvederm), as well as >$2Bn in expense synergies” Divan told investors on May 5.Indeed, the stock boasts a firmly bullish Strong Buy Street consensus with an average analyst price target of $100 (17% upside potential). That falls just under Divan’s own price target of $101.

AbbVie, which has been under pressure to diversify its portfolio, said in June 2019 that it would acquire Allergan in a deal that gives AbbVie control over the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and buys time to seek new growth before its arthritis treatment Humira loses U.S. patent protection in 2023.

2020-05-08,"AbbVie's (ABBV) acquisition of Allergan has entered the final stretch, after the FTC (federal trading commission) gave its consent for the deal to go ahead. With approval from the Irish High Court the final hurdle left, following Wednesday’s hearing, the transaction should come to a close.Apprehension surrounding the acquisition’s clearance by the FTC, concerned the possible requirement to divest AbbVie’s main growth driver - Skyrizi.&quot;This investor concern should finally be allayed, as the FTC appears satisfied with the divestiture of Allergan’s brazikumab (IL-23) back to AstraZeneca instead,” said Mizuho analyst Vamil DivanAdditionally, Allergan will sell Nestle two of its pancreatic enzyme preparations, Zenpep and Viokace.As all these assets’ divestitures were expected, Divan believes these developments should come as no surprise to investors who have been monitoring the deal’s progress.However, as part of the transaction, an unexpected agreement regarding personnel was reached. Only one Allergan Director will join the AbbVie board, while Allergan’s current Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders will “pursue other opportunities in the sector.”“We are not concerned about this and are comforted by the fact that Allergan's Carrie Strom (Senior Vice President of US Medical Aesthetics) will be on the AbbVie Executive Leadership Team as President of Global Allergan Aesthetics,” Divan commented.Divan looks favorably upon the deal and argues the diversification should pay off, especially when considering the future sales of AbbVie’s drug Humira. The world’s best-selling drug has struggled on the international market since generic versions began selling in Europe in 2018. The drug faces further competition at home when biosimilars will enter the market in 2023.Calling AbbVie, his “top large cap pick,” Divan concluded, “We believe the Allergan deal changes the AbbVie story for the better as it brings in additional growth drivers at an attractive price, including products early in their life cycle (e.g. Vraylar, Ubrelvy) and others that should be highly durable (e.g. Botox, Juvederm), as well as &gt;$2Bn in expense synergies.”Divan keeps a Buy rating on AbbVie along with a $101 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of 20% from current levels. (To watch Divan’s track record, click here)The Street is equally confident. 7 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average target comes in just below Divan’s, and at $100.14, indicates potential upside of 17%.

2020-05-13,"Despite the pandemic risk, one analyst at Morgan Stanley remains bullish on AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV).The AbbVie Analyst David Risinger maintained an Overweight on AbbVie with a $95 price target. The AbbVie Thesis Risks to U.S. sales stemming from unemployment and the Humira patent cliff are likely to be  pushbacks for  AbbVie, Risinger said in a Wednesday note. (See his track record here.)AbbVie's U.S. commercial exposure is at 42% of global sales compared to Eli Lilly And Co's (NYSE: LLY) 30%, the analyst said. Notwithstanding the pushback, he said he sees AbbVie stock's valuation and yield as attractive. Though Risinger said he is cognizant of the patent cliff faced by AbbVie's rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, he chooses to focus beyond that issue. Below-consensus sales of Humira in the 2023-24 period will be offset by higher excluding-Humira sales, the analyst said. Risinger sees the gentlest cliff for AbbVie. He estimates that 45% of the company's 2023 estimate is at risk to generic or biosimilar competition by 2030, which he said is the smallest percentage of five large-caps that include Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE: BMY).Discussing a &quot;wildcard&quot; catalyst for the stock, Risinger said AbbVie is due to release Phase 2 results on ABBV-3373 soon, with the investigational asset being an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of an anti-TNF antibody and a steroid.Given the low odds of success and that the company hasn't yet demonstrated human efficacy proof-of-concept, the analyst said that if Phase 2 data is surprisingly compelling, AbbVie shares could step higher. If it fails, ABBV shares may only trade off slightly, he said. &quot;We view Humira erosion fears as overly discounted and Abbvie's prospects as underappreciated.&quot;ABBV Price Action At last check, AbbVie shares were trading down 1.4% at $89.19.

2020-05-20,"Times right now are unprecedented. The COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching government responses, the social and economic shutdowns – all are putting extraordinary pressures on financial markets. From the sudden equity collapse that started in late February, to the bear market rally we’re experiencing now, investors simply haven’t got the usual market signals they rely on.Covering the overall situation, JPMorgan chief of Equity Strategy Dubravko Lakos-Bujas points out, “The sharp ~30% recovery in S&P 500 from the Mar 23 trough, even as earnings expectations and macro outlook were steadily being revised lower by the street, has come as a surprise to many.” Lakos-Bujas also notes that government stimulative policies have matched the extraordinary conditions with equally extraordinary liquidity injections – and that the fiscal and monetary stimulus has put a floor in the equity markets.Looking ahead, the analyst says, “[We] have been arguing that this unprecedented stimulus and liquidity boom will outlast the health crisis. Our valuation models imply that the equity risk premia remains attractive…”In line with JPM’s official analysis of market risks, the firm’s stock analysts have been picking possible winners – and losers. We’ve looked at three of those stocks through the lens of the TipRanks database, to find out what makes two of them compelling buys – and what makes the third a stock to avoid.Federated Hermes (FHI)We’ll start with a financial company. Federated Hermes is an asset management company, controlling an equity portfolio worth $68 billion and holding $606 billion in assets under management. AUM hit a record in the first quarter of this year.While Q1 2020 saw EPS fall – the COVID-19 epidemic has been painful across the board – the 63 cents reported was still up 16% year-over-year. The company credits long-term assets for 56% of quarterly revenue.Solid earnings support a reliable dividend. FHI has grown the payment slowly over recent years, and currently pays out 27 cents per share quarterly. At $1.08 annualized, this makes the dividend yield 5.1%, or more than double the average yield among peer financial sector stocks.This company’s strong position has brought it to JPM’s attention. Analyst Ken Worthington upgraded the JPM view on FHI from Neutral to Buy. He set a $27 price target for the end of 2020, suggesting an upside potential here of 28%. (To watch Worthington’s track record, click here)In his comments on the stock, Worthington wrote, “…Federated could keep more of the earnings driven by the massive increase in money market fund assets. We see the rest of Federated's business performing adequately and better than most, leveraging some good positioning, solid performance and its strengthening brand in ESG.”Overall, Wall Street is cautious on FHI shares. The analyst corps has delivered 2 Buy ratings – but 4 Holds, making the analyst consensus rating a Moderate Buy. The average price target is $23.20, which indicates a modest upside of 10%. (See Federated Hermes stock analysis on TipRanks)AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV)Next up is a pharmaceutical company, one of Big Pharma’s major names. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are known for their combination of high risk and high reward potential. The rewards and risks are both typified in Humira, the company’s successful immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory drug. Humira is expected to bring in ~40% of AbbVie’s 2020 drug division revenues – but with an expired patent, competition is growing. Last year, Humira accounted for 50% of drug revenues.AbbVie is fortunate to have a strong product line-up, with new drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq beating the expectations on their launches and projected to bring in $4.5 and $5 billion in revenue, respectively, by 2025.The company saw solid earnings in 2019, and in Q1 2020, despite the coronavirus disruptions to economic activity, ABBV reported a substantial sequential earnings increase. EPS grew 9.5% to $2.42, and beat the forecast 6.6%.Earnings growth has allowed ABBV to keep up a reliable dividend, one of the best in the pharmaceutical sector. The company has increased its dividend payment four times in the past three years, including in Q1 2020. The current payment is $4.72 annualized, with quarterly payments of $1.18. The yield is nearly 5.2%, which simply blows away the healthcare sector average yield of 1.75%.Chris Schott, in his note on ABBV for JPM, sees a clear path forward for the company. He writes, “On the core portfolio, we anticipate ~9% annual growth in the company’s $30bn non-Humira business led by … Skyrizi and Rinvoq... ABBV’s pipeline represents another potential upside driver with little value being assigned to the company’s mid-stage assets… we see the company’s dividend as highly sustainable…”In line with his comments, Schott initiates coverage of ABBV for JPM with a Buy rating. His $105 price target implies a healthy upside potential of 15%. (To watch Schott’s track record, click here)The Wall Street view of ABBV shares is almost as bullish as Schott’s. The Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 10 reviews, including 7 Buys and 3 Holds. Shares in this pharma giant are selling for $91.20, and the average price target of $101.13 suggests it has room for 11% growth this year. (See AbbVie stock analysis on TipRanks)Quidel Corporation (QDEL)Last up is a big player in the diagnostic healthcare segment. Quidel, and American company based in San Diego, operates worldwide. Earlier this month, Quidel scored a major coup: it received authorization from the US FDA, the regulatory body for the health care and pharmaceutical sector, to produce a COVID-19 antigen test.This authorization shows up Quidel’s strength in the ‘Age of Corona:’ the company produces diagnostic tests, and those are in high demand. Such high demand that, while the markets generally turned bearing in February, QDEL shares started climbing – bringing year-to-date gains to 148%.With earnings up and an approved authorization for development and production if a COVID-19 diagnostic test, it would seem that QDEL is primed for gains. And yet JPM says to sell this stock. Why the bearish call?In short, Quidel’s recent steep share price gains have overvalued this stock. As 5-star analyst Tycho Peterson says in his review of QDEL shares, “…while not ruling out the COVID-19 antigen testing opportunity, we believe it may be overstated due to the nascent market, scale-up of competitive tests and potential for avaccine in 12-18 months, leaving us skeptical of the opportunity implied by the stock move.”Peterson is careful not to blast the company, but he does downgrade his stance of QDEL from Neutral to Sell. His $158 price target projects a 15% downside for the shares this year. (To watch Peterson’s track record, click here)The market’s collective wisdom agrees. QDEL has a Moderate Sell consensus rating, based on 2 Holds and 1 Sell rating. At $124, the average price target implies a 33% downside from the current share price of $186.05.

2020-06-01,"AbbVie (ABBV) announced on Monday that it has entered into a partnership with Jacobio Pharmaceuticals, to jointly develop and commercialize SHP2 inhibitors, which target a key node in cancer and immune cells.Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed. Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will be granted an exclusive license to the SHP2 portfolio. Meanwhile, Jacobio will continue to conduct early global clinical trials of JAB-3068 and JAB-3312 inhibitors, while AbbVie will cover the R&D expenses.SHP2 is a protein mediator of cellular signaling. Many tumors have genetic mutations, driving abnormal cancer cell growth which relies on SHP2 activity. SHP2 also plays a key role to control cytokine production and immune cell response.Therefore, inhibition of SHP2 is believed to have dual effects by potentially reducing cancer cell growth and modulating immune responses to generate anti-tumor activities. Jacobio's early clinical stage SHP2 assets, JAB-3068 and JAB-3312, are oral small molecules designed to specifically inhibit SHP2 activity.""Identifying promising new targeted approaches for solid tumor patients is a high priority for us,"" said Mohit Trikha, vice president at AbbVie. ""Jacobio's SHP2 program has the potential to treat cancer patients across many tumor types.  By targeting a key node in both cancer and immune cell signaling pathways, SHP2 inhibition, both as a monotherapy and potentially in combination with other agents, may rapidly advance new treatment options for cancer patients.""Upon completion of the trials, AbbVie will be in charge of global development and commercialization. Jacobio has an option, exercisable before the initiation of registrational trials, to exclusively develop and commercialize the SHP2 program in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.The partnership is still subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.Since March 23, AbbVie shares have jumped 44% on the back of its recent acquisition of Botox maker Allergan and solid revenues of Humira, the company’s successful immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory drug. However with an expired patent, competition is growing.Five-star analyst Geoff Meacham at BofA Merrill Lynch last month reinstated coverage of AbbVie with a Hold rating and a $95 price target citing the “uncertainty of top-line resiliency given Humira's impending 2022 loss of exclusivity”.The analyst, who expects a 1% sales decline through 2021-2025, argues that AbbVie stock fairly reflects the headwinds from Humira offset by the Allergan new product portfolio.Overall, Wall Street analysts are more upbeat about AbbVie’s stock outlook. In a review of 9 analysts, the stock scores 7 Buys and the rest are Holds adding up to a Strong Buy consensus. The $102.29 average price target indicates another 10% upside potential in the coming 12 months.

2020-06-02,"The market's violent rebound since the March 23 lows has been a welcome relief for long-term shareholders and a boon for dip buyers. But one group of investors has actually been put out by the rally: income investors looking to put dry powder to work in high-dividend stocks.As the S&P; 500 has crashed and recovered, its yield has whipsawed. The blue-chip index yielded roughly 1.8% to start 2020, jumped all the way to 2.3% as of March, and has dipped back below 2%. That might not sound like much, but remember: That's the average among 500 large-cap companies. The swings across the broader stock market have been much more pronounced, and several high-yield dividend opportunities have disappeared as a result.Several ... but not all.Hundreds of high-dividend stocks still deliver payouts of more than 5%. The problem is that some of those dividends belong to distressed companies that might not be able to continue funding their ample cash distributions.One way to protect yourself is to prioritize signs of dividend health, using the DIVCON system from exchange-traded fund provider Reality Shares. DIVCON uses a five-tier rating to provide a snapshot of companies' dividend health. DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase, while DIVCON 1 signals the highest probability for a cut. Within each of these ratings is a composite score determined by free cash flow-to-dividend ratios, profit growth, stock buybacks (which companies can pull back on to fund a dividend in a pinch) and other factors.Here are seven high-dividend stocks that have been identified for their payout strength. Nothing is certain, of course - so far this year, a few companies with well-funded distributions nonetheless pulled the plug to ensure their survival throughout the pandemic. Still, each stock has a rating of DIVCON 4, which signals a healthy dividend not just likely to survive, but to grow.

2020-06-02,"COVID-19 coronavirus made us realize that health should always be our top priority. Here are some companies working to make the world a better place after the pandemic. AbbVie Inc - Botox To The Rescue With unappreciated potential, the stock of this big drugmaker has stellar fundamentals. AbbVie Inc's (NYSE: ABBV) acquisition of Allergan brought the company over 120 additional products that generated more than $16 billion in revenues last year.There were a few bumps along the way, but AbbVie now has Botox, and sales are growing in cosmetics and therapeutics.J&J - Active On All Fronts Although Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)'s share price is nearly where it was at the start of the year, there are many reasons why this stock is an 'evergreen' favorite. To start, it is the largest healthcare company in the world with tremendous resources.In March, it committed more than $1 billion to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. It is also setting up a manufacturing capacity to produce the vaccine even before clinical trials take place by September. The vaccine could be available for emergency use authorization by 2021 if all goes well, but its scientists are exploring the potential for existing drugs to treat COVID-19.One of the main reasons that this stock has been a favorite among investors is its diversification across the healthcare sector with three business segments. The company's pharmaceutical segment is its biggest growth driver but the other two segments, consumer health, and medical devices are also multibillion-dollar businesses.Merck - Entering The COVID-19 Arena Merck & Co Inc (NYSE: MRK) announced 3 deals to find new medicines and vaccines to help combat the coronavirus. What is also positive is that Merck grew its EBIT by 29% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt.Roche - Combining Drugs To Fight COVID-19 Roche Holding AG (OTC: RHHBY) announced it plans to test whether mixing the anti-inflammation drug Actemra, with anti-viral treatment remdesivir, might give better results in treating severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia than remdesivir alone.Roche is hoping that by combining the two in a global study of 450 hospitalized patients worldwide, it will be able to offer doctors a one-two punch against the enemy that took 360,000 lives as it quickly contaminated 5.8 million people.Everyone is fighting for the same goal - and the world is cheering for them to reach the finish line as soon as possible!This article is not a press release and is contributed by Ivana Popovic who is a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-06-02,"Drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV) has announced that it has submitted applications for a new indication for Rinvoq (upadacitinib; 15 mg, once daily) for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.The applications were submitted to both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).“Psoriatic arthritis is a complex heterogeneous disease with manifestations across multiple domains, including joints and skin, causing daily pain, fatigue and stiffness,” said Michael Severino of AbbVie. “We look forward to working with regulatory authorities and hope to bring RINVOQ to people living with this debilitating disease as quickly as possible.”The applications are supported by data from two Phase 3 studies across a broad range of more than 2,000 patients with active psoriatic arthritis. In both studies, Rinvoq, a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor, met the primary endpoint of ACR20 response at week 12 versus placebo. It also achieved non-inferiority versus adalimumab in terms of ACR20 response at week 12.Overall, the safety profile of the treatment in psoriatic arthritis was consistent with previously reported results across the Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis clinical trial program, with no new significant safety risks detected.In 2019, Rinvoq received both US and European approval for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Meanwhile Phase 3 trials of Rinvoq are ongoing for a number of other diseases including axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn’s disease, atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis and giant cell arteritis.Overall, Wall Street analysts are upbeat about the prospects for AbbVie. In a review of 9 analysts, the stock scores 7 Buys and the rest are Holds adding up to a Strong Buy consensus. The $102.29 average price target indicates 13% upside potential in the coming 12 months. Shares are currently trading up 2.5% year-to-date.

2020-06-02,"After several postponed decisions, Mylan Inc (MYL) has announced that it is moving forward with a Botox biosimilar development program in collaboration with Revance Therapeutics (RVNC). On the news MYL rose 3% in Monday’s trading, RVNC was up 4%, and Botox owner AbbVie (ABBV) fell 2%.Feedback from the U.S. FDA in February 2019 indicated that the 351(k) regulatory pathway for an onabotulinumtoxinA product is viable, Revance said. Based on this meeting, along with the results from additional characterization and analysis, the two companies are now proceeding with the development program.“We are excited to move forward with Revance on a clear and achievable development pathway for what will potentially be the first biosimilar to BOTOX” said Mylan President Rajiv Malik. “This collaboration adds another high-profile, large-market, complex biologic, across both aesthetic and therapeutic categories, to our industry-leading biosimilars pipeline.”Mylan and Revance signed a collaboration and license agreement in February 2018 for to develop a Botox biosimilar, with commercialization by Mylan. The agreement included an upfront payment of $25 million to Revance, and was extended for $5 million in 2019.With Mylan’s decision to move forward, Mylan will now pay $30 million to Revance. The agreement also allows for up to $70 million in milestone payments to RVNC alongside sales target milestone payments and royalties.“In all, we don’t think this is surprising as the program has been in the works for some time” comments RBC Capital analyst Randall Stanicky. “MYL has since been focused on getting additional clarity on FDA’s regulatory expectations. The decision to now move forward thus implies that MYL is reasonably confident it can meet those expectations” he said.However the analyst does not see this coming before 2025, writing, “there are still regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome, and we do not expect a biosimilar BOTOX.”That said, this decision has out-year competitive considerations for ABBV should MYL/RVNC ultimately succeed (global BOTOX sales are >7% of total 2021E revenue for ABBV), the analyst points out.""But there are significant technical hurdles that need to be overcome and this is not a near-term event… We expect some focus to remain here, and it will add some headline to watch but it is not a near-term threat [to ABBV]” he concludes.Stanicky has a buy rating on MYL with a price target of $26 (45% upside potential). He also reiterated a buy rating on ABBV with a $102 price target (12% upside potential).Overall, MYL has a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus while Revance scores a more bullish Strong Buy Street consensus. The $28 average analyst price target for Revance indicates 30% upside potential lies ahead.

The two companies said that they will also collaborate on research to develop future differentiated antibody therapeutics for cancer.As part of the partnership they will develop Genmab’s next-generation bispecific antibody programs, epcoritamab (DuoBody-CD3xCD20), DuoHexaBody-CD37 and DuoBody-CD3x5T4.“Epcoritamab is a strong fit for our robust hematological oncology franchise”, said Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President at AbbVie. “By combining the strengths of our two organizations, we can advance the treatment landscape for patients battling cancer.”Under the financial terms of the collaboration, AbbVie will pay Genmab $750 million in an upfront payment with the potential for Genmab to receive up to $3.15 billion in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments for all programs. The financial terms also include tiered royalties of between 22% and 26% on epcoritamab net sales outside the U.S. and Japan.Except for these royalty-bearing sales, the parties will share pre-tax profits from the sale of products on a 50:50 basis. Included in these potential milestones are up to $1.15 billion in payments related to clinical development and commercial success across the three existing bispecific antibody programs.In addition, if all four next-generation antibody product candidates are successfully developed as a result of the research collaboration, then Genmab will get up to $2 billion in option exercise and success-based milestone payments.As a result of the agreement, Genmab is raising its 2020 financial guidance for revenues to be in the range of DKK 9,100 - DKK 9,500 million, an increase of DKK 4,350 million compared to its previous guidance.Genmab shares have been on a steady winning streak since mid-March and are up 29% so far this year. AbbVie was little changed in pre-market trading after advancing 1.7% to $96.17 on Tuesday.SunTrust analyst Asthika Goonewardene this month increased the Genmab’s price target to $36 (25% upside potential) from $30 and maintained a Buy rating, citing the company's pipeline and platform.Goonewardene sees strong potential for epcoritamab as a leading CD20 T-cell engager and noted that the antibody platform ""is indeed quite remarkable"", with potential to generate a large number of drug candidates and efficiently screen to ""find several lead assets per target/mechanism"".The rest of the Wall Street analyst community agrees with Goonewardene as the stock scores 5 Buy ratings backing up a Strong Buy consensus. The $31.75 average price target implies shares may advance another 10% over the coming year.

In 2020, it is estimated there will be nearly 20,000 new cases of AML diagnosed in the US, with many older AML patients unable to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy treatment.Results from the VIALE-A study showed that the Venclexta combination reduced the risk of death (overall survival [OS]) by 34% compared to azacitidine alone (median OS=14.7 months vs. 9.6 months; HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.52–0.85, p&lt;0.001) in people with previously untreated AML.The Venclexta plus azacitidine combination also led to higher rates of composite complete remission (CR + CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CR + CRi]) at 66.4% compared to 28.3% with azacitidine alone (p&lt;0.001).Safety for Venclexta plus azacitidine appeared consistent with the known safety profile of these medicines and no unexpected safety signals were identified with the combination.The study also met its secondary endpoint of CR and CR with partial hematologic recovery (CR + CRh), with the combination showing a CR + CRh of 64.7% compared to 22.8% with azacitidine alone.Venclexta has previously been granted accelerated approval by the FDA in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of people with newly diagnosed AML aged 75 years or older, or for those ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy.The 433-person VIALE-A study is part of Venclexta’s ongoing development program to convert the current accelerated approval to a full approval. Venclexta has also been granted five Breakthrough Therapy Designations by the FDA, including two for previously untreated AML.Venclexta is jointly commercialized by both AbbVie and Roche in the United States and by AbbVie outside of the United States. It is a first-in-class targeted medicine designed to selectively bind and inhibit the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein.Shares in ABBV are currently trading up 4% year-to-date, and analysts have a bullish Strong Buy outlook on the stock with 11 recent buy ratings vs 2 hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $105 translates into 14% upside potential from current levels. (See ABBV stock analysis on TipRanks)On June 10 RBC Capital’s Randall Stanicky reiterated his AbbVie buy rating and $102 price target following news of the Genmab (GMAB) collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize three of GMAB's early-stage investigational bispecific antibody product candidates.“While a balance sheet friendly add to hematology /oncology, the growth story forming on the other side of HUMIRA is under-appreciated and has potential to drive valuation re-rating” he commented.Related News:  Medtronic Succeeds In Critical US Trial For New Insulin Pump  Genmab Shares Rise 5% In Pre-Market On Oncology Partnership With AbbVie  Sorrento Edges Higher On Debt Repayment As Top Analyst Says Buy More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Shopify Teams Up With Blackberry On Canadian Covid-19 App   * Marathon- Speedway Sale Reportedly Back In Play; RBC Says Deal ‘Clear Positive’   * T-Mobile Declares $4 Billion Sale Of Senior Secured Notes   * DraftKings Reveals Pricing, Upsizing of $1.6B Public Offering","AbbVie, Roche’s AML Therapy Shows Significant Survival Benefits"

2020-07-02,"AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock is both cheap and has a very attractive dividend yield. In addition, this pharmaceutical company's growth prospects are high, now that its purchase of Allergan is closed.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com For example, the stock trades on a forward earnings ratio of just 9.2 times 2020 expected earnings. It is even lower with 2021 earnings prospects.In addition, the $4.72 per share annual dividend is very attractive to most investors for several reasons. For one, the dividend yield for ABBV stock is much higher than the average stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSecondly, the dividend is likely to keep on growing at a nice pace. For example, on June 17 AbbVie declared a $1.18 quarterly dividend for the third time. After the fourth quarterly dividend at this rate, I suspect the company will raise the dividend in Q4. According to Seeking Alpha, AbbVie has had a 20.86% dividend growth rate annually on a compounded basis.  * 7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring DividendsLastly, the dividend is still well covered by the company's earnings. For example, Seeking Alpha's poll of 15 analysts' estimates of 2020 is $10.46 per share. But the dividend rate right now is $4.72. So the dividend is more than 100% covered by earnings. Why Is AbbVie Stock So Cheap?AbbVie's main revenue driver, up until its recent acquisition of Allergan, was Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis drug. It also acts as an anti-inflammatory drug for other conditions including Crohn's disease, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, etc. It is the world's best-selling drug.But adalimubab, the actual name of the drug, went off-patent in 2016. Recently, generic versions of the drug have become available.The problem for AbbVie is that up until Q1 2020, Humira accounted for 54.5% of its revenue. AbbVie said its Q1 sales were $8.619 billion, up 10.7% year-over-year. But Humira sales were $4.703 billion, up 6.4%.This is the most likely reason for AbbVie's low valuation. It is too reliant on one drug and that drug is now off-patent. The market assumes that generic drugs will eventually overtake that revenue stream for AbbVie. But things are not as bad as that. Why Investors Need Not Be So WorriedFirst of all, Humira does not go completely off-patent in the U.S., even though in some other countries this has happened. Its core U.S. patents went off-patent in 2016, but it has a &quot;patent thicket&quot; that extends its exclusivity to as late as 2034, according to one source. Another source says its exclusivity extends to 2023.Second, the company will now have a much lower reliance on Humira. On May 8, AbbVie closed on its acquisition of Allergan for about $63 billion in cash and stock. Allergan made $3.6 billion in sales in its latest quarter and $378 million in profits.So you can see that on a pro-forma combined basis, Humira will now account for a lower amount of total sales. They would total $12.2 billion on a combined basis in Q1. But Humira's $4.7 billion would account for only 38.4%. Given that other drugs in the portfolio are likely growing faster than Humira, that portion will continue to fall.So the risk is falling for the over-reliance on one drug. But some analysts point out that AbbVie's other drugs and its pipeline are very attractive as growth drivers. Valuing AbbVie StockGiven that management clearly seems intent on growing its dividend, we can use this aspect of the return of capital to value AbbVie stock. Let's assume the dividend next rises 10% next year, just like it did this year. That would put the annual dividend at $5.20 per share.The historical dividend yield for AbbVie stock has been 4.22% over the past four years, according to Seeking Alpha. Therefore, by taking the $5.20 dividend per share and dividing it by 4.22%, the target price is $123.22 per shareThat represents a significant gain over the current price of about $98. So not only is AbbVie stock cheap with an attractive dividend yield, but it also has good upside potential.Mark Hake runs the Total Yield Value Guide which you can review here.

2020-07-20,"AbbVie’s (ABBV) Allergan has told Molecular Partners that it will withdraw application filings with both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Japanese Regulatory Agency (PMDA) for Abicipar pegol, a novel DARPin therapeutic for patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when a part of the retina called the macula is damaged, resulting in disturbance to the central visual field. Wet nAMD is less common but much more serious than dry AMD. Wet AMD is when new, abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina, causing scarring of the macula.In June 26, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected the Biologics License Application (BLA) for Abicipar pegol.According to the FDA’s Complete Response Letter, the rate of intraocular inflammation observed following administration of Abicipar pegol 2mg/0.05 mL resulted in an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio in the treatment of nAMD.“We continue to believe in the need for treatment options that provide patients with reliable vision gains and less frequent dosing for the treatment of nAMD,” said Michael R. Robinson of Ophthalmology at AbbVie. “We are committed to working with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for Abicipar pegol.”The global need for eye health services is projected to increase dramatically in the coming decades, said AbbVie, posing a considerable challenge to healthcare systems.“Through building a strong, active pipeline, which is focused on significant unmet needs in eye care, AbbVie is committed to developing and delivering sustainable solutions that make a remarkable impact on people’s lives” the company stated.Allergan in-licensed exclusive global rights to the candidate from Molecular Partners in 2012 in a deal worth up to $420M.Shares in AbbVie are trading up 14% year-to-date, and the stock has a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus. Indeed out of 14 analysts covering the stock, only one is staying on the sidelines. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $110 indicates 9% further upside potential lies ahead. (See ABBV stock analysis on TipRanks)“Our investment thesis on ABBV is based on our view that the company will generate double-digit near-term growth on the back of P&L catch-up in 2021 and strength of core franchises” commented RBC Capital analyst Randall Stanicky.He has a buy rating on the stock and $125 price target, arguing “While we see a step-down in 2023 upon HUMIRA biosimilar entry, it should be manageable with growth off of that trough year beyond.

This is for earnings estimated for fiscal year 2021, and it is very cheap.  * 10 Cybersecurity Stocks We Need Now More Than Ever That said, the five high yield drug stocks are:  * AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)  * GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)  * Novartis (NYSE:NVS)  * Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)  * Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)So, with all of that in mind, let's dive in. High-Yield Drug Stocks: AbbVie (ABBV)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $170 billionForward P/E: 8.3xDividend Yield: 4.8%Target Price Upside: 87%AbbVie stock is a large $170 billion market capitalization drug stock that is both cheap and has a very attractive dividend yield. In addition, its growth prospects are high. In fact, it recently closed on the $63 billion acquisition of Allergan.Allergan is well known for its Botox and other beauty products. In turn, the deal will help AbbVie diversify its earnings and &quot;buys time&quot; before its arthritis drug Humira goes off-patent in 2023.Overall, that is why AbbVie is so cheap. It accounted for over 54% of the company's sales as of first quarter of FY2020. The market assumes that generic drugs will eventually overtake that revenue stream for AbbVie, but things are not as bad as that.With Allergan, Humira will account for only 38.4% of sales. And given that other drugs in AbbVie's portfolio are likely growing faster than Humira, that portion will continue to fall.Moreover, ABBV stock has a history of paying consistent quarterly dividends that tend to rise each year. You can see this in the chart here.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 81% more than today's price.For example, the company's historical yield over the last four years is 4.22%. Given today's yield of 4.8%, that implies AbbVie stock is worth almost 15% more than today.Also, based on its historical P/E ratio, the stock is worth over double today's price. And lastly, based on a comparison with its peers, the stock should have an 80% higher price.  Averaging these three methods, AbbVie stock is worth $182.30, or 87% more than today.Therefore, ABBV stock is one of the top drug stocks available. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $100 billionForward P/E: 13.8xDividend Yield: 4.5%Target Price Upside: 24%GlaxoSmithKline is the world's largest vaccine maker, and the UK-headquartered company is relying on proven methods of making a vaccine.  In fact, Reuters says it prefers the &quot;slow and steady approach of focusing on an established technology that has the best chance of reaching the widest possible demographic.&quot;They recognize that the world will need billions of doses, and therefore are not worried if they are first to market with a vaccine. Many other vaccine makers will not have the capacity to match what GlaxoSmithKline can do quickly. And once its vaccine is ready -- which, only started its trials in June -- it can make large amounts.AAdditionally, GlaxoSmithKline believes its vaccine will have better efficacy and last longer. This may mean it can work better with the elderly.As Barron's points out, the company has a huge pipeline of drugs, including options for cancer and HIV prevention. GlaxoSmithKline also plans on spinning off its consumer health division, which makes Advil and Panadol.Moreover, GSK stock has a history of paying consistent quarterly dividends that tend to have a higher year-end dividend each year. You can see this is true in the chart here.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA So, based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 24% more than today's price.For example, the company's historical price-to-earnings over the last four years is 25 times. Given today's P/E ratio of 14 times this year and 13.8 times next year, that implies GSK stock is worth almost 84% more than today.And lastly, based on a comparison with its peers, the stock should be much higher. Averaging three valuations methods, GSK stock is worth $51.51, or 24% more than today.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks Ready for Big Growth Collectively, GSK stock is another one to keep your eye on. Novartis (NVS)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $194 billionForward P/E: 14.1xDividend Yield: 3.6%Target Price Upside: 17%Novartis, a Swiss company, owns Sandoz, a well-known drug company. Sandoz plans on giving away 15 of its generic drugs that treat symptoms of COVID-19 to developing countries. In June, it agreed to $729 million in fines with the U.S. government to settle charges it paid kickbacks to doctors and patients.Moreover, Novartis will start a Covid-19 clinical trial of their cancer drug, Jakafi, which was developed by Incyte Corp.(NASDAQ:INCY). In turn, Novartis sells the drug outside the U.S. Barron's recently described the use of this cancer drug for a Covid-19 trial, and how Jakafi could help patients suffering severe immune overreactions caused by Covid-19.Novartis and Incyte have a Phase 3 trial, comparing those who use it with Covid-19 and those with Covid-19 who don't. The drug could eliminate hospital intensive care and mechanical breathing assistance. In fact, this drug is one of many in the category of existing drugs that could potentially act as a treatment for Covid-19.Investors should also consider its attractive 3.6% dividend yield. NVS stock has consistently paid annual dividends that reflect its profitability,and you can see this in the chart.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Therefore, based on my analysis, it is worth at least 17% more than today's price.For example, its historical price-to-earnings over the last four years is 21 times. And given today's P/E ratio of 14 times this year, NVS stock is worth almost 46% more than today.Finally, based on a comparison with its peers, the stock should be much higher. Averaging three valuations methods, NVS stock is worth $100.62, or 17% more than today -- making NVS stock another great drug stock. Pfizer (PFE)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $204 billionForward P/E: 11.8xDividend Yield: 4.1%Target Price Upside: 34%Pfizer recently indicated that its Covid-19 vaccine trials will be rolled out very quickly. On that note, Barron's reported that analysts believe the aggressive timeline was &quot;laudable, but seems challenging.&quot; One analyst believes that the positive vaccine data and the trial timeline will act as a &quot;catalyst&quot; for PFE stock.Moreover, Pfizer is working in collaboration with a German company, BioNtech (NASDAQ:BNTX), on this vaccine. And according to Barron's, all 24 patients who received lower doses of the vaccine developed levels of neutralizing antibodies after 28 days. These levels were about two times higher than those found in patients who have recovered from the coronavirus.On July 13, the FDA gave the companies' vaccine trial a &quot;fast track&quot; status. The two vaccines, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, could get &quot;priority review&quot; leading to approval within six months. By comparison, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) which uses similar technology, according to Reuters, got this fast track status in May.Nevertheless, this could why PFE stock has been rising. There are also valuation-related reasons to buy the stock.PFE stock has a history of paying consistent quarterly dividends that tend to rise each year. You can see this in the chart here.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 34% more than today's price.For example, its historical yield over the last four years is 3.77%. And given today's yield of 4.1%, PFE stock is worth almost 10% more than today.  * 4 Underappreciated Tech Stocks to Buy Now Before They Rise Averaging three valuation methods PFE stock is worth $49.15, or 34% more than today. Sanofi (SNY)  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA Market Value: $134 billionForward P/E: 14.4xDividend Yield: 3.2%Target Price Upside: 29%Sanofi is also in the Covid-19 vaccine race as well. In late June, Sanofi partnered with another company, Translate Bio (NASDAQ:TBIO). The companies have worked together before, and use a messenger RNA technology like Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech for their Covid-19 vaccine drug. In turn, this technology induces antibodies for a specific protein related to the novel coronavirus.Also, Sanofi's Pasteur division is going to spend $1.9 billion to get a vaccine by mid-2021, with trials are expected to start in Q4. Therefore, Sanofi offers both capital and a huge vaccine manufacturing capability to Translate Bio.Moreover, SNY stock has a history of paying consistent annual dividends that reflect its profitability each year. You can see this in the given chart.  Click to EnlargeSource: Mark R. Hake, CFA So, based on my analysis of the stock, it is worth at least 29% more than today's price.For example, its historical price-to-earnings over the last four years is 40 times. Given today's P/E ratio of 35 times this year and 14.4 times next year, SNY stock is worth almost 43% more than today.Lastly, based on a comparison with its peers, SNY stock should be 6 to 7% higher. Averaging three valuations methods, SNY stock is worth $68.80, or 29% more than today. And with all of that in mind, PFE is one of the best drug stocks on the market. Summary: High Yield Drug StocksThese high yield drug stocks are admirable in that most of them are developing Covid-19 vaccines. In addition, they also have attractive dividends with attractive upside potential.Source: Mark R. Hake, CFA Overall, these are not day trades or momentum stocks. On the other hand, though, they are solidly profitable and can afford their high-yield dividends. They are likely to reach their target upside.Moreover, this chart sows that the average dividend yield is 4.1% for this group of stocks. They also boast a low average P/E at 12.5 times, and offer a potential upside of almost 38%. That is a very respectable ROI for most investors.Therefore, for these reasons, these five high-yielding drug stocks could be great options for investors.Mark Hake runs the Total Yield Value Guide which you can review here. The Guide focuses on high total yield value stocks.

2020-07-31,"Shares of AbbVie Inc.  were up 1.9% in premarket trading on Thursday after the drugmaker beat expectations for the quarter. The company had a loss of $739 million, or 46 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2020. It had reported a gain of $807 million, or 49 cents a share, in the same quarter in 2019. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.34, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $2.20. Sales increased to $10.4 billion in the quarter compared with $8.2 billion in the period a year ago. The FactSet consensus for revenue for the quarter was $9.9 billion. The increase in sales was driven in part by strong performance from its immunology business, which includes its top-selling drug, Humira. The immunology business saw revenue rise by 8.1% to $5.1 billion over the last three months. AbbVie in early May closed its acquisition of Allergan; it also said that sales of the cosmetic filler Botox, a longtime Allergan brand, tumbled 43.1% to $226 million as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2020-08-25,"AbbVie to pay Morphic license fee of $20 million, with future potential milestones and royaltiesAbbVie to lead further development and commercialization WALTHAM, Mass., Aug. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Morphic Therapeutic (NASDAQ: MORF), a biopharmaceutical company developing a new generation of oral integrin therapies for the treatment of serious chronic diseases, and AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) today announced that AbbVie has exercised a license option under the companies’ research and development collaboration agreement to develop Morphic’s αvβ6 integrin inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and additional indications. The αvβ6 integrin activates transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a key driver of tissue fibrosis. The license covers αvβ6 integrin specific inhibitors discovered from Morphic’s proprietary MInT Platform, including the compounds MORF-720 and MORF-627, which are supported by an extensive preclinical data package demonstrating potential as treatments for IPF as well as other fibrotic diseases. Pursuant to the agreement between Morphic and AbbVie, Morphic will receive a license fee of $20 million, with potential future development milestone payments and royalties from the sales of any commercialized candidates.“The preclinical data strongly support Morphic’s selective small molecule inhibitors of αvβ6 for development in fibrotic disease. AbbVie has been an excellent partner through the preclinical development of this program and we believe that their decision to assume leadership for the next stages of development is a strong vote of confidence in our collaboration, as well as Morphic’s MInT platform to generate orally available integrin inhibitors,” said Praveen Tipirneni, MD, president and chief executive officer of Morphic Therapeutic.About the Morphic-AbbVie Agreement  Under the terms of the original agreement, AbbVie paid Morphic an upfront payment of $100 million for exclusive license options on product candidates directed at multiple targets. For each target, Morphic will conduct R&D activities through the completion of IND-enabling studies, at which point AbbVie may pay a license fee to exercise its exclusive license option and assume responsibility for global development and commercialization. Morphic is also eligible for additional, undisclosed clinical and commercial milestone payments and tiered royalties on worldwide net sales for each compound. Morphic retains cost-sharing rights in the development of liver fibrosis indications, and may opt into paying a percentage of AbbVie’s development costs in exchange for enhanced royalties. About Fibrosis and TGF-β  Fibrosis occurs when chronic inflammation or persistent injury leads to the development of excessive connective tissue, which can lead to organ damage and impaired function. Fibrotic diseases can affect nearly all tissues and organ systems and, due to limited treatment options, can cause serious illness and death.The pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-β is a key regulator of fibrosis, but attempts to globally suppress its activity have suffered from a narrow therapeutic index (dose-limiting toxicity). Several integrins, such as αvβ6, play a dominant role in local activation of TGF-β in diseased tissues. Inhibition of these integrins is therefore a compelling strategy for treating chronic fibrotic diseases with significant advantage over global TGF-β inhibitors.About Morphic Therapeutic  Morphic Therapeutic is a biopharmaceutical company developing a new generation of oral integrin therapies for the treatment of serious chronic diseases, including autoimmune, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, fibrosis and cancer. In collaboration with AbbVie, Janssen, and Schrödinger, Morphic is advancing its pipeline and discovery activities using its proprietary MInT technology platform which leverages the Company’s unique understanding of integrin structure and biology.

2020-08-26,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a wake-up call for governments, as they realize the significant investment required by the healthcare sector. Billions of dollars are now being invested to develop a treatment for coronavirus. Meanwhile, lockdowns impacted the demand for certain drugs due to a decline in doctor visits and prescriptions filled. Also, elective procedures are being delayed.We will discuss how two leading drugmakers AbbVie and Biogen are faring amid the pandemic and using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.AbbVie (ABBV)For a long time biopharmaceutical company AbbVie, which was formed in 2013 as a result of its spin-off from Abbott, banked on its blockbuster immunology drug Humira. But, Humira started losing its grip over international markets due to competition from biosimilars in Europe. The drug still accounted for 58% of AbbVie’s 2019 revenue. Humira continues to grow in the US market, where it will lose patent exclusivity in 2023.AbbVie completed its $63 billion acquisition of Allergan in May as part of its plans to diversify beyond Humira. The addition of Allergan, especially its Botox franchise, was supposed to boost AbbVie’s second-quarter sales. But COVID-19 ruined AbbVie’s plans.AbbVie’s second-quarter revenue grew 26.3% Y/Y to $10.4 billion due to the inclusion of Allergan. However, on a comparable operational basis (which assumes for calculation purposes that Allergan acquisition closed on January 1, 2019), the company’s revenue fell 5.3% mainly due to the impact of the pandemic on Allergan.Notably, Botox Cosmetic revenues declined 43.1% to $226 million, while Botox Therapeutic revenues fell 22.3% to $297 million. And sales for Allergan’s eye-care drug Restasis dropped 19.5% to $138 million. However, its anti-psychotic drug Vraylar delivered sales of $192 million, marking a 70.4% growth.Meanwhile, Humira’s second-quarter revenues fell 0.7% (reported basis) to $4.84 billion as biosimilar competition led to a 19.9% fall in international sales. Humira’s US sales grew 4.8% to $3.97 billion.Beyond Humira, AbbVie is seeking growth through its oncology drugs Imbruvica and Venclexta. In the second quarter, Imbruvica’s (Johnson & Johnson has non-US marketing rights) revenues grew 17.2% to $1.29 billion. Venclexta’s revenues of $303 million reflected a 79.2% rise in a reported basis.AbbVie’s new immunology drugs are also looking promising. Psoriasis drug Skyrizi delivered $330 million and rheumatoid arthritis drug Rinvoq’s revenues were $149 million in the second quarter.AbbVie’s second-quarter adjusted EPS increased 3.5% Y/Y to $2.34. Including the results from Allergen, AbbVie now expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $10.35 to $10.45 compared to its previous guidance in the range of $9.61 to $9.71.On August 25, AbbVie filed for FDA approval for Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis. It also intends to file for regulatory approval for Atogepant in treating migraine after positive phase 3 results.AbbVie has partnered with Harbour BioMed, Utrecht University and Erasmus Medical Center for developing a treatment for COVID-19. In June, the company inked a deal with Genmab to develop cancer treatments. (See ABBV stock analysis on TipRanks)On August 20, Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger increased his price target for AbbVie to $108 from $95 and maintained his Buy rating. Risinger cited strong financial momentum, uptake of new launches and prospects for long-term multiple expansions as the reasons for the price target upgrade.The Street shows its confidence in AbbVie with its Strong Buy consensus based on 12 Buys and no Holds or Sells. A price target of $112.63 implies an upside potential of about 20%. AbbVie stock has risen 6% so far in 2020.Biogen (BIIB)Biogen received a major setback when it lost a patent dispute with Mylan (MYL) for blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera. This means that Tecfidera might now face competition from generics. Tecfidera accounted for 40% of Biogen’s product revenues in 2019 and 42% in the second quarter of 2020.On August 19, Mylan announced the launch of its first generic to Biogen’s Tecfidera. However, it is a launch-at-risk since the litigation between Mylan and Biogen is ongoing.Piper Sandler analyst Christopher Raymond said that he is &quot;incrementally cautious&quot; on Biogen following the launch of Mylan’s generic version to Tecfidera. Raymond has a Hold rating for Biogen with a $270 price target.There has also been controversy with regard to Biogen’s potential Alzheimer's drug aducanumab. The company had discontinued the development of this drug in March 2019 as it failed to prove effective in treating Alzheimer’s in phase 3 clinical trial. However, Biogen changed its stance on aducanumab in October 2019 and said that the earlier analysis was incorrect as it was based on a smaller dataset.On August 7, the company announced that the FDA has accepted Biogen and Eisai’s license application for aducanumab with priority review.Meanwhile, Biogen delivered better-than-anticipated results for the second quarter. Biogen’s second-quarter revenue rose 2% Y/Y $3.68 billion. The quarter’s adjusted EPS rose 12% to $10.26.Tecfidera revenue increased 3% Y/Y to $1.18 billion. Sales from spinal muscular atrophy Spinraza rose only 1% to $495 million perhaps due to increased competition as Novartis’s Zolgensma was approved last year. Overall, Biogen’s total product revenues declined 3% to $2.80 billion, including a 7% fall in biosimilar revenues.But, Biogen’s second-quarter top-line benefited from $208 million in Ocrevus royalties from Roche, which increased 14% Y/Y. Also, other revenues rose 155% to $408 million mainly driven by revenue from the licensing of certain manufacturing-related intellectual property to one of the company’s corporate partners. (See BIIB stock analysis on TipRanks)Biogen stock has declined 6.0% year-to-date. An average price target of $316.05 indicates an upside potential of 13.3% in Biogen stock. The Street has a Hold consensus that breaks down into 10 buys, 16 Holds, and 3 Sells.So, AbbVie or Biogen?AbbVie’s higher debt levels and lower operating margin compared to Biogen go against it. But, it is notable that AbbVie rewards shareholders through dividends while Biogen makes no dividend payments. AbbVie has an impressive dividend yield of 5.0%.Overall, dividends, strong sales growth prospects supported by Allergan acquisition, analysts’ bullish stance and higher upside potential makes us choose AbbVie over Biogen.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-09-04,"Over the past three months, shares of AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) decreased by 4.00%. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt AbbVie has.AbbVie's Debt According to the AbbVie's most recent balance sheet as reported on August 4, 2020, total debt is at $87.43 billion, with $82.06 billion in long-term debt and $5.37 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $6.02 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $81.42 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. AbbVie has $149.53 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.58. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Earnings Scheduled For July 31, 2020  * A Preview Of AbbVie's Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-09-04,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc. and Chinese drug developer I-Mab agreed to collaborate on a cancer treatment in a deal that could be worth more than $2.9 billion.The deal gives North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie an exclusive global license to develop and sell I-Mab’s cancer-fighting drug outside of Greater China, according to a statement on Friday. The drug lemzoparlimab, also known as TJC4, is an antibody discovered by the Shanghai-based company that is used to treat multiple forms of cancer.AbbVie will pay I-Mab $180 million up front as well as $20 million based on recently-released clinical data, according to the statement. I-Mab could also receive as much as $1.74 billion in milestone payments based on development, regulatory and sales criteria. The Chinese firm will get royalties from future sales of the drug.The partnership also gives AbbVie a right of first negotiation to license further development and sales of two other lemzoparlimab-based antibodies developed by I-Mab. The potential combined value would be at least $1 billion in upfront and milestone payments.Separately, I-Mab also announced that a consortium led by Hillhouse Capital has agreed to invest $418 million through a private placement. The deal includes an offering of 29.1 million ordinary shares to the investors at a price equivalent to $33 for each of I-Mab’s American depositary shares, according to another statement. The placement will also see the issue of warrants worth an additional $104.5 million if fully exercised. Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte participated in the offering as well.I-Mab jumped as much as 17.9% to a record $42.16 each in New York trading on Friday, while AbbVie rose as much as 1.4%.I-Mab, which raised $114 million in a U.S. initial public offering in January, had been seeking a partner to jointly develop and sell lemzoparlimab in the world’s biggest economy, Bloomberg News first reported in April.The therapy targets a “do-not-eat-me” signal that allows cancer cells to avoid being targeted by the patient’s own immune system, according to I-Mab’s website. The drug blocks the signal, allowing the immune system to engulf and eradicate the malignant cells.I-Mab’s deal with AbbVie is the latest large transaction in one of the hottest areas of pharmaceutical research: cancer treatments that harness the immune system to fight tumors. Earlier this year, Gilead Sciences Inc. completed the acquisition of immuno-oncology firm Forty Seven Inc. for about $4.9 billion.In June, AbbVie agreed a cancer research and development pact with Danish biotechnology company Genmab A/S that may generate payments of more than $3 billion.Jefferies LLC is the lead placement agent on I-Mab’s private placement, and China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. participated as a financial adviser.(Adds share prices in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.",AbbVie Inks $2.9 Billion Cancer Deal With China’s I-Mab
2020-09-04,"AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) has signed a collaboration agreement with Chinese clinical-stage biotechnology company I-Mab (NASDAQ: IMAB) for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab, a monoclonal antibody in early-stage clinical testing that could be used to treat various cancers.  The antibody targets CD47, a protein that is overexpressed on the surface of many types of cancer cells and delivers a ""don't eat me"" signal to the body's immune system.  Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie will pay I-Mab $200 million now and up to $1.74 billion in milestone payments in the future.",AbbVie Partners With I-Mab for Cancer Drug
2020-09-06,"AbbVie announced that it has signed an exclusive global collaboration agreement with I-Mab to develop and sell the Chinese biotech company’s lemzoparlimab drug candidate for the treatment of multiple cancers.Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie (ABBV) will pay I-Mab $180 million in an upfront payment to exclusively license lemzoparlimab, also known as TJC4, along with $20 million in a milestone payment based on the Phase 1 results, for a total of $200 million. I-Mab will be eligible to receive up to $1.74 billion in success-based milestone payments for lemzoparlimab, of which $840 million are based on clinical development and regulatory approval milestones, with the remainder based on commercial milestones.Upon commercialization of lemzoparlimab, AbbVie will also pay tiered royalties from low-to-mid teen percentages on global net sales outside of greater China. In addition, the two partners have the potential to expand the collaboration to additional transformative therapies, they said in the joint statement.Nasdaq-listed I-Mab (IMAB) stock closed 3.6% higher at $37.07 on Friday, while AbbVie was little changed.Lemzoparlimab is one of the main drug candidates among I-Mab's proprietary and innovative pipeline. It is designed to minimize inherent binding to normal red blood cells while preserving its strong anti-tumor activity, a critical attribute in potentially differentiating lemzoparlimab from other antibodies of the same class currently in development, the company said.&quot;Cancer is the second-leading cause of death globally and the need for novel cancer therapies has never been more acute. The addition of I-Mab's novel CD47 programs complements our global clinical strategy in hematology and immuno-oncology,&quot; said AbbVie’s chief scientific officer Thomas J. Hudson. &quot;We have been impressed with what I-Mab has been able to accomplish in research and clinical development and we look forward to working together to make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of patients globally.&quot;I-Mab said results of its recent phase 1 clinical trial confirm possible differentiation of lemzoparlimab in drug safety and a more favorable pharmacokinetics profile in cancer patients. Results have shown that lemzoparlimab is well tolerated as a single agent at a dose range of up to 30 mg/kg without any priming dose. Full data will be presented at an appropriate scientific conference later this year.AbbVie shares have recovered after hitting a low in March and are now trading 3.7% higher than at the start of the year on the back of its acquisition of Botox maker Allergan and solid revenues of Humira. Looking ahead, the $111.38 average analyst price target indicates another 21% upside potential in the coming 12 months.Before the collaboration announcement, Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum last week raised the stock's price target to $105 from $98 and reiterated a Buy rating.Baum believes that the &quot;underappreciated revenue and/or durability&quot; upside from the company's marketed agents Skyrizi, Rinvoq and Imbruvica offsets the current risk from the recently announced congressional subpoena on AbbVie's drug pricing practices.Overall, ABBV scores 11 Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts adding up to a bullish Strong Buy consensus.

Capital gains were a bit easier to achieve in 2016-17, though we note that dividend payments still contributed about 15%-20% of total return for investors. And dividend payments softened the blow in 2018, when most market indices declined as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Between 1930 and 2012, dividend income accounted for 42% of total return of the S&P 500, according to Morgan Stanley.

2020-10-09,"Shares of AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) decreased by 11.15% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt AbbVie has.AbbVie's Debt According to the AbbVie's most recent balance sheet as reported on August 4, 2020, total debt is at $87.43 billion, with $82.06 billion in long-term debt and $5.37 billion in current debt. Adjusting for $6.02 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $81.42 billion.To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering AbbVie's $149.53 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.58. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Why Debt Is Important Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * Options Trades For This Crazy Market: Get Benzinga Options to Follow High-Conviction Trade Ideas  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For September 29, 2020  * A Look Into AbbVie's Debt(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

In addition, with interest rates near zero, fixed income yields are suppressed as well. The end result is that investors have to look deeper for high-yield stocks.
Fortunately, there are still many dividend stocks with yields of 5% or more. And even better, investors do not have to sacrifice quality.

Multiple high-yield stocks have sustainable dividends with room for dividend growth in the future. The following five stocks have yields above 5%, with durable competitive advantages and long-term growth potential that provide safety to their dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

High-Yield Stocks: Philip Morris International (PM)

Philip Morris International is one of the world’s largest tobacco companies, with a market cap of $123 billion. PM sells its products outside the United States. The cigarette maker’s product portfolio includes its flagship Marlboro brand.
On July 21, Philip Morris reported second-quarter operating results. For the quarter, the company generated net revenue of $6.65 billion, which was down 14% as reported and down 9.5% excluding currency fluctuations. Shipment volume was down 14.5%, with cigarette shipment volume down 17.6% year-over-year.
The company has been hurt by a strong dollar, which has negatively affected the conversion of international sales into dollars. It has also dealt with the global economic downturn as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. To add to its struggles, it has to combat declining smoking rates across multiple countries.
In response, PM has invested heavily in its new product line called IQOS. This is a revolutionary product which heats tobacco instead of burning it. According to the company, this produces fewer harmful effects than traditional cigarettes. IQOS has seen early success through rapid adoption and high market share in multiple international markets such as Japan and Korea. Heated tobacco product sales increased 24% last quarter, and represent PM’s biggest future growth catalyst.
In the meantime, PM stock yields 6.1%. The company is likely to distribute virtually all of its earnings-per-share in dividends this year, but future earnings growth from new products and share repurchases should provide for modest dividend increases each year.

Enbridge (ENB)

Enbridge is an integrated oil and gas company based in Canada. It operates a variety of businesses including Liquids Pipelines, Gas Distributions, Energy Services, Gas Transmission & Midstream, and Green Power & Transmission. The company has a market capitalization of $60 billion.
ENB stock has declined 26% year-to-date, as the oil and gas producer has struggled under the weight of low oil and gas prices, as well as the coronavirus pandemic which has sent the global economy into recession. In Q2 2020, Enbridge saw its revenue decline approximately 40%. However, Enbridge’s adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the previous year’s quarter, as revenue declines were more than offset by lower costs.
Despite the coronavirus crisis, Enbridge maintained its guidance for distributable cash flow-per-share of $4.50 CAD-$4.80 CAD ($3.41-$3.63) for 2020. At the midpoint of guidance, Enbridge expects to increase DCF-per-share by approximately 2% in 2020. The company expects to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 70%, based on DCF-per-share guidance. This indicates the current dividend payout is secure.


					7 Value Stocks To Buy in an Overvalued Market				

Another important factor helping to secure Enbridge’s dividend is its quality balance sheet. With more than 40 diverse sources of cash flow and a BBB+ credit rating, Enbridge has a manageable level of debt. The company has $14 billion of available liquidity and its debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains within its target range of 4.5x to 5.0x.
Management has a target forecast of 5-7% average annual DCF growth through 2022. This growth will be achieved partly through rate increases, cost cuts, and new projects coming online. If the company reaches this forecast, it will have little trouble maintaining its dividend, and continuing to increase the dividend on a regular basis.
Enbridge has increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years. With a high dividend yield above 8%, Enbridge is an especially attractive stock for income investors.

Unum Group (UNM)

Unum Group is an insurance holding company providing a broad portfolio of financial protection benefits and services. The company operates through its Unum US, Unum UK, Unum Poland and Colonial Life businesses, providing disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision benefits to millions of customers. Unum generated revenue of approximately $12 billion in 2019.
Unum has been negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic to start 2020, but only to a mild effect. In the second quarter, Unum generated $3.0 billion in revenue, a 0.3% increase from the same quarter last year. The core Unum US segment reported a 9% decline in adjusted operating income. Premium income for the segment increased 1.2% while net investment income fell 3.9%. On an adjusted basis, earnings-per-share of $1.23 for the quarter declined 9.5% year-over-year.
Unum has developed a top position in its industry with a long track record of providing reliable service and establishing deep relationships with customers. These qualities have served the company well during recessions.
UNM stock performed surprisingly well in the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Unum posted earnings-per-share of $2.19, $2.51, $2.57 and $2.71 from 2007 through 2010, respectively. Furthermore, the dividend was increased during this time as well. Therefore, we expect Unum’s profits and dividend to hold up again in the current downturn. Unum has a 6.1% dividend yield, with a secure payout.

AbbVie (ABBV)

AbbVie is a pharmaceutical manufacturer spun off by Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in 2013. AbbVie’s most important product is Humira, which alone represents nearly half the company’s total revenue. This is a challenge, because Humira has already lost patent exclusivity in Europe, and will lose that status in the U.S. in 2023.
Fortunately, AbbVie has prepared for this by investing in new therapies, both organically and through acquisitions. Adjusted research and development expense totaled $5 billion in 2019, and the investment is already paying off.
AbbVie has received 14 major approvals since 2013, with 10 of those coming in the core categories of Immunology and Oncology. AbbVie has multiple growth opportunities to replace Humira. One example is Imbruvica, a treatment for the most common type of leukemia in adults, which generated 21% growth in the most recent quarter.
Growth from new products led to a strong performance in the second quarter. Revenue of $10.4 billion increased 26% year-over-year, while adjusted earnings-per-share increased 4% year-over-year to $2.34 for the quarter.


					7 Value Stocks To Buy in an Overvalued Market				

The $63 billion acquisition of Allergan will also boost AbbVie’s future growth. Allergan is a leader in aesthetics products such as Botox. The combined company will have annual revenues of nearly $50 billion.
ABBV stock qualifies as a Dividend Aristocrat, as its former parent company Abbott was on the list at the time of the spin-off. AbbVie has continued to increase its own dividends each year since. The stock now has a 5.5% yield, and with a projected payout ratio near 50% of adjusted EPS for 2020, the dividend is secure with room for continued increases.

International Business Machines (IBM)

It is rare to see tech stocks with high yields, but IBM is a unique stock within the tech sector. IBM is a global information technology company that provides integrated enterprise solutions for software, hardware and services. In the services business, IBM is the world’s largest IT provider with 5.5% market share. The company has five business segments: Cloud & Cognitive Software, Global Business Services, Global Technology Services, Systems, and Global Financing. IBM generated revenue of approximately $77 billion last year.
Earlier this month, the firm announced it will spin off its Global Technology Services division into its own publicly traded company. Its goal in doing so is to shift the focus at IBM on cloud services.
IBM reported better-than-expected results for Q2 2020. For the quarter, companywide revenue decreased 5.4% while diluted adjusted earnings per share declined 31%. However, revenue was significantly impacted by divestitures and currency fluctuations, which are generally non-recurring items. Excluding divestitures and currency, adjusted revenue declined a milder 1.9% for the quarter.
IBM continues to see declines in certain legacy segments, like consulting and application management services, but underneath the surface the company is making big strides in major growth areas such as the cloud. Total cloud revenue increased 34% on an adjusted basis for the quarter. Cloud revenue has increased 23% in the trailing four quarters. Lastly, Red Hat generated 18% revenue growth for the quarter.
These growth segments provide IBM with the ability to pay a generous dividend to shareholders. IBM stock currently yields 5.2%. The company has increased its dividend for 25 consecutive years, meaning it will join the list of Dividend Aristocrats in 2021.

2020-10-16,"A clinical trial conducted by the World Health Organization found that Gilead Sciences Inc.'s remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, AbbVie's  lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon did not impact mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The study was first reported by the Financial Times on Thursday. In a preprint, which is medical research that has not been peer-reviewed, researchers said that the four antiviral drugs had ""little or no effect"" on overall mortality, ventilation, and length of hospital stay among the 11,330 patients participating in the study. The Food and Drug Administration has authorized remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment, based on a clinical study conducted in the U.S. that found the drug could reduce recovery times. It had also granted an emergency use authorization to hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment although that EUA was rescinded this summer.

2020-10-20,"AbbVie (ABBV) has announced that it has submitted applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) seeking approval for Rinvoq (upadacitinib) for the treatment of adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.The atopic dermatitis indication applications to the FDA and EMA are supported by data from three pivotal Phase 3 studies.In all three studies, Rinvoq demonstrated significant improvement in skin clearance and reduction in itch in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis compared to placebo.Rinvoq met the co-primary endpoints including at least a 75% improvement in the Eczema Area Severity Index from baseline and a validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) at week 16. Additionally, more patients treated with either dose of upadacitinib experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch, defined as improvement in Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale.The safety profile of Rinvoq was consistent across the three pivotal Phase 3 studies in atopic dermatitis. No new safety risks were observed in these studies.“While there have been advancements in care, patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis continue to experience relentless itch and skin symptoms that can impact their everyday lives,” said Michael Severino, president of AbbVie. “These submissions are an important step forward in our commitment to providing an additional treatment option for those who struggle with this debilitating and often underappreciated disease.”Between 20% to 46% of adults with atopic dermatitis have moderate to severe disease. The range of symptoms pose significant physical, psychological and economic burden on individuals impacted by the disease.Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, Rinvoq is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. (See Abbvie’s stock analysis on TipRanks).Shares in ABBV are down 5% year-to-date, but the stock scores a bullish Strong Buy Street consensus. The $111 average analyst price target indicates 32% upside potential lies ahead.Citigroup analyst Andrew Baum recently raised the stock’s price target to $105 from $98 and reiterated a Buy rating. Baum believes that the “underappreciated revenue and/or durability” upside from the company’s marketed agents Skyrizi, Rinvoq and Imbruvica offsets the current risk from the recently announced congressional subpoena on AbbVie’s drug pricing practices.Related News:  Pfizer Targets FDA Approval For Covid-19 Vaccine In November; Shares Rise  Zogenix Rallies 7% On New Fintepla Data For Dravet Syndrome  Zynerba Up 6% As Zygel Shows Promise In Autism Trial More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Verizon Nabs Microsoft, Nokia For Private 5G Networks   * Zions Beats 3Q Profit; Street Says Hold   * Kamada To Supply Plasma-Based Covid-19 Therapy To Israel; Shares Surge 6%   * Agree Realty’s 3Q Sales Soar 33% On Property Acquisitions","AbbVie Submits US, EU Rinvoq Applications For Atopic Dermatitis"

Benzinga's report can help you figure out the ins and outs of the earnings release.What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding.Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts expect AbbVie's EPS to be near $2.76 on sales of $12.72 billion. AbbVie EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $2.33. Revenue was $8.48 billion.Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates.""

2020-11-03,"Americans went to the polls today under the shadow of a resurging pandemic, with a substantial increase in cases nationwide and the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 reaching record highs in a growing number of states. Meanwhile, it's still unclear what a second stimulus package from the federal government may look like and how long it will be until that arrives.To add fuel to this, there are several European governments that are starting to lock down their respective countries all over again in order to prevent the further spread of COVID.With all of this uncertainty, what is an investor to do? Adding dividend stocks as a potential defensive play can add protection to your portfolio.We’ve opened up the TipRanks database, finding three stocks whose profile justifies the entry risk in today’s conditions. All three offer at least 5% dividend yield, and backed by several analysts, enough to earn a “strong buy” consensus rating. Let's take a closer loo. AbbVie (ABBV)AbbVie is a pharmaceutical company, one of Big Pharma’s major names. Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are known for their combination of high risk and high reward potential. The rewards and risks are both typified in Humira, the company’s successful immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory drug. Humira is expected to bring in ~40% of AbbVie’s 2020 drug division revenues – but with an expired patent, competition is growing. Against this backdrop, AbbVie had acquired another pharmaceutical company, Allergan, that increased top-line revenues by $16B for AbbVie while the combined companies bring in $2B in synergies. The acquisition showed investors that AbbVie is simultaneously looking beyond their holdings in Humira.Future guidance has revenues moving higher along with earnings. Guidance on revenues has been increased to $10.47 - $10.49 EPS versus $10.35 - $10.45 EPS. The earnings were enough to allow management to raise the dividend from $1.18 to $1.30. At $5.20 annualized, this dividend yields 6.11%, more than 2.5x the average dividend found among S&P listed companies. The payout ratio of 49.7% indicates that the dividend is safe – current earnings easily cover it, and there is plenty of room for further growth.Covering the stock for SVB Leerink, analyst Geoff Porges noted, ""AbbVie had another strong beat and raise in Q3, demonstrating their very resilient business during the pandemic and highlighting strong growth prospects for their core business. Guidance was once again raised, and the company’s comments about mid- to long-term revenue potential for their core products were very positive [...] AbbVie’s valuation seems very attractive at today’s price, and we see substantial upside potential as we expect the stock to revert to its more normalized absolute and relative multiple after the current election blues are resolved in the new year.""To this end, Porges rates AbbVie an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $119 price target. This figure suggests a potential upside of 35% over the next year. (To watch Porges track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street is very bullish on Abbvie. There are a total of 8 ratings; 7 Buys and 1 Hold -- all add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s current price is $88 and the average price target is $110.13 suggesting 25% one-year upside move. (See ABBV stock analysis on TipRanks)WesBanco (WSBC)Next up is WesBanco, a bank operating in the region of western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky with 236 branches. The pandemic has struck financial institutions because of loans in default. Loan losses, or their potential, have forced banks and lenders to start building up reserve ratios and set aside revenue for loan losses.WesBanco has spent the past two quarters building up their reserve ratio with a large amount being set aside in Q2 and a smaller amount in Q3 and currently has an above-peer ratio level.Turning to the dividend, WSBC currently pays out 32 cents per common share, and even in the coronavirus crisis it held that payment steady. The 52-cent payment annualizes to $1.32 per share, and gives a considerable yield of 5.16%.Raymond James analyst William Wallace is standing squarely with the bulls, noting: ""PTPP earnings came in above expectations as noted, driven largely by lower operating expenses and higher fee income. Ultimately, we expect investors to remain honed in on credit in the nearer-term, where the company's bolstered reserve continues to provide us with a certain degree of comfort. All in, with shares trading essentially in line with peers, we continue to view the risk/reward dynamic positively given the company's solid capital levels (+9% TCE), along with both promising core earnings and deferral trends.""Unsurprisingly, Wallace rates WesBanco an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $29 price target. This target suggests a potential upside of 15% over the next year. (To watch Wallace’s track record, click here)Wallace is not the only fan of WSBC on Wall Street, as TipRanks analytics exhibit the stock as a Strong Buy. Based on 4 analysts tracked in the last 3 months, 3 rate the stock a Buy, while one says Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $26.88, marking a 6.5% upside from where the stock is currently trading. (See WSBC stock analysis on TipRanks)CatchMark Timber (CTT)CatchMark Timber is an owner and operator of timberlands located in various parts of the country. The pandemic has not directly affected the timber industry. However, timber itself has maintained higher prices as home builders in the United States have seen increased demand. A lot of this new demand is generated from individuals moving out of cities into suburban areas.In the most recent quarter, Q3 2020 EBITDA for CatchMark Timber was above expectations coming in at $12.4MM versus $11MM consensus. The above-expectation earnings were attributed to cost controls from logging and hauling as well as SG&A costs. At the same time that CatchMark reported Q1 earnings, it also declared the Q3 dividend. The payment remains steady at 13.5 cents per share, yielding a solid 6%. The company has a 6-year history of keeping up its dividend payments, in all economic conditions.Adding to the good news, RBC Capital analyst Paul Quinn, rated 5-stars with TipRanks, has upgraded CTT to Outperform (i.e. Buy), while keeping his price target at $10. (To watch analyst track record, click here)As Quinn states, “CatchMark reported Q3 results that were in line with our forecasts but above consensus expectations. Although there have been minimal changes in business prospects over the last few months, CatchMark shares have moved in a wide range around our target price of $10.

2020-11-17,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Warren Buffett is a living, breathing billionaire, but he’s also a leading economic indicator. So after his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. dumped almost $13 billion of stocks in the throes of the Covid-19 crisis, investors were beside themselves. They’ll now be quite relieved to see that his company is back in buying mode, making the biggest outlay for equity purchases in a year.And he’s not just making oddball bets, like Japanese trading houses and, yikes, gold. A filing late Monday showed that in the latest period Berkshire Hathaway bought a handful of U.S. pharmaceutical giants: AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. It also purchased a new stake in T-Mobile US Inc., the wireless carrier with the most enviable spectrum position heading into 5G, and Snowflake Inc., one of the hottest tech IPOs of the year. They’re part of the net $4.8 billion Berkshire spent buying equities during the period; it spent an additional $9 billion buying up its own shares.  The disclosure of Berkshire’s Pfizer holding — valued at $138 million as of Monday’s close — comes a week after the drugmaker announced that its Covid-19 vaccine has been more than 90% effective in preventing cases of the virus. Following up on the good news, Moderna Inc., another company in the Covid-19 vaccine race, said Monday that its formulation was 94.5% effective. Even so, my colleague Max Nisen tells me that Buffett’s pharma bets likely aren’t entirely vaccine-related, as that logic only really works for Pfizer. Instead, Buffett — or one of his investing deputies — probably sees broader value in the pharma space, which had been somewhat beaten down heading into the U.S. election on fears of a “blue wave” that would produce profit-crimping policies. Those fears aren’t quite so intense without Democrats taking control of the Senate, or at least not yet.Berkshire continued its banking purge — further reducing its stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. It also exited a $1.3 billion position in Costco Wholesale Corp., which I guess means Buffett didn’t take my suggestion to outright acquire the retailer for his next “elephant-sized” deal. But shares of Costco have risen 7% to an all-time high since the third quarter ended, and it just declared a whopping $10-a-share special dividend. Buffett is going to be hitting the See’s candies hard tonight!Read more: Buffett's Next Bulk Purchase Should Be Costco: Tara LachapelleBut it sure is good to see the investor, well, investing again. Right before the pandemic hit, Buffett said in a TV interview that he’s been a net buyer of stocks every year since he was 11 years old; he’s 90 now. It's incredible how a virus — and the mishandling thereof — rattled his optimism in a way that wars, terrorist attacks and other recessions didn’t. The U.S. isn’t out of the woods yet, but there are reasons to be hopeful, and that seems to be what Buffett’s latest moves are suggesting. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

2020-11-17,"Shares of AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) increased by 5.96% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt AbbVie has.AbbVie's Debt Based on AbbVie's balance sheet as of November 4, 2020, long-term debt is at $82.28 billion and current debt is at $4.78 billion, amounting to $87.06 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $7.89 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $79.17 billion.Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. AbbVie has $149.62 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.58. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another.Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2020-11-17,"Looking at Q3, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) earned $3.25 billion, a 332.85% increase from the preceding quarter. AbbVie also posted a total of $12.90 billion in sales, a 23.76% increase since Q2. AbbVie earned $752.00 million, and sales totaled $10.43 billion in Q2.What Is ROCE? Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in AbbVie's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, AbbVie posted an ROCE of 0.21%.It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future.View more earnings on ABBVReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For AbbVie, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Recap AbbVie reported Q3 earnings per share at $2.83/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.76/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * What Does AbbVie's Debt Look Like?  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For November 10, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-25,"By Bob Ciura with Sure Dividend.The U.S. stock market has come roaring back from the lows seen in March and April, but the broader economy remains on unstable footing. The potential for a double-dip recession could bring about another downturn in the stock market. For risk-averse investors, it may make sense to buy high-quality dividend stocks in this climate of uncertainty.For this reason, we recommend income investors looking for stability, consider the Dividend Aristocrats. This is an exclusive list of 65 stocks in the S&P 500 Index, that have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Such a long track record of annual dividend increases proves a company's ability to withstand recessions.The following three stocks are all on the list of Dividend Aristocrats. In addition, they have high dividend yields well above the S&P 500 average, as well as reasonable valuations that could provide investors with high total returns in the years ahead.Undervalued Dividend Aristocrat 1: AbbVieAbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) is a healthcare giant with a focus on pharmaceuticals. Its most important individual product is Humira, a multi-purpose pharmaceutical that was the top-selling drug in the world last year. AbbVie was spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT), its former parent company which is also a Dividend Aristocrat. AbbVie has performed very well over the course of 2020.In the third quarter, AbbVie's revenue of $12.9 billion increased 52% year-over-year. Revenue was boosted by the Allergan acquisition, as well as growth from new products. AbbVie earned $2.83 per share during the third quarter, up 21% from the previous year's quarter. The company also raised full-year guidance and now expects 2020 adjusted earnings-per-share in a range of $10.47 to $10.49, which would make for another year of growth.AbbVie also raised its dividend by 10% in late October. The stock has a high dividend yield of 5.3%, making it an attractive mix of yield and growth. AbbVie stock also appears to be undervalued, trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.4, using the midpoint of full-year adjusted EPS guidance. This is a fairly low multiple for a highly profitable and growing business.AbbVie's low valuation is likely due to uncertainty regarding its flagship product Humira, which is now facing biosimilar competition in Europe and will lose patent protection in the U.S. in 2023. But AbbVie has long prepared for this by investing in its own new products, and by the Allergan acquisition. For example, AbbVie has seen strong growth from Imbruvica, which saw a 9% increase in sales last quarter.  AbbVie also completed the $63 billion acquisition of Allergan which makes a broad line of popular aesthetics products such as Botox.Our fair value estimate for AbbVie stock is a P/E of 10.5, compared with a forward P/E of 8.4. This means that if AbbVie's valuation expanded from 8.4 to 10.5 over the next five years, total returns (including EPS growth and dividends) could exceed 10% per year.Undervalued Dividend Aristocrat 2: Walgreens Boots AllianceWalgreens Boots Alliance (NYSE: WBA) is a major pharmacy retailer with nearly 19,000 stores in 11 countries. Walgreens Boots Alliance generates nearly $140 billion in annual revenue. Walgreens has been under pressure on many fronts, not just the coronavirus pandemic but also from a longer-running downturn for physical retail.Internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and many others have gradually taken market share from physical stores, as consumers have gravitated toward online shopping for the convenience. This trend was already taking place heading into 2020, and the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online shopping. Still, Walgreens remains highly profitable and continues to grow sales.On October 15th, 2020 Walgreens reported Q4 and full-year 2020 results for the period ending August 31st, 2020. For the quarter, sales increased 2.3% to $34.7 billion. On a per-share basis, adjusted EPS decreased -28.2% to $1.02, reflecting an estimated adverse impact of -$0.46 from the COVID-19 pandemic.For the fiscal year, sales increased 2.0% to $139.5 billion. Adjusted earnings-per-share totaled $4.74, down 21% year-over-year but ahead of previous guidance of $4.65 to $4.70. This included an estimated -$1.06 adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company anticipates a recovery in the upcoming year, with fiscal 2021 guidance that calls for low single-digit growth in adjusted EPS.Continuing to grow sales and earnings, albeit at a modest rate, would still allow Walgreens to increase its dividend each year, as it has done for 45 consecutive years. Shares yield 4.5% currently, and the stock appears to be undervalued. With a forward P/E ratio of 7.9 compared with our fair value estimate of 10, we believe Walgreens stock can provide total returns of 13%-14% per year over the next five years.Undervalued Dividend Aristocrat 3: AT&TAT&T Inc (NYSE: T) is a telecommunications giant with a large offering of services including wireless, broadband, and pay TV. AT&T also operates the satellite television business DirecTV. The company has invested heavily to restore growth in recent years, including the massive ~$85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which owns multiple valuable media properties including HBO, CNN, and the Warner Bros. production company.These efforts have been slow to materialize, as the coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted AT&T to start 2020. Still, AT&T generates a high level of cash flow, which allows it to pay down debt and pay dividends to shareholders. In the 2020 third quarter, AT&T generated revenue of $42.3 billion, along with operating cash flow of $12.1 billion. The company recorded more than 5 million total domestic wireless net adds along with over 1 million postpaid net additions. AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner should pay off in the long run, as it provides AT&T with valuable diversification. Going forward, AT&T will be an owner of content in addition to a distributor, which is increasingly important in the era of streaming and cord-cutting. Another promising growth catalyst is 5G rollout. AT&T now provides access to 5G to parts of over 350 U.S. markets.AT&T still expects free cash flow of at least $26 billion for the full year. AT&T's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was ~2.66x at the end of the quarter, indicating a manageable level of debt. This is crucial for AT&T's ability to pay its dividend, which is presumably the biggest reason to own the stock. AT&T currently yields 7.3%, an extremely high yield considering the S&P 500 average yield is under 2%. In an environment of low interest rates, AT&T is a highly appealing stock for value investors. Plus, AT&T has increased its dividend for over 30 years in a row.The stock is also significantly undervalued in our view, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 8.9 compared with our fair value estimate of 11. This means valuation expansion could boost future shareholder returns by approximately 4.6% per year over the next five years. Including the 7.3% dividend yield and 3% expected annual earnings-per-share growth, expected returns could reach nearly 15% over the next five years.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Analysts React To Gap's Earnings Miss, 20% Fall: Near-Term Visibility Diminished  * 50 Stocks Moving In Wednesday's Mid-Day Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2021-01-13,"SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Jan. 13, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: HARP), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T cell engagers, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation for HPN217 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. HPN217, a tri-specific T cell activating recombinant protein construct (TriTAC®) targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a well-validated antigen expressed on malignant multiple myeloma cells. Harpoon has four drug product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies based on its proprietary TriTAC platform.  “Orphan Drug Designation for multiple myeloma represents a significant milestone in the development of HPN217 and recognizes its potential to address a significant unmet medical need for the patients suffering from this condition,” said Jerry McMahon, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive of Harpoon Therapeutics. “I am pleased with the clinical progress we are making with this program and we are planning to present interim data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial later this year.”The FDA's Orphan Drug Designation program provides orphan status to drugs defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan Drug Designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for certain development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, prescription drug user fee exemptions and seven-year marketing exclusivity upon FDA approval.About the Phase 1/2 Trial for HPN217In April 2020, Harpoon announced dosing of the first patient with HPN217 (BCMA TriTAC) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial focused on relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). HPN217 is covered by a global development and option agreement with AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV). Dose escalation for HPN217 in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial is progressing rapidly. HPN217 has been well tolerated, and no DLTs had been observed as of the most recent December 1, 2020 data cutoff date. A presentation of interim data is anticipated in 2021, with initiation of a dose expansion cohort in the second half of 2021.For additional information about the trial, please visit clinicaltrials.gov using the identifier NCT04184050.About Harpoon TherapeuticsHarpoon Therapeutics is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T cell engagers that harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases. T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient’s own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells. Using its proprietary Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct (TriTAC®) platform, Harpoon is developing a pipeline of novel TriTACs initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. HPN424 targets PSMA and is in a Phase 1/2a trial for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. HPN536 targets mesothelin and is in a Phase 1/2a trial for cancers expressing mesothelin, initially focused on ovarian and pancreatic cancers. HPN217 targets BCMA and is in a Phase 1/2 trial for relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma. HPN328 targets DLL3 and is in a Phase 1/2 trial for small cell lung cancer and other DLL3-associated tumors. Harpoon has also developed a proprietary ProTriTAC™ platform, which applies a prodrug concept to its TriTAC platform to create a therapeutic T cell engager that remains inactive until it reaches the tumor.

2021-01-22,"Most long-term investors love passive income stocks. Therefore, today we introduce seven “Dividend Aristocrats,” or businesses that have increased the base dividend every year for the past 25 years. According to metrics from S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), “Since 1926, dividends have contributed to approximately one-third of total return while capital appreciations have contributed two-thirds. Therefore, both sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are important to total return expectations.” Over the past year, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index has returned over 6%. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has increased by 5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Solid businesses with wide moats tend to be able to generate stable revenues and strong cash flows in most years, even in volatile times or recessions. In fact, many such firms end up gaining market share at the expense of weaker businesses that might simply fight to stay alive during economically tough times. Meanwhile, companies that consistently grow dividends are in effect saying that they are committed to sharing the success of the business with stockholders. With that information, here are seven Dividend Aristocrats that deserve your attention in 2021: 7 Airline Stocks Being Fueled by Vaccine News AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) Chubb (NYSE:CB) Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (BACS:NOBL) Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Dividend Aristocrats: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $62.55 – $113.41 1-year price change: Up 23.82% Dividend yield: 4.71% Illinois-based biopharma group AbbVie is our first Dividend Aristocrat. It has numerous research and development (R&D) centers and manufacturing facilities globally. Several of its therapeutic areas include eye care, gastroenterology, immunology, neuroscience, oncology, rheumatology, virology, and women’s health. In addition, its Allergan Aesthetics portfolio includes products, such as Botox Cosmetics, fillers, and implants. The last quarterly report showed non-GAAP adjusted net revenues of $12.882 billion, an increase of 4.1% year-over-year (YoY). Net earnings of $2.31 billion meant an increase of 22.5% YoY. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.83, up 21% YoY. Cash and equivalents stood at $7.89 billion. CEO Richard A. Gonzalez cited, “Results from key growth products – including Skyrizi, Rinvoq and Ubrelvy – continue to track ahead of our expectations, our aesthetics portfolio is demonstrating a strong V-shaped recovery, our hematologic-oncology franchise is delivering double-digit growth and we’re advancing numerous attractive late-stage pipeline programs.” The company has in-demand therapies and products that contribute to revenue growth. AbbVie’s pipeline also deserves attention. I’d regard any drop in price as an opportunity to buy the shares. Albemarle (ALB) Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $48.89 – $187.25 1-year price change: Up 124.84% Dividend yield: 0.89% Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle produces specialty chemicals used in a wide range of products manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, agricultural companies, water treatment companies, electronics products manufacturers, refineries, and others. In 2020, Albemarle caught investors’ attention as it is the industry leader in lithium, used to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Consumers’ love for EVs translated to a jump in the ALB share price. Investors believe the new administration in Washington will continue to provide tailwinds for the renewable energy sector. Q3 results announced in early November showed net sales of $747 million, down by 15% YoY. Net income was $98.3 million and decreased 36.6%. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.09 showed a decline of 28.8% YoY. CEO Kent Masters said, “We now expect to realize approximately $80 million of cost savings this year and to reach an annual savings rate of $120 million or more by the end of 2021. We expect these savings to represent a first wave of ongoing operational improvements that will reap notable benefits for the company.” 8 Indian Stocks That Belong on Your International Radar ALB stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 48.39x and 6x, respectively. As a result of the recent run-up in price, the valuation metrics are overstretched. Potential investors could consider investing around $170. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $103.11 – $182.32 1-year price change: Down 7.87% Dividend yield: 2.31% Roseland, New Jersey-based Automatic Data Processing provides cloud-based human capital management (HCM) solutions such as human resources (HR) payroll, tax, and benefits administration, as well as business outsourcing services. The company tends to generate steady, recurring revenue. However, 2020 has also meant challenges due to job losses stateside, which has meant revenue loss for the group. According to the most recent quarterly metrics, revenues came at $3.5 billion, down by 1% YoY. Adjusted net earnings of $605 million showed an increase of 4%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.41 and increased by 5%. CFO Kathleen Winters commented, “Our first quarter results significantly exceeded our expectations across the board… While we still expect to face headwinds over the course of the year, we will continue to look for ways to drive strong performance in both the near and long-term.” Forward P/E and P/S ratios are 27.9x and 4.81x, respectively. Despite the recent decline in price, I believe the shares are still richly valued for the current environment. A potential decline would improve the margin of safety. Emerson Electric (EMR) Source: Shutterstock 52-week range: $37.75 – $84.44 1-year price change: Up 6.29% Dividend yield: 2.44% St Louis, Missouri-based Emerson Electric is a technology and engineering company. The group focuses on Automation Solutions (manufacturing electrical components and providing services and training) and Commercial & Residential Solutions (covering heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration). FY20 Q4 metrics released in early November showed GAAP net sales of $4.6 billion, down 8% YoY. Net earnings were $723 million, up 1% YoY. Adjusted EPS came at $1.10, down 4%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.02 billion and increased 2%. CEO David N. Farr commented, “Amidst all the challenges, we exceeded our second quarter reset financial forecast in sales, EBITDA, and cash flow… We also continued to invest and took bold action to build on our innovation and technology footprint of the future, with three strategic acquisitions: American Governor, Open Systems International Inc. and Progea.” 9 Beginner Stocks for First-Time Investors EMR stock’s forward P/E and P/S ratios are 25.5x and 2.99x, respectively. Emerson Electric’s automation division currently has significant exposure to the traditional energy (i.e., oil and gas) industry. However, it is also growing its alternative energy (i.e., clean fuels and renewables) businesses. Any decline below $80, especially toward $75, would offer a good entry point into the engineering group. Chubb (CB) Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.com 52-week range: $87.35 – $167.74 1-year price change: Up 1.66% Dividend yield: 2% Chubb is one of the largest publicly traded property and casualty insurance companies worldwide. 2020 has meant challenges for the industry. The pandemic, hurricanes, flooding, flooding, and civil unrest have meant increased insurance claims. However, the company’s operations stood the test of times. The most recent quarterly earnings showed revenue of $9.46 billion, up 4.6% YoY. Net income was $1.19 billion, an increase of 9.4%. Diluted EPS was $2.63, up by 10.5%. Operating cash flow was $3.5 billion. CEO Evan G. Greenberg cited, “With strong and continuously improving underwriting conditions in most all regions of the world, we grew P&C (property and casualty) net premiums written 6.5% in the quarter in constant dollars, comprised of 10.8% growth in our commercial P&C business and a 3.3% decline in consumer lines … we expect to grow our EPS through both revenue growth and improved margins.” The fact that Chubb was able to grow its premiums written in 2020 makes it stand out among insurers. I believe the shares could find a place in most long-term portfolios.

As far as sector allocations are concerned, Industrials leads the ETF with 24.03%, followed by Consumer Staples (18.78%), and Materials (13.19%).

It has about 57,000 employees in over 300 distribution facilities worldwide. The customer count exceeds 620,000. Needless to say, 2002 was a difficult year as many of those customers had to scale down operations due to the pandemic. Sysco released FY21 Q1 metrics in early November. Sales were $11.8 billion, a decrease of 23.0% YoY. Non-GAAP net earnings were $173.5 million, down by 66.0%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was 34 cents, a decline of 65.3% CEO Kevin Hourican said, “Although our first quarter 2021 results continue to be impacted by the pandemic, we are pleased with our overall expense management and our ability to produce positive free cash flow and a profitable quarter despite a 23% reduction in sales.” A potential decline toward $70 would offer better long-term value. In the coming quarters, as economies recover and cities and countries go back to normal, Sysco’s operations are likely to recover as well.

2021-01-25,"AL002 is the first product candidate targeting TREM2 in Phase 2 clinical developmentStudy will enroll early Alzheimer’s disease patients at up to 90 sites globallyAlzheimer’s disease is a devastating neurological disease affecting nearly six million people in the U.S. and 35 million globally SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Jan. 25, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alector, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALEC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, today announced that the first participant has been dosed in INVOKE-2, a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AL002 in slowing disease progression in individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease. AL002 is an investigational, humanized monoclonal antibody that targets triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a transmembrane receptor protein that is expressed on a subset of innate immune cells and selectively on microglia, which serve as the immune cells in the brain. The AL002 clinical program is being developed in collaboration with AbbVie. The role of TREM2 in Alzheimer’s disease was first discovered through large scale genome-wide association studies where it has been shown to have one of the most important genetic links to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. Research suggests that reduction of TREM2 functionality may lead to Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Increasing TREM2 activity in the brain may prove to be an effective therapeutic approach by activating the brain’s immune system to target multiple pathologies that are present in Alzheimer’s disease, rather than focusing on a single pathology. “Loss of TREM2 activity has been shown through human genetics to be one of the notable risk factors for developing Alzheimer’s disease,” said Robert Paul, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer of Alector. “AL002 is a first-in-class TREM2 targeting antibody in Phase 2 clinical development for Alzheimer’s disease. By targeting this receptor, we believe it may be possible to slow the progression of this disease. Our ability to move quickly into a Phase 2 study is based on compelling preclinical and Phase 1 data showing that AL002 engages TREM2 on microglia cells in the brain, resulting in increased microglial activity. We look forward to efficiently enrolling the Phase 2 study to better understand the potential clinical benefits of AL002.” “Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease that robs a person of their identity, and a family of their loved one. We are hopeful that AL002 may one day be a treatment option for the millions of people diagnosed with this disease,” said Michael Gold, M.D., vice president, Development Neurosciences, AbbVie. “We are pleased that the study was initiated rapidly and look forward to data from the Phase 2 study that will inform a potential pivotal clinical development program for AL002.” INVOKE-2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center Phase 2 study that will enroll approximately 265 participants with early Alzheimer’s disease at up to 90 sites globally. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 study is to measure disease progression utilizing the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum Boxes (CDR-SB). The CDR-SB is a validated instrument that assess both cognitive and functional domains and is used to assess (score) the severity of Alzheimer’s disease. The study will also employ multiple fluid and imaging biomarkers, and will assess several secondary clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints, as well as the safety of treatment with AL002. To learn more about the Phase 2 study, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/. About AL002AL002 is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody that targets triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) with the most important genetic links to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. TREM2 is a transmembrane receptor expressed on a subset of innate immune cells and selectively on microglia, which constitute the brain’s immune system. Reduction of TREM2 functionality may lead to Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. AL002 counteracts this decreased functionality by optimizing TREM2 signaling to improve cell survival and proliferation, and activity of microglia. Collaboration with AbbVieIn October 2017, Alector entered into a global strategic collaboration with AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), to co-develop and commercialize therapeutics to treat Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Alector granted AbbVie an exclusive option to global development and commercialization for two programs, including TREM2.

It is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability of patients to care for themselves. In most people with Alzheimer’s disease, symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that as of 2020, there are 5.8 million Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer’s disease, and projects that number will rise to nearly 14 million by 2050.About AlectorAlector is a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The Company is developing a broad portfolio of innate immune system programs, designed to functionally repair genetic mutations that cause dysfunction of the brain’s immune system and enable the rejuvenated immune cells to counteract emerging brain pathologies. Immuno-neurology targets immune dysfunction as a root cause of multiple pathologies that are drivers of degenerative brain disorders. The Company’s immuno-neurology product candidates are supported by biomarkers and target genetically defined patient populations in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. This scientific approach is also the basis for the Company’s immuno-oncology programs. Alector is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.

2021-02-02,"On Wednesday, February 03, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) will release its latest earnings report. Here is Benzinga's outlook for the company. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see AbbVie reporting earnings of $2.85 per share on revenue of $13.70 billion. AbbVie earnings in the same period a year ago was $2.21 per share. Quarterly sales came in at $8.70 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the ""consensus estimates."" A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an ""earnings surprise"" and may move the stock by a considerable margin. View more earnings on ABBV If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Wednesday, EPS would be up 28.96%. Revenue would be up 57.4% from the same quarter last year.

AbbVie’s (ABBV) CEO Richard A. Gonzalez said, “We successfully completed the transformative Allergan acquisition and delivered another year of strong results in 2020, despite the challenges presented by the global pandemic. Based on our broad portfolio of diversified growth assets and the robust momentum of our business, we expect impressive growth again in 2021.” Revenues of the company’s immunology business portfolio increased by 15.3% year-on-year to $5.9 billion in 4Q while sales at its hematologic oncology business portfolio grew by 15.7% to $1.8 billion. (See AbbVie stock analysis on TipRanks) The company provided FY21 diluted EPS guidance in the range of $6.69 to $6.89 and expects its adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $12.32 to $12.52. Following the fourth quarter results, Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Buy rating and a price target of $117 on the stock. Divan wrote in a note to investors, “The beat was led by several important products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Ubrelvy, Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm, and supported by other assets such as Linzess and Restasis.” “Following their recent disclosure of long-term guidance through 2030, we believe AbbVie now represents an especially compelling investment opportunity, with robust near-term growth and good visibility into its long-term growth prospects, while still trading at a significant discount to its peers and offering a robust dividend.” the analyst added. The rest of the Street has a bullish outlook on the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. That’s based on 10 analysts recommending a Buy versus just 1 analyst suggesting a Hold. The average analyst price target of $120.18 implies about 15% upside potential to current levels.

2021-02-03,"AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved up to $103.37 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-02-19 Strike Price: $110.00 Volume: 1143 Open Interest: 10804 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-02-21,"When billionaire financier Ray Dalio makes a move, Wall Street pays attention. Dalio, who got his start working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange trading commodity futures, founded the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, in 1975. With the firm managing about $140 billion in global investments and Dalio’s own net worth coming at $17 billion, he has earned legendary status on Wall Street. Summing up his success, Dalio has three pieces of advice for investors. First, diversify. Keeping a wide range of stocks in the portfolio, from multiple sectors, is the surest way to invest well. Second, don’t think that rising markets will rise forever. This is Dalio’s variation on an old saw that past performance does not guarantee future returns. Dalio will tell you that all strong past returns really guarantee are current high prices. And finally, Dalio tells investors, “Do the opposite of what your instincts are.” Or put another way, don’t follow the herd, as such thinking frequently leads to suboptimal results. Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration, we used TipRanks’ database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform, the analyst community believes they do, with all of the picks earning “Strong Buy” consensus ratings. Linde PLC (LIN) The first new position is in Linde, the world’s largest industrial gas production company, whether counting by revenues or market share. Linde produces a range of gasses for industrial use, and is the dominant supplier of argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, along with niche gasses like carbon dioxide for the soft drink industry. The company also produces gas storage and transfer equipment, welding equipment, and refrigerants. In short, Linde embodies Dalio’s ‘diversify’ dictum. Linde’s industry leadership and essential products helped the company bounce back from the corona crisis. The company’s revenues slipped in 1H20, but grew in the second half, reaching pre-corona levels in Q3 and exceeding those levels in Q4. In a sign of confidence, the company held its dividend steady through the ‘corona year,’ at 96 cents per common share – and in its recent Q1 declaration, Linde raised the payment to $1.06 per share. This annualizes to $4.24 and gives a yield of 1.7%. The key point here is not the modest yield, but the company’s confidence in the security of its positions, allowing it to keep a steady dividend at a time when many peers are cutting profit sharing. It’s no wonder, then, that an investor like Dalio would take an interest in a company like Linde. The billionaire’s fund snapped up 20,149 shares during the fourth quarter, worth $5.05 million at current prices. Assessing Linde for BMO, analyst John McNulty expresses his confidence in Linde’s current performance. ""LIN continues to execute on its growth strategy to drive solid double-digit earnings growth, notably without requiring a further macro improvement. In our view, management's 11-13% guide for 2021 remains conservative driven by its on coming projects, continued pricing, efficiency gains, and solid buybacks with its strong balance sheet and cash flows. Further, the solid FCF position provides them plenty of dry powder for M&A, de-caps, etc. We believe LIN is poised to continue to surprise investors and outperform the broader group even in a cyclical market. the largest global industrial gas company,"" McNulty opined. In line with his bullish comments, McNulty rates LIN as a Buy, and his $320 price target implies an upside of ~28% for the coming year. (To watch McNulty's track record, click here) Wall Street’s analysts are in broad agreement on the quality of Linde’s stock, as shown by the 15 Buy reviews overbalancing the 3 Holds. This gives the stock its Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. Shares are priced at $250.88, and their $295.73 average price target suggests they have ~18% growth ahead. (See LIN stock analysis on TipRanks) BlackRock (BLK) Next up is the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock has over $8.67 trillion in assets under management. The company is one of the dominant index funds in the US financial scene, and saw $16.2 billion revenue last year, with a net income of $4.9 billion. BlackRock’s recent Q4 report shows its strength, as far as numbers can. EPS came in at $10.02 per share, a 12% sequential gain and a 20% year-over-year gain. Quarterly revenues of $4.8 billion were up 17% yoy. The full-year top line was up 11% from 2019. BlackRock achieved all of this even as the corona crisis flattened the economy in 1H20. In the first quarter of this year, BlackRock declared its regular quarterly dividend, and raised the payment by 13% to $4.13 per common share. At an annualized payment of $16.52, this gives a yield of 2.3%. The company has kept the dividend reliable for the past 12 years. Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity, Dalio's fund pulled the trigger on 19,917 shares, giving it a new position in BLK. The value of this new addition? More than $14 million. Covering BLK for Deutsche Bank, analyst Brian Bedell writes, “We view 4Q results as very good with strong long-term net inflows across its products which we expect to continue despite a one-time, $55bn pension fund outflow of low-fee equity index assets expected in 1H21 which mgmt. said would have a minimal impact on base fee revenue. Additionally, total net inflows drove annualized organic base management fee growth of 13%, a quarterly record, on annualized long-term organic AuM growth of 7%. We expect organic base fee growth to exceed organic AuM growth coming into 2021 driven by a flow mix skewed toward higher fee-rate products for now.” To this end, Bedell rates BLK a Buy and his $837 price target suggests the stock has ~18% upside ahead of it. (To watch Bedell’s track record, click here) The analyst consensus tells a very similar story. BLK has received 6 Buy ratings in the last three months, against a single Hold – a clear sign that analysts are impressed with the company’s potential. Shares sell for $710.11, and the average price target of $832.17 gives the stock a 17% upside potential. (See BLK stock analysis on TipRanks) AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV) AbbVie is a major name in the pharma industry. The company is the maker of Humira, an anti-inflammatory used in the treatment of a wide range of chronic illnesses including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and psoriasis. The company’s other immunology drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, were approved by the FDA in 2019 as treatments for psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, and saw combined sales of $2.3 billion last year. AbbVie expects that these drugs will ‘fill the gap’ in profits when the Humira patents expire in 2023, with up to $15 billion in sales by 2025. Humira is currently the main driver of AbbVie’s immunology portfolio, and provides $19.8 billion of the portfolio’s $22.2 billion in annual revenues, and a significant part of the company’s total sales. For the full year 2020, across all divisions, AbbVie saw $45.8 billion in revenues, with an adjusted diluted EPS of $10.56. In addition to its high-profile anti-inflammatory line, AbbVie also has a ‘stable’ of long-established drugs on the market. As an example, the company owns Depakote, a common anti-seizure medication. AbbVie also maintains an active research pipeline, with scores of drug candidates undergoing studies in the disciplines of immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and virology. For investors, AbbVie has a long-standing commitment to returning profits to shareholders. The company has an 8-year history of keeping a reliable – and growing – dividend. In the most recent declaration, made this month for a payment to go out in May, AbbVie raised the dividend 10% to $1.30 per common share. At $5.20 annualized, this gives a yield of 4.9%. Once again, we are looking at stock that embodies some of Dalio’s advice. Pulling the trigger on ABBV in the fourth quarter, Dalio’s firm purchased 25,294 shares. At current valuation, this is worth $2.66 million. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges covers ABBV, and is impressed with the way that the company is preparing in advance for the loss of US exclusivity on its best-selling product. “Between ABBV’s ex-Humira portfolio’s growth trajectory and a broad portfolio of catalysts across early-, mid-, and late-stage assets, it is hard to find a biopharma company that is better positioned, even with their looming LOE. ABBV is prepared for 2023, and has growth drivers to drive better than industry average top- and bottom-line growth in the period before (2021-2022) and after (2024-2028) 2023,” Porges opined. Porges gives ABBV an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and sets a $140 price target that indicates room for a 33% one-year upside. (To watch Porges’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 10 reviews on ABBV shares, and 9 of those are to Buy – a margin that makes the analyst consensus rating a Strong Buy. The stock is trading for $105.01 and has an average price target of $122.60. This suggests an upside of ~17% over the next 12 months.

2021-03-17,"(Bloomberg) -- The Food and Drug Administration’s extension of a review for AbbVie Inc.’s already-approved Rinvoq dealt another blow to biotech investors who are grappling with a recent wave of surprising moves from the regulator.Regulatory setbacks for drug applications from Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc., Athenex Inc., and FibroGen Inc. have caught Wall Street flat-footed in the past month alone, as analysts debate whether the FDA is getting more conservative over approvals. The uncertainty has started to show with gains for biotech stocks coming in at about half the returns for the broader market this year.Investor pessimism was apparent in Wednesday’s trading as the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, a closely-tracked barometer of the industry, slumped as much as 1.6%, a deeper drop than the broader market. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI), which is more exposed to smaller biotechs that typically depend on successful development of singular drugs, dropped as much as 2.4%.Worries that there could be a moving bar for drug approvals add to the recent jolt from reports that antitrust enforcers have their eye on mergers between drug developers. The biotechnology industry relies heavily on successful drug development and partnerships and acquisitions to push forward new technologies for patients while keeping investors flush with cash.The extended review of AbbVie’s filing on Rinvoq as a treatment for adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis sent shares of the drugmaker spiraling the most in about a year. The stock fell as much as 7.3% as Wall Street weighed what was next for the up-and-coming blockbuster medicine.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli wrote that peak yearly sales hopes of $8 billion would be “severely hampered” if the medicine gets a strict warning for the threat of bloodclots like Pfizer Inc.’s Xeljanz has.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",FDA Pushback on AbbVie Drug Raises More Alarms for Biotechnology

2021-04-30,"Theoretically, we really should have seen a renaissance in value stocks during the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. With an unprecedented crisis rippling throughout the international community, the global equity markets initially tumbled on the mass spread of the disease. If anyone wanted to go contrarian, they should have done so on the companies that now presented excellent value. Instead, risk-on money poured into growth names like a thunderstorm. Indeed, much of the enthusiasm was understandable. For instance, tech firms that specialized in contactless services — digital documentation and teleconferencing come to mind — performed extraordinarily well. At the same time, you’d figure that value stocks should also get some love. No, they might not carry the sexiness that growth plays do. However, many, if not most, value stocks are tied to stable, relevant industries. Quite a few pay dividends, which add to their appeal. In other words, these are organizations that simply got caught in a downdraft through no fault of their own. Therefore, it’s plausible that they can make a comeback down the line.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Another reason to consider value stocks is that their growth counterparts tend to peter out when their catalysts fade. I think that’s the number one risk for equity units that received extreme bullishness. Usually, such bullish cycles also tend to correct substantially. So, investors should consider value stocks to diversify their exposure to these crazy markets. 10 of the Top Nasdaq Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Of course, just because you go with value stocks over growth names doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re guaranteed to move higher in the years ahead. This is the capital markets we’re talking about and anything can change. On this list, I’ve included a mix of companies with different risk-reward profiles, proving that value doesn’t always have to be so square. Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Altria Group (NYSE:MO) The Geo Group (NYSE:GEO) Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) Anheuser Busch (NYSE:BUD) Value Stocks to Buy: Nintendo (NTDOY) Source: ESOlex / Shutterstock.com Though the current talking point centers on electric vehicles, in my view, video games also deserve consideration for a renaissance. During the advent of this sector, many people considered it to be child’s play. As a former nerd — well, maybe that hasn’t changed — I can attest to many of the stereotypes of avid gamers. But the Covid-19 crisis also sparked a mini-renaissance in this sector. According to a Nielsen survey, 55% of Americans played video games to wile away the hours during the initial phase of lockdowns. An early 2021 TheVerge.com article argues that this habit is here to stay. That benefits Nintendo, one of the rare gaming-related value stocks. While other video game companies skyrocketed off the pandemic’s unexpected catalyst, NTDOY stock still offers a great value proposition. Currently, its forward price-earnings ratio is 18.5, whereas the interactive media industry — of which Nintendo is a part — has a median forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29. Also, NTDOY stock is down 11% for the year, which contrasts with other gaming rivals. It might not get the love because of its underlying family friendly orientation. But in my view, this is a positive, making NTDOY one of the best value stocks to consider. NRG Energy (NRG) Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com In late 2020, shares of NRG Energy looked poised to go gangbusters and they pretty much did. As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, NRG Energy is one of the biggest power generators and retailers in Texas. Unfortunately, a terrible winter storm devastated the Lone Star State and affected regions are still picking up the pieces. According to the Houston Chronicle, NRG stated that “it lost an estimated $750 million from February’s winter storm that knocked out generators and electricity across the state.” To be fair, this is one of the trickier value stocks in that the underlying company isn’t totally faultless. This was a disaster that culminated with many fail points being checked off one after the other. In hindsight, both public and private elements should have cooperated to bolster energy infrastructures in case stuff like this happened. I mean, there was recent precedent, with rolling blackouts in California. Still, this was mostly an Act of God and NRG stock got caught out. 7 Marijuana Stocks to Buy As Canada’s Consumption Continues to Rise However, this does make the company one of the undervalued stocks in the energy space, with a forward P/E ratio of 13.5 times, whereas the industry median is 19.5 times. Value Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com When the coronavirus first became an unwanted guest in the U.S., it was a matter of time before the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread everywhere. Frankly, it was a shame because initially, the Former President Donald Trump’s administration had the right response: keep people out, including infected Americans. As the Washington Post stated, the former president was not told Covid-19 sickened Americans would be flown home from a Diamond Princess cruise ship. In my opinion, this represented total failure of governance and respect for the chain of command. And with Trump not displaying the best performance under pressure, the American outbreak became an inevitability. Cynically, this benefitted biotechnology firms developing vaccines and treatments. But AbbVie? Not so much since the company didn’t make as aggressive of a pivot to Covid-19 like its peers. However, now that coronavirus cases are fading in the U.S., ABBV stock has become one of the more intriguing value stocks to consider. In large part, I say this because of its Botox business. You see, when people are quarantining, there’s not much emphasis on looking good. Once the pandemic fades, superficiality will be back on the bandwagon. Therefore, ABBV stock makes sense on the fundamentals shifting favorably toward its underlying business. Altria Group (MO) Source: defotoberg / Shutterstock.com As one of the undervalued stocks in the vice industry, Altria Group may not be for everyone’s sensibilities. Also, MO stock is rather risky. Over the trailing five years, shares have lost 24% of market value. Much of that is due to declining smoking rates. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the percentage of those who quit increased from 50.8% in 2005 to 59% in 2016. The FDA is also planning a ban on flavored cigarettes and cigars. Still, the CDC points out that nearly 38 million Americans smoked cigarettes either everyday or some days in 2016. With the pandemic, this figure may have accelerated. Sure, you hear stories about people quitting because of the pandemic. But the crisis also incentivizes the dangerous habit due to increased stress. Another cynical factor that might aid MO stock is the war against vaping. On the surface, vaping seems like a less-offensive alternative to “analog” cigarettes. But the “Preventing Online Sales of E-Cigarettes to Children (PACT) Act has forced many companies to discontinue U.S. online sales and even cease operations altogether,” according to TobaccoReporter.com. 7 Stocks to Buy for May If this trend continues, it could spark a rise in traditional cigarette smoking, which makes Altria an interesting though controversial name to consider. Value Stocks to Buy: The Geo Group (GEO) Source: JosephRouse / Shutterstock.com On the surface, The Geo Group’s specialty, adult rehabilitation, doesn’t sound controversial at all. Until you realize that the company is really talking about private prisons. Naturally, GEO is one of the ugliest value stocks available. Nevertheless, the underlying business of GEO stock has a long series of pros and cons. Of course, there’s something unsavory about investors benefitting off the misery of others. People are in prison to pay their debt to society. It’s not necessarily an avenue from which to extract profit. So why have GEO stock at all? The answer is that government is rarely the best solution, whether we’re talking about advancing capitalistic enterprises or for doling out punitive measures. Turns out, private prisons, because they’re private, can do the job more effectively, potentially leading to lower recidivism. While that might sound like a benefit to taxpayers, you should know that various research papers provide conflicting analyses. Therefore, if you are a conscientious investor, you may want to dig a little deeper before considering GEO as one of your value stocks. Sunoco (SUN) Source: Gergely Zsolnai/Shutterstock.com Technically, Sunoco isn’t exactly what you think about when you discuss value stocks. Indeed, Sunoco’s P/E ratio is 21 times, which is notably higher than the median 16-times ratio seen in the oil and gas industry. But, as a countering statistic, the forward P/E ratio of SUN stock is 9.5 times, which is lower than the industry median 34-times ratio. So, what to do about Sunoco? Personally, I view the company as undervalued relative to its fundamentals. According to its website, Sunoco is one of the largest fuel distribution providers in the U.S. Obviously, that wasn’t the most helpful sector to ply your trade in during the initial onslaught of the Covid-19 crisis. But with cases fading, the narrative for SUN stock has conversely improved significantly. 7 Hot Stocks to Buy Because of Soaring Sales As well, general reticence toward getting a Covid-19 vaccine may help the fuel distribution industry. These folks may not want to get vaccinated, but they might not want to take unnecessary risks either. Therefore, if they travel, they might do so by road, not by air. Value Stocks to Buy: Anheuser Busch (BUD) Source: legacy1995 / Shutterstock.com Admittedly, Anheuser Busch is a disappointment. It may very well be one of the most disappointing value stocks in the market. You’d think that with the company controlling some very popular beer brands that BUD stock would perform much better than it has (not including the “small numbers comparison” resulting from the initial Covid impact). Much of this has to do with changing demographics and consumer habits. Generally speaking, there’s a shift among millennials and Generation Z to hard cider rather than beer. Also, it doesn’t help that young people drink less alcohol than prior generations. Naturally, this had Anheuser Busch scrambling for answers. Now, this might be a stretch, but brewing economic factors may tilt the needle more favorably for BUD stock. According to Statista.com, U.S. household debt hit a new high. Largely, the culprit was mortgages. Thanks to a ridiculous housing market where people bid up available homes to the moon, individuals participating in the craze just don’t have as much disposable income available. This may create an environment where beggars can’t be choosers. You want to get buzzed? Forget your apple cider — it’s Bud Light for you (yuck!).

2021-05-04,"AbbVie (ABBV) is off to a good start going by its impressive 1Q 2021 results. Net revenues increased by 51% year-over-year to $13.01 billion. The drug-maker generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.95 as the adjusted gross margin came in at 83.9%. CEO Richard Gonzalez stated, “Our new products are delivering impressive performance and we are on the cusp of potential commercial approvals for more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years – including five expected approvals in 2021"". AbbVie has made an application for the approval of Skyrizi, a novel treatment for adults with active psoriatic arthritis. The company also delivered positive results from the Phase 3 induction study of Rinvoq to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. (See AbbVie stock analysis on TipRanks) During the quarter, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) accepted AbbVie's New Drug Application for an orally administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist (gepant) for migraine treatment in adults. The company also submitted a new drug application (NDA) for pilocarpine 1.25% for the treatment of presbyopia. Following the impressive 1Q results, AbbVie's management raised its guidance for the full year. GAAP diluted EPS is now expected between $7.27 and $7.47, up from the initial guidance of between $6.69 and $6.89. In addition, Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan reiterated a Buy rating on AbbVie following the strong beat in 1Q. Divan told investors, “With a diversified new product story, robust near-term growth and good visibility into its longer-term growth prospects, we continue to see AbbVie as an especially compelling investment opportunity, especially when one considers the discount it trades at and its robust dividend.” The analyst has a $128 price target on AbbVie, implying approximately 11.6% upside potential to current levels. Analysts on Wall Street are optimistic about AbbVie's long-term prospects. Consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 1 Hold. The average analyst price target of $128.10 implies 11.7% upside potential to current levels. ABBV scores a “Perfect 10” on the TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying it is well-positioned to outperform market expectations.

2021-05-07,"Nowadays, it’s very popular for younger investors to get their advice on social media forums or from YouTube financial gurus. To me, it sounds like the blind leading the blind. Every year, a new hotshot claims to have the inside path to profitable stocks to buy. And more often than not, the market eventually blindsides them. That’s why folks should listen to those who’ve been there before like Warren Buffett. For one thing, Warren Buffett has been investing in blue-chip stocks since the birth of Christ. He’s lived through multiple economic and market cycles so nothing really surprises him. Yes, the individual stocks to buy may look different but in the end, it comes down to the free market principles of supply and demand. And one of the best teachers of profitability exploiting such dynamics is experience. Yet we should realize that Warren Buffett was once young too. Born on Aug. 30, 1930, Buffett graduated from high school when he was 17 years old. He never intended to go to college. However, his father insisted that he attend the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. But the younger Buffett only stayed two years, “complaining that he knew more than his professors,” according to The Balance contributor Joshua Kennon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This sounds to me like Warren Buffett was the original YouTube guru. But the difference is that unlike all the junk that you see on the blogosphere, he knew what he was talking about. Eventually, he would amass a financial empire that would allow him to take control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). If you read his bio, you’ll find that Buffett wasn’t just great at picking stocks to buy — he was a real OG. 7 Stocks to Buy Right Now With All Eyes on Crypto In my view, if you’re going to learn from somebody, it should be a person like Buffett, a man who was born during the Great Depression, went through his youthful exuberance phase, formed a time-proven investment strategy and still continues to fight like the best of ‘em at 90 freaking years old! Below are some key stocks to buy from the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway. AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) American Express (NYSE:AXP) Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) Itochu Corporation (OTCMKTS:ITOCF) Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) Now, I should note that despite my high praise for Warren Buffett, he’s not the ultimate arbiter of equity valuations: the market is. Even though these stocks to buy are compelling because they’re on the Berkshire list, nothing is infallible. Maintain money management discipline and a long-term prospective, though, and you should do well in the end. Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com Berkshire Hathaway has a number of healthcare-related companies on its list. But the one that caught my attention was AbbVie. Yes, I have some personal bias in that I’ve discussed the bullish case for ABBV stock. But well beyond that, I like to think that Warren Buffett and I are on the same wavelength — well, at least as long AbbVie specifically is concerned. Yes, everybody knows AbbVie as one of the giant pharmaceutical stocks to buy. It’s perhaps most popular for the drug Humira, which has been formulated to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and psoriasis, among many other conditions. As well, AbbVie features an extensive list of oncology-related solutions. Should the novel coronavirus outbreak fade out completely, the treatment for long-term diseases should take precedence based on pent-up demand, if you will. But what may really drive ABBV stock is Botox, which came under the AbbVie umbrella when it acquired Allergan. During the Covid-19 lockdowns, there was little incentive to look good. Now that we’re slowly but surely returning to our normal schedules, we have a “right” to be vainer. Cynically, this is good news for ABBV, making it one of the best Berkshire-held stocks to buy. Amazon (AMZN) Source: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com Admittedly, Berkshire doesn’t have nearly as much allocation toward Amazon shares as it does many of its other holdings. At only a 0.1% stake, it’s not Buffett’s highest-conviction trade, that’s for sure. Still, a 0.1% stake is a non-zero number, which means AMZN is one of the stocks to buy or at least to consider. I’m going to get the bad stuff out of the way. Certainly, you can’t deny that AMZN stock has a PR problem. Back during the early days of the Covid-19 crisis, many workers demanded basic dignities, such as paid time off for employees who were sick or displayed Covid-19 symptoms. Not helping matters is that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos consistently swapped places with elite tycoons as the richest person in the world. Yeah, we can talk all day about free market capitalism but come on — sometimes enough is enough. Still, despite the troubles, Amazon’s relevance can’t be denied. When the brick and mortars had to shut down based on government mandates, e-commerce filled the gap. And Amazon dominates e-commerce. 7 Hot Stocks to Consider for a Greener Future While the percentage of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has come down since the peak of the crisis, it’s still very much elevated from pre-pandemic norms. I don’t see this reversing anytime soon, which is why Berkshire includes it on its list of stocks to buy. Stocks to Buy: American Express (AXP) Source: Shutterstock For me, American Express represents a perhaps delusional notion that in certain circumstances, Warren Buffett and I think alike. Generally speaking, I’m somewhat hesitant on credit cards. Certainly, I can see their appeal in the present context. Throughout most of last year, the Covid-19 crisis deflated consumer sentiment, which naturally boosted the personal saving rate. Today, with much of the economy reopening, consumers are ready to spend. Further, you have the stimulus checks that former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden signed off on. Thank you, gentlemen. But will such measures really boost spending holistically? Sure, I get the narrative that spending will rise because Americans want to catch up on their retail therapy. But credit cards are debt instruments and consumers historically haven’t shown much restraint with debt instruments. But AXP stock may not suffer from such concerns as the underlying company caters to wealthier individuals. It seems that the folks at Berkshire Hathaway understand this point very clearly. AXP features an 18.9% stake. In contrast, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both have a 0.5% stake. So if you’re going to get Buffett-inspired credit card stocks to buy, go for American Express. Charter Communications (CHTR) Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com A classic Warren Buffett move, the inclusion of Charter Communications by Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t surprise me in the least. As a telecommunications and mass-media company under the Charter Spectrum brand name, CHTR was one of the most relevant stocks to buy. Providing high-speed cable and fiber-internet access, along with mobile services, Charter is integral to our modern infrastructure. But with the Covid-19 crisis, CHTR stock became even more ingrained. With millions of white-collar workers forced to operate out of their living rooms, reliable high-speed internet services commanded a premium. Not that it should bear any influence on whether you should acquire shares of Charter Communications but I personally made the switch to Spectrum and I couldn’t be happier. While anecdotal, I’ll tell you what makes CHTR compelling among the Buffett-inspired stocks to buy. Yes, Spectrum’s coverage area spans 44 states. But it’s also where they dominate that matters. For instance, Spectrum has the widest coverage in California, Texas and New York. When you combine the GDP of these three states, you’re talking about $6.55 trillion of economic activity. 8 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Earnings Such a combined entity would make it the third-biggest country in the world, usurping Japan. Thus, CHTR is sticking around, which is why Berkshire owns it. Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX) Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com Chevron might be one of the surprising stocks to buy on the Berkshire Hathaway list, prompting criticism that perhaps Buffett might be losing it. As you know, American consumers have gravitated toward electric vehicles. And that’s not just a “fashion statement.” Millennials care about sustainability and growing evidence suggests that Generation Z is taking cues, increasing the magnitude of holistic awareness. On the surface, CVX stock doesn’t seem to make much sense. Yes, Chevron and the big oil machinery are relevant today. But tomorrow, the tide will likely turn. It’s not just millennials that consistently influence current affairs. More significantly, government leadership is also pivoting toward a cleaner, more sustainable future. Obviously, the Biden administration wishes to push its environmental protection agenda. Up and coming politicians will probably carry the torch. Big oil stocks to buy are done for. Then again, maybe not. I think CVX may represent a case of Buffett’s contrarianism. This is speculation on my part but it’s possible that Buffett and the Berkshire team don’t view the electrification of transportation as economically viable just yet. Even if it became so, Buffett probably recognizes that oil will be around for a very long time, in part due to the high energy density of fossil fuels. So yeah, CVX is a keeper. Itochu Corporation (ITOCF) Source: VladSV / Shutterstock.com I’m familiar with most of the stocks to buy under the Berkshire umbrella. But the name that caught me by surprise was Itochu Corporation. Frankly, I understand both value and growth investors pivot to Asia. However, this almost always means Chinese companies. On the other hand, Japan hasn’t been making much news aside from deflation-related headlines. So why Itochu? If somebody would ask that question to Warren Buffett, I’d be most grateful as it would give us all a deeper insight into one of the world’s greatest investors. But if I had to guess, it would be Itochu’s exposure to world-class Japanese manufacturing. Itochu is one of Japan’s biggest general trading companies and thus touches on many relevant sectors. But the underlying theme is manufacturing. Interestingly, Harvard Business Review did a story on Japan’s manufacturing prowess. Initially, business experts attributed its outperformance to superior methodologies. But later, these same experts noted that Japan’s production attributes were contradictory to commonly held beliefs: “…many Japanese factories practicing lean manufacturing appeared to surpass their U.S. counterparts on several dimensions; they achieved lower cost, higher quality, faster product introductions, and greater flexibility, all at the same time.” 7 Consumer Stocks to Buy Before Picnic Season Begins In other words, there’s something in the water when it comes to Japanese manufacturing. Buffett might be recognizing this, thus explaining the inclusion of ITOCF stock. Stocks to Buy: Verisign (VRSN) Source: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com Warren Buffett is old. But what I really appreciate about him is that he continues to defy stereotypes. Honestly, at 90 years old, he should be referred to in the past tense. But he’s still out there, leading one of the biggest companies in the world. Good for him and it’s a powerful lesson for all of us. What I especially like is that Buffett isn’t just out there as a charity case. Instead, he’s making bold calls regarding stocks to buy, one of them being Verisign. Well before anyone knew about the SARS-CoV-2 virus, VRSN was an incredibly relevant idea due to its internet network infrastructure operations, including managing the registry for .com and .net domains. That’s serious influence right there. But Covid-19 has dramatically changed the paradigm of work. Though many employees are heading back to the office, several organizations — including high-level blue chips — remain open-minded about a full return to normal. And a ton of them are not in a hurry to have everyone clocking back in. There’s also the narrative that many folks who got a taste of the gig worker’s life want to maintain such freedom. To be fair, I’m not sure if companies will allow employees to work 100% from home. Therefore, we could see an increase in independent contract work, which should bolster Verisign’s business. Overall, VRSN stock is one to watch closely as we navigate the post-Covid world.

2021-05-10,"AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV) is making an opportunistic play to boost the aesthetics business by adding a long-delayed body sculpting product into the fold. AbbVie’s Allergan Aesthetics unit will pay 0 million in cash to scoop up Soliton Inc (NASDAQ: SOLY) and Resonic, its sound-wave device that improves the appearance of cellulite. Under the terms of the transaction, Allergan Aesthetics will pay $22.60 per share in cash for each outstanding share of Soliton. The body sculpting offering will help add some heft to the Allergan Aesthetics brand, which includes cosmetic Botox as its most visible product. AbbVie propped up the aesthetics business as part of its $63 billion buyout of Allergan last year, keeping Botox’s therapeutic indications under the AbbVie brand. Allergan Aesthetics already has a product in CoolSculpting Elite. Still, the Soliton pickup adds a non-invasive option in Resonic, which also holds approval in tattoo removal alongside lasers and improves the appearance of fibrotic scars. Cosmetic Botox cleared $447 million in the first quarter, a 44.7% Y/Y increase. The unit, on the whole, made $1.14 billion in sales on the quarter. Meanwhile, the overall AbbVie business cleared more than $13 billion in sales on the quarter, led once again by Humira at $3.9 billion. Price Action: SOLY shares are up 23.7% at $22.27, while ABBV shares are up 0.31% at $116.12 during the market trading session on the last check Monday.

2021-05-11,"AbbVie’s (ABBV) Allergan Aesthetics is to acquire Soliton (SOLY) plus its Rapid Acoustic Pulse device, which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The acquisition will expand the company’s body contouring treatment portfolio. The acquisition is built around Resonic, the Rapid Acoustic Pulse device that uses rapid pulses of acoustic shockwaves to help fade unwanted tattoo ink. It also helps in disintegrating fat deposits for short-term improvement in cellulite appearance. The technology is poised to address a massive unmet need in modifying the appearance of cellulite. “The addition of this technology complements Allergan Aesthetics' portfolio of body contouring treatments. Health care providers will now have another option to address consumers' aesthetic concerns”, said AbbVie Senior Vice President Carrie Strom. Under the terms of the deal, the AbbVie unit is to pay $22.60 per share for each Soliton’s outstanding shares, valuing the deal at about $550 million. The two companies’ boards of directors have already approved the transaction. The deal should be sealed upon fulfillment of customary closing conditions. The acquisition of Soliton comes on the heels of AbbVie's report of impressive Q1 2021 results, with sales and earnings coming in above estimates. Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan has since reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, citing results that beat expectations. (See AbbVie stock analysis on TipRanks). “With a diversified new product story, robust near-term growth and good visibility into its longer-term growth prospects, we continue to see AbbVie as an especially compelling investment opportunity, especially when one considers the discount it trades at and its robust dividend,” Divan wrote. Divan has a $128 price target on the stock implying 10.14% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 2 Holds. The average analyst price target of $126 implies 8.42% upside potential to current levels. ABBV scores an 8 out of 10 on the TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying it is well-positioned to outperform the overall market.

Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House Oversight Committee.

2021-05-18,"AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV) significantly inflated prices over the past two decades for patients in the U.S. who take the drugs Humira and Imbruvica, a report released by the House Oversight and Reform Committee found. The committee concluded that the price increases led to billions of dollars in corporate revenue and hefty bonuses for company executives. “AbbVie pursued a variety of tactics to increase drug sales while raising prices for Americans, including exploiting the patent system to extend its market monopoly, abusing orphan drug protections to further block competition, and engaging in anticompetitive pricing practices,” the report states. The report comes after the panel reviewed more than 170,000 internal data, documents, and communications related to the medications over the last 18 years. Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., issued a subpoena for the documents last year because the company refused to cooperate with a previous request for the materials. A representative for AbbVie did not respond to a request for comment. Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment, was released in 2003 when the company was Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie has since raised the cost frequently, and by more than 470%, with an annual supply now costing about $77,000, the report said. In 2020 alone, AbbVie reported billion in U.S. net revenue for Humira. AbbVie faces no current competition in the U.S. from biosimilar versions of Humira, even though six biosimilars have received FDA approval. Meanwhile, AbbVie, in conjunction with Janssen Biotech, has increased the price of Imbruvica, a drug used to treat mantle cell lymphoma and other cancers, by 82% since it launched in 2013. In 2013, the drug was priced at $99,776 annually. Today, it’s priced at $181,529. Experts estimate that by 2026, Imbruvica will be the fourth best-selling drug in the U.S. Today’s full committee hybrid hearing with AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez and experts on pricing practices for Humira and Imbruvica has begun at 10:00 a.m. ET.

Data were presented at the Clinical Science Late-Breaking Abstract Plenary session. The results showed that Stelara failed to meet the primary endpoint of statistical superiority versus AbbVie Inc's (NYSE: ABBV) Humira (adalimumab). At the 52-week mark, 64.9% of Stelara patients had hit clinical remission, compared with 61% of patients taking Humira, a numerical difference but not a statistically significant one. Digging deeper into the data, Stelara demonstrated high rates of clinical remission, corticosteroid-free remission, clinical response, and endoscopic response through one year in biologic-naïve patients, but none were statistically significant. Around 61% of patients on the J&J drug hit corticosteroid-free remission versus 57.4% of Humira patients. Around 6% more patients on Stelara achieved clinical response than those on Humira, and self-reported symptom remission was about 1% higher in the Stelara arm. Meanwhile, Humira helped around 3% more patients hit clinical remission by week 16. It also fared slightly better than Stelara at helping certain patients achieve endoscopic remission. A safety difference in Stelara's favor was observed. Specifically, 6.3% of Stelara patients and 11.3% of Humira patients stopped treatment because of side effects.
